He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective.\a147It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don\a146t change, either. I hope the same can be said of him?\a148Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom.\a147I think he\a146s in bed and asleep,\a148 he said.It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer\a146s day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend\a146s hours to feel no surprise at the idea.\a147That means a case, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I\a146m frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. \a145When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?\a146 Mrs. Hudson asked. \a145Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,\a146 said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case.\a148\a147Yes, Billy, I know.\a148\a147He\a146s following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now.\a148 Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. \a147That\a146s part of the old woman\a146s outfit,\a148 he said.\a147But what is it all about, Billy?\a148Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. \a147I don\a146t mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It\a146s this case of the Crown diamond.\a148\a147What\a151 the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?\a148\a147Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere\a151\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147Yes, sir, you know what that means. He\a146s a stiff\a146un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I\a146ve nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can\a146t stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don\a146t believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He\a146d rather he failed.\a148\a147And Mr. Holmes knows it?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.\a148\a147Well, we\a146ll hope he won\a146t fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We\a146ve got something funny behind it.\a148Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window.Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air.\a147We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more lifelike. I wouldn\a146t dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it\a146s up you can see this from across the way.\a148\a147We used something of the sort once before.\a148\a147Before my time,\a148 said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. \a147There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself.\a148Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more.\a147That will do, Billy,\a148 said he. \a147You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can\a146t do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment.\a148\a147So I gather.\a148\a147You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?\a148\a147Danger of what, Holmes?\a148\a147Of sudden death. I\a146m expecting something this evening.\a148\a147Expecting what?\a148\a147To be murdered, Watson.\a148\a147No, no, you are joking, Holmes!\a148\a147Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days.\a148\a147But why not eat?\a148\a147Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.\a148\a147But this danger, Holmes?\a148\a147Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name\a151 Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N. W. Got it?\a148Watson\a146s honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.\a147Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two.\a148\a147Your morals don\a146t improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.\a148\a147Not such important ones. But can\a146t you have this fellow arrested?\a148\a147Yes, Watson, I could. That\a146s what worries him so.\a148\a147But why don\a146t you?\a148\a147Because I don\a146t know where the diamond is.\a148\a147Ah! Billy told me\a151 the missing Crown jewel!\a148\a147Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I\a146ve cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It\a146s the stone I want.\a148\a147And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?\a148\a147Yes, and he\a146s a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam\a146s not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same.\a148\a147Where is this Count Sylvius?\a148\a147I\a146ve been at his very elbow all the morning. You\a146ve seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. \a145By your leave, madame,\a146 said he\a151 half-ltalian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.\a148\a147It might have been tragedy.\a148\a147Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee\a146s workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun\a151 a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?\a148The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.\a147The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.\a148\a147Send for the police.\a148\a147I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?\a148Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.\a147Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.\a148\a147That will be Sam Merton\a151 the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?\a148\a147In the waiting-room, sir.\a148\a147Show him up when I ring.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion.\a147Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you.\a148\a147I should not be surprised.\a148\a147I insist upon staying with you.\a148\a147You would be horribly in the way.\a148\a147In his way?\a148\a147No, my dear fellow\a151 in my way.\a148\a147Well, I can\a146t possibly leave you.\a148\a147Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.\a148Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. \a147Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C. I. D. Come back with the police. The fellow\a146s arrest will follow.\a148\a147I\a146ll do that with joy.\a147Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is.\a148 He touched the bell. \a147I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.\a148It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:\a147Don\a146t break it, Count! Don\a146t break it!\a148The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.\a147It\a146s a pretty little thing,\a148 said Holmes, advancing towards the image. \a147Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.\a148\a147Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?\a148\a147Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes\a146 chat with you. \a148The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.\a147I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won\a146t deny that I intended to assault you just now.\a148Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.\a147I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,\a148 said he. \a147But why these personal attentions?\a148\a147Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track.\a148\a147My creatures! I assure you no!\a148\a147Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes.\a148\a147It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues\a146 gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.\a148\a147Well, \iMr\i Holmes, then.\a148\a147Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.\a148Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.\a147Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day.\a148\a147Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise?\a148\a147It was you\a151 you yourself?\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \a147You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect.\a148\a147If I had known, you might never\a151\a148\a147Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!\a148The Count\a146s knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. \a147What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why?\a148\a147Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147But why?\a148\a147Why? The sport\a151 the excitement\a151 the danger!\a148\a147And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?\a148\a147Exactly!\a148\a147My reasons in a nutshell!\a148The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.\a147Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond!\a148Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.\a147Upon my word!\a148 said he.\a147You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.\a148\a147Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?\a148\a147Where the Crown diamond now is.\a148The Count looked sharply at his companion. \a147Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?\a148\a147You can, and you will.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148\a147You can\a146t bluff me, Count Sylvius.\a148 Holmes\a146s eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. \a147You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind.\a148\a147Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!\a148Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. \a147Then you do know. You have admitted it!\a148\a147I admit nothing.\a148\a147Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not, you will get hurt.\a148Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. \a147And you talk about bluff!\a148 said he.Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook.\a147Do you know what I keep in this book?\a148\a147No, sir, I do not!\a148\a147You!\a148\a147Me!\a148\a147Yes, sir, you! You are all here\a151 every action of your vile and dangerous life.\a148\a147Damn you, Holmes!\a148 cried the Count with blazing eyes. \a147There are limits to my patience!\a148\a147It\a146s all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.\a148\a147You are dreaming!\a148\a147And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.\a148\a147Tut! You will make nothing of that!\a148\a147Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.\a148\a147No, you\a146re wrong there.\a148\a147Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.\a148\a147What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?\a148\a147Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148\a147I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up.\a148The veins stood out on the Count\a146s forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.\a147That\a146s the hand I play from,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I put it all upon the table. But one card is missing. It\a146s the king of diamonds. I don\a146t know where the stone is.\a148\a147You never shall know.\a148\a147No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over\a151 well, I\a146ll compound a felony. We don\a146t want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.\a148\a147But if I refuse?\a148\a147Why, then\a151 alas!\a151 it must be you and not the stone.\a148Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.\a147I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up.\a148\a147If he won\a146t come, sir?\a148\a147No violence, Billy. Don\a146t be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.\a148\a147What are you going to do now?\a148 asked the Count as Billy disappeared.\a147My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together.\a148The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown.\a147You won\a146t die in your bed, Holmes.\a148\a147I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?\a148A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes\a146s figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready.\a147It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,\a148 he said in a quiet voice. \a147You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?\a148The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes\a146s debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help.\a147What\a146s the game now, Count? What\a146s this fellow want? What\a146s up?\a148 His voice was deep and raucous.The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered.\a147If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all up.\a148The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.\a147Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I\a146m not in the funny mood myself.\a148\a147No, I expect not,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I\a146m a busy man and I can\a146t waste time. I\a146m going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman \a145Barcarole\a146 upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?\a148Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.\a147What is it, then?\a148 asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him. \a147Does he know about the stone?\a148\a147He knows a damned sight too much about it. I\a146m not sure that he doesn\a146t know all about it.\a148\a147Good Lord!\a148 The boxer\a146s sallow face turned a shade whiter.\a147Ikey Sanders has split on us.\a148\a147He has, has he? I\a146ll do him down a thick \a146un for that if I swing for it.\a148\a147That won\a146t help us much. We\a146ve got to make up our minds what to do.\a148\a147Half a mo\a146,\a148 said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. \a147He\a146s a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he\a146s not listening?\a148\a147How can he be listening with that music going?\a148\a147That\a146s right. Maybe somebody\a146s behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room.\a148 As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words.\a147Tut! it\a146s only a dummy,\a148 said the Count.\a147A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain\a146t in it. It\a146s the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains Count!\a148\a147Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone.\a148\a147The deuce he can!\a148\a147But he\a146ll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.\a148\a147What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?\a148\a147It\a146s one or the other.\a148Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.\a147He\a146s alone in there. Let\a146s do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.\a148The Count shook his head.\a147He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it\a146s likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?\a148There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.\a147Something in the street,\a148 said Merton. \a147Now look here, guv\a146nor, you\a146ve got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it\a146s up to you.\a148\a147I\a146ve fooled better men than he,\a148 the Count answered. \a147The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.\a148\a147I thought Van Seddar was going next week.\a148\a147He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.\a148\a147But the false bottom ain\a146t ready.\a148\a147Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There\a146s not a moment to lose.\a148 Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.\a147As to Holmes,\a148 he continued, \a147we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won\a146t arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we\a146ll promise him the stone. We\a146ll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country.\a148\a147That sounds good to me!\a148 cried Sam Merton with a grin.\a147You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I\a146ll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I\a146ll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn\a146t in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.\a148\a147I wonder you dare carry it.\a148\a147Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.\a148\a147Let\a146s have a look at it.\a148Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.\a147What\a151 d\a146ye think I\a146m going to snatch it off you? See here, mister, I\a146m getting a bit tired of your ways.\a148\a147Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can\a146t afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here!\a148\a147Thank you!\a148With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy\a146s chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count\a146s head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.\a147No violence, gentlemen\a151 no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below.\a148The Count\a146s bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.\a147But how the deuce\a151?\a148 he gasped.\a147Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.\a148The Count gave a gesture of resignation.\a147We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.\a148\a147Not far from him, at any rate,\a148 Holmes answered with a polite smile.Sam Merton\a146s slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last.\a147A fair cop!\a148 said he. \a147But, I say, what about that bloomin\a146 fiddle! I hear it yet.\a148\a147Tut, tut!\a148 Holmes answered. \a147You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.\a148There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.\a147Lord Cantlemere sir.\a148\a147Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.\a148The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.\a147How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?\a148\a147No, I thank you; I will not take it off.\a148Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.\a147Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.\a148His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.\a147I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.\a148\a147It is difficult\a151 very difficult.\a148\a147I feared that you would find it so.\a148There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier\a146s words and manner.\a147Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.\a148\a147Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.\a148\a147No doubt.\a148\a147Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon\a147You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you.\a148\a147You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.\a148\a147When you have caught them.\a148\a147Exactly. But the question is\a151 how shall we proceed against the receiver?\a148\a147Is this not rather premature?\a148\a147It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?\a148\a147The actual possession of the stone.\a148\a147You would arrest him upon that?\a148\a147Most undoubtedly.\a148Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember.\a147In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.\a148Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks.\a147You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.\a148Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door.\a147One moment, sir,\a148 said he. \a147To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.\a148\a147Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.\a148\a147Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.\a148\a147What do you mean, sir?\a148\a147Come\a151 come, do what I ask.\a148An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.\a147What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty\a151 the very great liberty, I admit\a151 of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.\a148The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.\a147Sir, I am bewildered. But\a151 yes\a151 it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how\a151\a148\a147The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.\a148\p\X1\BThor Bridge\B\X1\c\i\m="thor-07.png" \i\cSomewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatchbox with my name, John H. Watson, M. D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. No less remarkable is that of the cutter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. I need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. There remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others I revere. In some I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. The following narrative is drawn from my own experience.It was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments.\a147You have a case, Holmes?\a148 I remarked.\a147The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,\a148 he answered. \a147It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.\a148\a147Might I share it?\a148\a147There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. Their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the Family Herald which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical.\a148A quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a letter from his pocket.\a147You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?\a148 he said.\a147You mean the American Senator?\a148\a147Well, he was once Senator for some Western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.\a148\a147Yes, I know of him. He has surely lived in England for some time. His name is very familiar.\a148\a147Yes, he bought a considerable estate in Hampshire some five years ago. Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?\a148\a147Of course. I remember it now. That is why the name is familiar. But I really know nothing of the details.\a148Holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. \a147I had no idea that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts ready,\a148 said he. \a147The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner\a146s jury and also in the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.\a148\a147Your client?\a148\a147Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story backward. You had best read this first.\a148T\the letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:\tC\tLARIDGE\a146S HOTEL,\tO\tctober 3rd.\tD\tEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\tI\t can\a146t see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. I can\a146t explain things\a151 I can\a146t even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is innocent. You know the facts\a151 who doesn\a146t? It has been the gossip of the country. And never a voice raised for her! It\a146s the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. That woman has a heart that wouldn\a146t let her kill a fly. Well, I\a146ll come at eleven to-morrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. Maybe I have a clue and don\a146t know it. Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. If ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case.\tY\tours faithfully,\tJ\t. NEIL GIBSON. \t\a147There you have it,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. \a147That is the gentleman I await. As to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. This man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most violent and formidable character. He married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. These are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house, the centre of a historical English state. Then as to the tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. No weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near her, Watson\a151 mark that! The crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o\a146clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?\a148\a147It is all very clear. But why suspect the governess?\a148\a147Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.\a148 His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, \a147On\a151 the\a151 floor\a151 of\a151 her\a151 wardrobe.\a148 Then he sank into silence, and I saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. \a147Yes, Watson, it was found. Pretty damning, eh? So the two juries thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. How\a146s that? Finally there is the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer? Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson\a151 very ugly!\a148\a147Yes, indeed, Holmes.\a148\a147Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near Thor Bridge\a151 that was the scene of the tragedy\a151 about that hour. She couldn\a146t deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there.\a148\a147That really seems final.\a148\a147And yet, Watson\a151 and yet! This bridge\a151 a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides\a151 carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it is called. In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. Such are the main facts. But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.\a148Billy had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an unexpected one. Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching, hesitating manner\a151 a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.\a147You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Pray sit down. I fear I can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.\a148\a147I know you have,\a148 our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath. \a147Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is my employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes, he is a villain\a151 an infernal villain.\a148\a147Strong language, Mr. Bates.\a148\a147I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited. I would not have him find me here for the world. He is almost due now. But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. His secretary, Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.\a148\a147And you are his manager?\a148\a147I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him. Those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was brutal to her\a151 yes, sir, brutal! How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. She was a creature of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know.\a148\a147No, it had escaped me.\a148\a147Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. A child of the sun and of passion. She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded\a151 I am told that they once were great\a151 there was nothing to hold him. We all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. But he is plausible and cunning. That is all I have to say to you. Don\a146t take him at his face value. There is more behind. Now I\a146ll go. No, no, don\a146t detain me! He is almost due.\a148With a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared.\a147Well! Well!\a148 said Holmes after an interval of silence. \a147Mr. Gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. But the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears.\a148Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs, and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. As I looked upon him I understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. If I were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my model. His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. His face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. Cold gray eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.\a147Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he began, \a147that money is nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it\a146s any use in lighting you to the truth. This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it\a146s up to you to do it. Name your figure!\a148\a147My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,\a148 said Holmes coldly. \a147I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\a148\a147Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. If you pull this off every paper in England and America will be booming you. You\a146ll be the talk of two continents.\a148\a147Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming. It may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. But we are wasting time. Let us get down to the facts.\a148\a147I think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports. I don\a146t know that I can add anything which will help you. But if there is anything you would wish more light upon\a151 well, I am here to give it.\a148\a147Well, there is just one point.\a148\a147What is it?\a148\a147What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?\a148The Gold King gave a violent start and half rose from his chair. Then his massive calm came back to him.\a147I suppose you are within your rights\a151 and maybe doing your duty\a151 in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147We will agree to suppose so,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.\a148Holmes rose from his chair.\a147I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,\a148 said he, \a147and I have no time or taste for aimless conversations. I wish you good morning.\a148Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above Holmes. There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.\a147What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?\a148\a147Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain.\a148\a147Plain enough, but what\a146s at the back of it? Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? I\a146ve a right to a plain answer.\a148\a147Well, perhaps you have,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I\a146ll give you one. This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.\a148\a147Meaning that I lie.\a148\a147Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.\a148I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire\a146s face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. Holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe.\a147Don\a146t be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.\a148With an effort the Gold King mastered his fury. I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.\a147Well, it\a146s your choice. I guess you know how to run your own business. I can\a146t make you touch the case against your will. You\a146ve done yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me and was the better for it.\a148\a147So many have said so, and yet here I am,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147Well, good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You have a good deal yet to learn.\a148Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.\a147Any views, Watson?\a148 he asked at last.\a147Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me\a151\a148\a147Exactly. And to me also.\a148\a147But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you discover them?\a148\a147Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. We\a146ve got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. You saw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and how imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.\a148\a147Perhaps he will come back?\a148\a147He is sure to come back. He must come back. He can\a146t leave it where it is. Ha! isn\a146t that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat overdue.\a148The Gold King had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end.\a147I\a146ve been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. You are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it. I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me don\a146t really touch this case.\a148\a147That is for me to decide, is it not?\a148\a147Yes, I guess that is so. You\a146re like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.\a148\a147Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case.\a148\a147That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with a woman may be\a151 if there is really some serious feeling in the case. I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don\a146t welcome intruders. And you burst suddenly into it. But the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open, and you can explore where you will. What is it you want?\a148\a147The truth.\a148The Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.\a147I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he at last. \a147There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I won\a146t go deeper than is needful. I met my wife when I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto was the daughter of a government official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the American women whom I had known. Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married her. It was only when the romance had passed\a151 and it lingered for years\a151 that I realized that we had nothing\a151 absolutely nothing\a151 in common. My love faded. If hers had faded also it might have been easier. But you know the wonderful way of women! Do what I might, nothing could turn her from me. If I have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. But nothing changed her. She adored me in those English woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might, she was as devoted as ever.\a147Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I do not blame you for feeling it. I should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection.\a148\a147Well, maybe so,\a148 said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. \a147I\a146m not pretending to be any better than I am. I guess all my life I\a146ve been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. I told her so.\a148\a147Oh, you did, did you?\a148Holmes could look very formidable when he was moved.\a147I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out of my power. I said that money was no object and that all I could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done.\a148\a147Very generous, I am sure,\a148 said Holmes with a sneer.\a147See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. I\a146m not asking for your criticism.\a148\a147It is only for the young lady\a146s sake that I touch your case at all,\a148 said Holmes sternly. \a147I don\a146t know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. Some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences.\a148To my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity.\a147That\a146s how I feel myself about it now. I thank God that my plans did not work out as I intended. She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly.\a148\a147Why did she not?\a148\a147Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. When I had sworn\a151 as I did\a151 that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. But there was another reason. She knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. She wanted to use it for good.\a148\a147How?\a148\a147Well, she knew something of my affairs. They are large, Mr. Holmes\a151 large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. I can make or break\a151 and it is usually break. It wasn\a146t individuals only. It was communities, cities, even nations. Business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played the game for all it was worth. I never squealed myself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. She found that I listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. So she stayed\a151 and then this came along.\a148\a147Can you throw any light upon that?\a148The Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought.\a147It\a146s very black against her. I can\a146t deny that. And women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man. At first I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. One explanation came into my head. I give it to you, Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause\a151 and I think she understood this\a151 for the latter, she was aware that this English girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred and the heat of the Amazon was always in her blood. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar\a151 or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it.\a148\a147That possibility had already occurred to me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.\a148\a147But she utterly denies it.\a148\a147Well, that is not final\a151 is it? One can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. She might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. What is against such a supposition?\a148\a147Miss Dunbar herself.\a148\a147Well, perhaps.\a148Holmes looked at his watch. \a147I have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train. When I have seen this young lady it is very possible that I may be of more use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire.\a148There was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching Winchester that day we went down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of Mr. Neil Gibson. He did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.\a147Anyhow, I\a146d rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play straight, so I\a146ve heard.\a148\a147I need not appear in the matter at all,\a148 said Holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. \a147If I can clear it up I don\a146t ask to have my name mentioned.\a148\a147Well, it\a146s very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, I know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I\a146d breathe it to no soul but you.\a148 He looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words. \a147Don\a146t you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil Gibson himself?\a148\a147I have been considering that.\a148\a147You\a146ve not seen Miss Dunbar. She is a wonderful fine woman in every way. He may well have wished his wife out of the road. And these Americans are readier with pistols than our folk are. It was his pistol, you know.\a148\a147Was that clearly made out?\a148\a147Yes, sir. It was one of a pair that he had.\a148\a147One of a pair? Where is the other?\a148\a147Well, the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another. We never quite matched that particular pistol\a151 but the box was made for two.\a148\a147If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.\a148\a147Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over.\a148\a147Later, perhaps. I think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.\a148This conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant Coventry\a146s humble cottage which served as the local police-station. A walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor Place estate. A path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and half Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground.\a147That was where Mrs. Gibson\a146s body lay. I marked it by that stone.\a148\a147I understand that you were there before it was moved?\a148\a147Yes, they sent for me at once.\a148\a147Who did?\a148\a147Mr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive.\a148\a147That was sensible. I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters.\a148\a147Yes, sir, very close.\a148\a147Near the right temple?\a148\a147Just behind it, sir.\a148\a147How did the body lie?\a148\a147On the back, sir. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The short note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.\a148\a147Clutched, you say?\a148\a147Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.\a148\a147\tThat is of great importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. Dear me! The note, as I remember, was quite short:\tI\t will be at Thor Bridge at nine o\a146clock.\tG\t. DUNBAR. \t\a147Was that not so?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147What was her explanation?\a148\a147Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. She would say nothing.\a148\a147The problem is certainly a very interesting one. The point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?\a148\a147Well, sir,\a148 said the guide, \a147it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case.\a148Holmes shook his head.\a147Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before\a151 say one hour or two. Why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer to it in the interview. Does it not seem remarkable?\a148\a147Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.\a148\a147I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out.\a148 He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his quick gray eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework.\a147This is curious,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. I expect it\a146s been done by some passer-by.\a148The stonework was gray, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. When examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.\a147It took some violence to do that,\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. \a147Yes, it was a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet.\a148\a147But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.\a148\a147Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. It may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth noting. I do not think that we have anything more to learn here. There were no footsteps, you say?\a148\a147The ground was iron hard, sir. There were no traces at all.\a148\a147Then we can go. We will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. Then we shall get on to Winchester, for I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.\a148Mr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr. Bates who had called upon us in the morning. He showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of firearms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life.\a147Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods,\a148 said he. \a147He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified.\a148\a147Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?\a148\a147No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as bad\a151 words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.\a148\a147Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,\a148 remarked Holmes as we made our way to the station. \a147Well, Watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way from my conclusion. In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr. Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8:30 and all was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. There is no evidence at all that Mr. Gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o\a146clock. On the other hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gibson at the bridge. Beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence. We have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. I must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing.\a148\a147And what is that, Holmes?\a148\a147The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.\a148\a147Dear me, Holmes!\a148 I cried, \a147that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all.\a148\a147Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.\a148\a147I hardly follow you.\a148\a147Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have your weapon. The crime is done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson, and yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.\a148\a147In the excitement of the moment?\a148\a147No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.\a148\a147But there is so much to explain.\a148\a147Well, we shall set about explaining it. When once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. For example, there is this revolver. Miss Dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. Who placed it there? Someone who wished to incriminate her. Was not that person the actual criminal? You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry.\a148We were compelled to spend the night at Winchester, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr. Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. I had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me. It was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself\a151 something which could control and guide him. One felt, too, as one looked at the strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. She was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them the appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. Now, as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us.\a147Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?\a148 she asked in a low, agitated voice.\a147Yes,\a148 Holmes answered, \a147you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr. Gibson\a146s statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. But why was the whole situation not brought out in court?\a148\a147It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. I thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. But I understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious.\a148\a147My dear young lady,\a148 cried Holmes earnestly, \a147I beg you to have no illusions upon the point. Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. Give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth.\a148\a147I will conceal nothing.\a148\a147Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr. Gibson\a146s wife.\a148\a147She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. I would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing could justify me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.\a148\a147Now, Miss Dunbar,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.\a148\a147I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points\a151 the most vital points\a151 which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.\a148\a147If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.\a148\a147With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning. It lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. It implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. I saw no reason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment. She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the schoolroom grate. She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview.\a148\a147Yet she kept your reply very carefully?\a148\a147Yes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died.\a148\a147Well, what happened then?\a148\a147I went down as I had promised. When I reached the bridge she was waiting for me. Never did I realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me. She was like a mad woman\a151 indeed, I think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. How else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will not say what she said. She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not even answer\a151 I could not. It was dreadful to see her. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.\a148\a147Where she was afterwards found?\a148\a147Within a few yards from the spot.\a148\a147And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?\a148\a147No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which happened.\a148\a147You say that you returned to your room. Did you leave it again before next morning?\a148\a147Yes, when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I ran out with the others.\a148\a147Did you see Mr. Gibson?\a148\a147Yes, he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.\a148\a147Did he seem to you much perturbed?\a148\a147Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. I do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned.\a148\a147Then we come to the all-important point. This pistol that was found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?\a148\a147Never, I swear it.\a148\a147When was it found?\a148\a147Next morning, when the police made their search.\a148\a147Among your clothes?\a148\a147Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses.\a148\a147You could not guess how long it had been there?\a148\a147It had not been there the morning before.\a148\a147How do you know?\a148\a147Because I tidied out the wardrobe.\a148\a147That is final. Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you.\a148\a147It must have been so.\a148\a147And when?\a148\a147It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.\a148\a147As you were when you got the note?\a148\a147Yes, from that time onward for the whole morning.\a148\a147Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?\a148\a147I can think of none.\a148\a147There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge\a151 a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. Could you suggest any possible explanation of that?\a148\a147Surely it must be a mere coincidence.\a148\a147Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. Why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and why at the very place?\a148\a147But what could have caused it? Only great violence could have such an effect.\a148Holmes did not answer. His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action.\a147Come, Watson, come!\a148 he cried.\a147What is it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make England ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through.\a148It was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me\a151 we had a first-class carriage to ourselves\a151 and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.\a147Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.\a148It was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him of the fact.\a147Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters. But have you your revolver on you?\a148I produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care.\a147It\a146s heavy\a151 remarkably heavy,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, it is a solid bit of work.\a148He mused over it for a minute.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.\a148\a147My dear Holmes, you are joking.\a148\a147No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction.\a148I had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.\a147A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?\a148\a147It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson\a146s revolver,\a148 said my friend. \a147Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?\a148The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.\a147I think that this is all we will need,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, if you please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our journey.\a148The sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. The sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. As we approached the scene of the crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated.\a147Yes,\a148 he said in answer to my remark, \a147you have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet\a151 and yet\a151 Well, Watson, we can but try.\a148As he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. With great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. He then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. This he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. He then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side.\a147Now for it!\a148 he cried.At the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected.\a147Was there ever a more exact demonstration?\a148 he cried. \a147See, Watson, your revolver has solved the problem!\a148 As he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade.\a147We\a146ll stay at the inn to-night,\a148 he continued as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. \a147You will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend\a146s revolver. You will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gibson know that I will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar\a146s vindication.\a148Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.\a147I fear, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that you will not improve any reputation which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.\a147It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman\a146s mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. Whether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. Her first resolution was to end her own life. Her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be.\a147We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. This alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.\a147Then she took one of her husband\a146s revolvers\a151 there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house\a151 and kept it for her own use. A similar one she concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar\a146s wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. The papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. Should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.\a148\p\X1\BThe Creeping Man\B\X1\c\i\m="CREE-02.png"\i\cMr. Sherlock Holmes was always of opinion that I should publish the singular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the university and were echoed in the learned societies of London. There were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend\a146s adventures. Now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice. Even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public.I\tt was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes\a146s laconic messages:\tC\tome at once if convenient\a151 if inconvenient come all the same. S. H. \tThe relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them. As an institution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. When it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my role was obvious. But apart from this I had uses. I was a whetstone for his mind. I stimulated him. He liked to think aloud in my presence. His remarks could hardly be said to be made to me\a151 many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead\a151 but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that I should register and interject. If I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my humble role in our alliance.When I arrived at Baker Street I found him huddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. With a wave of his hand he indicated my old armchair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and with his usual whimsical smile he greeted me back to what had once been my home.\a147You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective.\a148\a147But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,\a148 said I. \a147Bloodhounds\a151 sleuth-hounds\a151\a148\a147No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. But there is another which is far more subtle. You may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father.\a148\a147Yes, I remember it well.\a148\a147My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.\a148I shook my head. \a147Surely, Holmes, this is a little far-fetched,\a148 said I.He had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment.\a147The practical application of what I have said is very close to the problem which I am investigating. It is a tangled skein, you understand, and I am looking for a loose end. One possible loose end lies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury\a146s wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?\a148I sank back in my chair in some disappointment. Was it for so trivial a question as this that I had been summoned from my work? Holmes glanced across at me.\a147The same old Watson!\a148 said he. \a147You never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. But is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher\a151 you\a146ve heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist?that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolfhound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? What do you make of it?\a148\a147The dog is ill.\a148\a147Well, that has to be considered. But he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. Curious, Watson\a151 very curious. But young Mr. Bennett is before his time if that is his ring. I had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came.\a148There was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door and a moment later the new client presented himself. He was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the self-possession of the man of the world. He shook hands with Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me.\a147This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147 Consider the relation in which I stand to Professor Presbury both privately and publicly. I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any third person.\a148\a147Have no fear, Mr. Bennett. Dr. Watson is the very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to need an assistant.\a148\a147As you like, Mr. Holmes. You will, I am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter.\a148\a147You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman, Mr. Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. Certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery.\a148\a147I hope so, Mr. Holmes. That is my one object. Does Dr. Watson know the situation?\a148\a147I have not had time to explain it.\a148\a147Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments.\a148\a147I will do so myself,\a148 said Holmes, \a147in order to show that I have the events in their due order. The professor, Watson, is a man of European reputation. His life has been academic. There has never been a breath of scandal. He is a widower with one daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. So the matter stood until a very few months ago.\a147Then the current of his life was broken. He is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the professor\a146s infatuation. None the less, it did not meet with full approval in his own family.\a148\a147We thought it rather excessive,\a148 said our visitor.\a147Exactly. Excessive and a little violent and unnatural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. The daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It was only age which stood in the way.\a147About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the professor\a146s life. He did what he had never done before. He left home and gave no indication where he was going. He was away a fortnight and returned looking rather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. It chanced, however, that our client here, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-student in Prague, who said that he was glad to have seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. Only in this way did his own household learn where he had been.\a147Now comes the point. From that time onward a curious change came over the professor. He became furtive and sly. Those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. His intellect was not affected. His lectures were as brilliant as ever. But always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. You, sir, as I understand, did the same\a151 but all was in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters.\a148\a147You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the professor had no secrets from me. If I were his son or his younger brother I could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. As his secretary I handled every paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly after his return all this was changed. He told me that certain letters might come to him from London which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. These were to be set aside for his own eyes only. I may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the E. C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.\a148\a147And the box,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Ah, yes, the box. The professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with Germany. This he placed in his instrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a canula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. It was the first time such a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt. I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that I had touched the box, but all the evening I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.\a148 Mr. Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. \a147That was on July 2d,\a148 said he.\a147You are certainly an admirable witness,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I may need some of these dates which you have noted.\a148\a147I learned method among other things from my great teacher. From the time that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my duty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it was on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the professor as he came from his study into the hall. Again, on July 11th, there was a scene of the same sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon July 20th. After that we had to banish Roy to the stables. He was a dear, affectionate animal\a151 but I fear I weary you.\a148Mr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that Holmes was not listening. His face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself.\a147Singular! Most singular!\a148 he murmured. \a147These details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? But you spoke of some fresh developments.\a148The pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. \a147What I speak of occurred the night before last,\a148 said he. \a147I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. I opened my door and peeped out. I should explain that the professor sleeps at the end of the passage\a151\a148\a147The date being?\a148 asked Holmes.Our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption.\a147I have said, sir, that it was the night before last\a151 that is, September 4th.\a148Holmes nodded and smiled.\a147Pray continue,\a148 said he.\a147He sleeps at the end of the passage and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. It was a really terrifying experience, Mr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I saw. The passage was dark save that one window halfway along it threw a patch of light. I could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. Then suddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. He was crawling, Mr. Holmes\a151 crawling! He was not quite on his hands and knees. I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. Yet he seemed to move with ease. I was so paralysed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was extraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. It must have been daylight before he regained his room.\a148\a147Well, Watson, what make you of that?\a148 asked Holmes with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen.\a147Lumbago, possibly. I have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.\a148\a147Good, Watson! You always keep us flat-footed on the ground. But we can hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment.\a148\a147He was never better in health,\a148 said Bennett. \a147In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for years. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wit\a146s end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. Edith\a151 Miss Presbury\a151 feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.\a148\a147It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. What do you think, Watson?\a148\a147Speaking as a medical man,\a148 said I, \a147it appears to be a case for an alienist. The old gentleman\a146s cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. His letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction\a151 a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box.\a148\a147And the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is more in it than this. Now, I can only suggest\a151\a148What Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at this moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room. As she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched.\a147Edith, dear! Nothing the matter, I hope?\a148\a147I felt I must follow you. Oh, Jack, I have been so dreadfully frightened! It is awful to be there alone.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of. This is my fianc\a233.\a148\a147We were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, Watson?\a148 Holmes answered with a smile. \a147I take it, Miss Presbury, that there is some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should know?\a148Our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional English type, smiled back at Holmes as she seated herself beside Mr. Bennett.\a147When I found Mr. Bennett had left his hotel I thought I should probably find him here. Of course, he had told me that he would consult you. But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my poor father?\a148\a147I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is still obscure. Perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it.\a148\a147It was last night, Mr. Holmes. He had been very strange all day. I am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does. He lives as in a strange dream. Yesterday was such a day. It was not my father with whom I lived. His outward shell was there, but it was not really he.\a148\a147Tell me what happened.\a148\a147I was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously. Poor Roy, he is chained now near the stable. I may say that I always sleep with my door locked; for, as Jack\a151 as Mr. Bennett\a151 will tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. My room is on the second floor. It happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was bright moonlight outside. As I lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my father\a146s face looking in at me. Mr. Holmes, I nearly died of surprise and horror. There it was pressed against the windowpane, and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window. If that window had opened, I think I should have gone mad. It was no delusion, Mr. Holmes. Don\a146t deceive yourself by thinking so. I dare say it was twenty seconds or so that I lay paralysed and watched the face. Then it vanished, but I could not\a151 I could not spring out of bed and look out after it. I lay cold and shivering till morning. At breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure of the night. Neither did I, but I gave an excuse for coming to town\a151 and here I am.\a148Holmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss Presbury\a146s narrative.\a147My dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor. Is there a long ladder in the garden?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, that is the amazing part of it. There is no possible way of reaching the window\a151 and yet he was there.\a148\a147The date being September 5th,\a148 said Holmes. \a147That certainly complicates matters.\a148It was the young lady\a146s turn to look surprised. \a147This is the second time that you have alluded to the date, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Bennett. \a147Is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case?\a148\a147It is possible\a151 very possible\a151 and yet I have not my full material at present.\a148\a147Possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon?\a148\a147No, I assure you. It was quite a different line of thought. Possibly you can leave your notebook with me, and I will check the dates. Now I think, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear. This young lady has informed us\a151 and I have the greatest confidence in her intuition\a151 that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates. We will therefore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date. He will put it down to his own lack of memory. Thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him.\a148\a147That is excellent,\a148 said Mr. Bennett. \a147I warn you, however, that the professor is irascible and violent at times.\a148Holmes smiled. \a147There are reasons why we should come at once\a151 very cogent reasons if my theories hold good. To-morrow, Mr. Bennett, will certainly see us in Camford. There is, if I remember right, an inn called the Chequers where the port used to be above mediocrity and the linen was above reproach. I think, Watson, that our lot for the next few days might lie in less pleasant places.\a148Monday morning found us on our way to the famous university town\a151 an easy effort on the part of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one which involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice was by this time not inconsiderable. Holmes made no allusion to the case until after we had deposited our suitcases at the ancient hostel of which he had spoken.\a147I think, Watson, that we can catch the professor just before lunch. He lectures at eleven and should have an interval at home.\a148\a147What possible excuse have we for calling?\a148Holmes glanced at his notebook.\a147There was a period of excitement upon August 26th. We will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times. If we insist that we are there by appointment I think he will hardly venture to contradict us. Have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?\a148\a147We can but try.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! Compound of the Busy Bee and Excelsior. We can but try\a151 the motto of the firm. A friendly native will surely guide us.\a148Such a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient colleges and, finally turning into a tree-lined drive, pulled up at the door of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple wistaria. Professor Presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not only of comfort but of luxury. Even as we pulled up, a grizzled head appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn glasses. A moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from London, was standing before us. There was certainly no sign of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, large-featured man, grave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a lecturer needs. His eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to the verge of cunning.He looked at our cards. \a147Pray sit down, gentlemen. What can I do for you?\a148Mr. Holmes smiled amiably.\a147It was the question which I was about to put to you, Professor.\a148\a147To me, sir!\a148\a147Possibly there is some mistake. I heard through a second person that Professor Presbury of Camford had need of my services.\a148\a147Oh, indeed!\a148 It seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in the intense grey eyes. \a147You heard that, did you? May I ask the name of your informant?\a148\a147I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was rather confidential. If I have made a mistake there is no harm done. I can only express my regret.\a148\a147Not at all. I should wish to go further into this matter. It interests me. Have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your assertion?\a148\a147No, I have not.\a148\a147I presume that you do not go so far as to assert that I summoned you?\a148\a147I would rather answer no questions,\a148 said Holmes.\a147No, I dare say not,\a148 said the professor with asperity. \a147 However, that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid.\a148He walked across the room to the bell. Our London friend Mr. Bennett, answered the call.\a147Come in, Mr. Bennett. These two gentlemen have come from London under the impression that they have been summoned. You handle all my correspondence. Have you a note of anything going to a person named Holmes?\a148\a147No, sir,\a148 Bennett answered with a flush.\a147That is conclusive,\a148 said the professor, glaring angrily at my companion. \a147Now, sir\a148he leaned forward with his two hands upon the table\a151\a148 it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion.\a148\a147Hardly enough, Mr. Holmes!\a148 the old man cried in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face. He got between us and the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious passion. \a147You can hardly get out of it so easily as that.\a148 His face was convulsed, and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage. I am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room if Mr. Bennett had not intervened.\a147My dear Professor,\a148 he cried, \a147consider your position! Consider the scandal at the university! Mr. Holmes is a well-known man. You cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy.\a148Sulkily our host\a151 if I may call him so\a151 cleared the path to the door. We were glad to find ourselves outside the house and in the quiet of the tree-lined drive. Holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode.\a147Our learned friend\a146s nerves are somewhat out of order,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that personal contact which I desired. But, dear me, Watson, he is surely at our heels. The villain still pursues us.\a148There were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief, not the formidable professor but his assistant who appeared round the curve of the drive. He came panting up to us.\a147I am so sorry, Mr. Holmes. I wished to apologise.\a148\a147My dear sir, there is no need. It is all in the way of professional experience.\a148\a147I have never seen him in a more dangerous mood. But he grows more sinister. You can understand now why his daughter and I are alarmed. And yet his mind is perfectly clear.\a148\a147Too clear!\a148 said Holmes. \a147That was my miscalculation. It is evident that his memory is much more reliable than I had thought. By the way, can we, before we go, see the window of Miss Presbury\a146s room?\a148Mr. Bennett pushed his way through some shrubs, and we had a view of the side of the house.\a147It is there. The second on the left.\a148\a147Dear me, it seems hardly accessible. And yet you will observe that there is a creeper below and a water-pipe above which give some foothold.\a148\a147I could not climb it myself,\a148 said Mr. Bennett.\a147Very likely. It would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man.\a148\a147There was one other thing I wish to tell you, Mr. Holmes. I have the address of the man in London to whom the professor writes. He seems to have written this morning, and I got it from his blotting-paper. It is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but what else can I do?\a148Holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket.\a147Dorak\a151 a curious name. Slavonic, I imagine. Well, it is an important link in the chain. We return to London this afternoon, Mr. Bennett. I see no good purpose to be served by our remaining. We cannot arrest the professor because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad. No action is as yet possible.\a148\a147Then what on earth are we to do?\a148\a147A little patience, Mr. Bennett. Things will soon develop. Unless I am mistaken, next Tuesday may mark a crisis. Certainly we shall be in Camford on that day. Meanwhile, the general position is undeniably unpleasant, and if Miss Presbury can prolong her visit \a148\a147That is easy.\a148\a147Then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past. Meanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him. So long as he is in a good humour all is well.\a148\a147There he is!\a148 said Bennett in a startled whisper. Looking between the branches we saw the tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door and look around him. He stood leaning forward, his hands swinging straight before him, his head turning from side to side. The secretary with a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed to be animated and even excited conversation.\a147I expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together,\a148 said Holmes as we walked hotel-ward. \a147He struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain from the little I saw of him. Explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it. I rather fancy that friend Bennett is in for an uncomfortable time.\a148H\tolmes stopped at a post-office and sent off a telegram on our way. The answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me.\tH\tave visited the Commercial Road and seen Dorak. Suave person, Bohemian, elderly. Keeps large general store.\tM\tERCER.\t\a147Mercer is since your time,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He is my general utility man who looks up routine business. It was important to know something of the man with whom our professor was so secretly corresponding. His nationality connects up with the Prague visit.\a148\a147Thank goodness that something connects with something,\a148 said I. \a147At present we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents with no bearing upon each other.\a147For example, what possible connection can there be between an angry wolfhound and a visit to Bohemia, or either of them with a man crawling down a passage at night? As to your dates, that is the biggest mystification of all.\a148Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. We were, I may say, seated in the old sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vintage of which Holmes had spoken on the table between us.\a147Well, now, let us take the dates first,\a148 said he, his fingertips together and his manner as if he were addressing a class. \a147This excellent young man\a146s diary shows that there was trouble upon July 2d, and from then onward it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as I remember, only one exception. Thus the last outbreak upon Friday was on September 3d, which also falls into the series, as did August 26th, which preceded it. The thing is beyond coincidence.\a148I was forced to agree.\a147Let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect. His naturally violent nature is intensified by it. He learned to take this drug while he was in Prague, and is now supplied with it by a Bohemian intermediary in London. This all hangs together, Watson!\a148\a147But the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?\a148\a147Well, well, we have made a beginning. I should not expect any fresh developments until next Tuesday. In the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend Bennett and enjoy the amenities of this charming town.\a148In the morning Mr. Bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report. As Holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him. Without exactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the professor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some strong grievance. This morning he was quite himself again, however, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded class. \a147Apart from his queer fits,\a148 said Bennett, \a147he has actually more energy and vitality than I can ever remember, nor was his brain ever clearer. But it\a146s not he\a151 it\a146s never the man whom we have known.\a148\a147I don\a146t think you have anything to fear now for a week at least,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147I am a busy man, and Dr. Watson has his patients to attend to. Let us agree that we meet here at this hour next Tuesday, and I shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles. Meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.\a148I saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following Monday evening I had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the train. From what he told me as we travelled up to Camford all was well, the peace of the professor\a146s house had been unruffled, and his own conduct perfectly normal. This also was the report which was given us by Mr. Bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our old quarters in the Chequers. \a147He heard from his London correspondent to-day. There was a letter and there was a small packet, each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them. There has been nothing else.\a148\a147That may prove quite enough,\a148 said Holmes grimly. \a147Now, Mr. Bennett, we shall, I think, come to some conclusion tonight. If my deductions are correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a head. In order to do so it is necessary to hold the professor under observation. I would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on the lookout. Should you hear him pass your door, do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly as you can. Dr. Watson and I will not be far off. By the way, where is the key of that little box of which you spoke?\a148\a147Upon his watch-chain.\a148\a147I fancy our researches must lie in that direction. At the worst the lock should not be very formidable. Have you any other able-bodied man on the premises?\a148\a147There is the coachman, Macphail.\a148\a147Where does he sleep?\a148\a147Over the stables.\a148\a147We might possibly want him. Well, we can do no more until we see how things develop, Good-bye\a151 but I expect that we shall see you before morning.\a148It was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes immediately opposite the hall door of the professor. It was a fine night, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to time the half-moon. It would have been a dismal vigil were it not for the expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the assurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the strange sequence of events which had engaged our attention.\a147If the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the professor at his worst to-night,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to Prague, that he is in secret correspondence with a Bohemian dealer in London, who presumably represents someone in Prague, and that he received a packet from him this very day, all point in one direction. What he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way from Prague is clear enough. He takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which attracted my attention. But his symptoms are most remarkable. Did you observe his knuckles?\a148I had to confess that I did not.\a147Thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience. Always look at the hands first, Watson. Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. Very curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of progression observed by\a151\a148 Holmes paused and suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead. \a147Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have been! It seems incredible, and yet it must be true. All points in one direction. How could I miss seeing the connection of ideas? Those knuckles how could I have passed those knuckles? And the dog! And the ivy! It\a146s surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of my dreams. Look out, Watson! Here he is! We shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves.\a148The hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamp-lit background we saw the tall figure of Professor Presbury. He was clad in his dressing gown. As he stood outlined in the doorway he was erect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last.Now he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came over him. He sank down into a crouching position and moved along upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were overflowing with energy and vitality. He moved along the face of the house and then round the corner. As he disappeared Bennett slipped through the hall door and softly followed him.\a147Come, Watson, come!\a148 cried Holmes, and we stole as softly as we could through the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the other side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the half-moon. The professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-covered wall. As we watched him he suddenly began with incredible agility to ascend it. From branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own powers, with no definite object in view. With his dressing-gown flapping on each side of him, he looked like some huge bat glued against the side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit wall. Presently he tired of this amusement, and, dropping from branch to branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the stables, creeping along in the same strange way as before. The wolfhound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever when it actually caught sight of its master. It was straining on its chain and quivering with eagerness and rage. The professor squatted down very deliberately just out of reach of the hound and began to provoke it in every possible way. He took handfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in the dog\a146s face, prodded him with a stick which he had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal\a146s fury, which was already beyond all control. In all our adventures I do not know that I have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive and still dignified figure crouching frog-like upon the ground and goading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which ramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated cruelty.And then in a moment it happened! It was not the chain that broke, but it was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked Newfoundland. We heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next instant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one roaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of terror. It was a very narrow thing for the professor\a146s life. The savage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two apart. It might have been a dangerous task for us, but Bennett\a146s voice and presence brought the great wolf-hound instantly to reason. The uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room above the stables. \a147I\a146m not surprised,\a148 said he, shaking his head. \a147I\a146ve seen him at it before. I knew the dog would get him sooner or later.\a148The hound was secured, and together we carried the professor up to his room, where Bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his torn throat. The sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid artery, and the haemorrhage was serious. In half an hour the danger was past, I had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk into deep sleep. Then, and only then, were we able to look at each other and to take stock of the situation.\a147I think a first-class surgeon should see him,\a148 said I.\a147For God\a146s sake, no!\a148 cried Bennett. \a147At present the scandal is confined to our own household. It is safe with us. If it gets beyond these walls it will never stop. Consider his position at the university, his European reputation, the feelings of his daughter.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand. The key from the watch-chain, Mr. Bennett. Macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change. Let us see what we can find in the professor\a146s mysterious box.\a148There was not much, but there was enough\a151 an empty phial, another nearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed, foreign hand. The marks on the envelopes showed that they were those which had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated from the Commercial Road and signed \a147A. Dorak.\a148 They were mere invoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to Professor Presbury, or receipt to acknowledge money. There was one other envelope, however, in a more educated hand and bearing the Austrian stamp with the postmark of Prague. \a147Here we have our material!\a148 cried Holmes as he tore out the enclosure.HONOURED COLLEAGUE [it ran]:Since your esteemed visit I have thought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are some special reasons for the treatment, I would none the less enjoin caution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a kind.It is possible that the serum of anthropoid would have been better. I have, as I explained to you, used black-faced langur because a specimen was accessible. Langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while anthropoid walks erect and is in all ways nearer.I beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature revelation of the process. I have one other client in England, and Dorak is my agent for both.Weekly reports will oblige.Yours with high esteem,H. LOWENSTEIN.Lowenstein! The name brought back to me the memory of some snippet from a newspaper which spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving in some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of life. Lowenstein of Prague! Lowenstein with the wondrous strength-giving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to reveal its source. In a few words I said what I remembered. Bennett had taken a manual of zoology from the shelves. \a147\a160\a145Langur.\a146 \a147 he read. \a147\a160\a145the great black-faced monkey of the Himalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climbing monkeys. Many details are added. Well, thanks to you, Mr. Holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source.\a148\a147The real source,\a148 said Holmes, \a147lies, of course, in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man. When one tries to rise above Nature one is liable to fall below it. The highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny.\a148 He sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand, looking at the clear liquid within. \a147When I have written to this man and told him that I hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he circulates, we will have no more trouble. But it may recur. Others may find a better way. There is danger there\a151 a very real danger to humanity. Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. The spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. It would be the survival of the least fit. What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?\a148 Suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and Holmes, the man of action, sprang from his chair. \a147I think there is nothing more to be said, Mr. Bennett. The various incidents will now fit themselves easily into the general scheme. The dog, of course, was aware of the change far more quickly than you. His smell would insure that. It was the monkey, not the professor, whom Roy attacked, just as it was the monkey who teased Roy. Climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was a mere chance, I take it, that the pastime brought him to the young lady\a146s window. There is an early train to town, Watson, but I think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the Chequers before we catch it.\a148\p\X1\BThe Sussex Vampire\B\X1\c\i\m="SUSS-04.png"\i\cHolmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me.\a147For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,\a148 said he. \a147What do you make of it, Watson?\a148I read as follows:46, OLD JEWRY,Nov. 19th.Re VampiresSIR:Our client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr. Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.We are, sir,Faithfully yours,MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD.per E. J. C.\a147Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,\a148 said Holmes in a reminiscent voice. \a147It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimms\a146 fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.\a148I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime.\a147Voyage of the Gloria Scott,\a148 he read. \a147That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, the forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can\a146t beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania.\a148 He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment.\a147Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It\a146s pure lunacy.\a148\a147But surely,\a148 said I, \a147the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read, for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.\a148\a147You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.\a148He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table while he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.\a147Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson?\a148\a147It is in Sussex, South of Horsham.\a148\a147Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman\a146s?\a148\a147I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley\a146s and Harvey\a146s and Carriton\a146s\a151 the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.\a148\a147Precisely,\a148 said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quietly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. \a147I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.\a148\a147With me!\a148\a147You had better read it.\a148H\te handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted.\tD\tEAR MR HOLMES [it said]:\tI\t have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have\a151 to all appearance absolutely devoted.\tN\tow for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.\tT\this was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.\tI\tt left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse\a146s mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child\a146s life and a man\a146s sanity may depend upon it.\tA\tt last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse\a146s nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. While they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery.\tI\tmagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child\a146s exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife\a146s face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she\a151 she beyond all question\a151 who had drunk the poor baby\a146s blood.\tS\to the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know, little of vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex\a151 well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o\a146clock.\tY\tours faithfully,\tR\tOBERT FERGUSON.\tP\t. S. I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give. \t\a147Of course I remembered him,\a148 said I as I laid down the letter. \a147Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It\a146s like him to be so concerned over a friend\a146s case.\a148Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.\a147I never get your limits, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. \a145Will examine your case with pleasure.\a146\a160\a148\a147Your case!\a148\a147We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.\a148Promptly at ten o\a146clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.\a147Hullo, Watson,\a148 said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. \a147You don\a146t look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it\a146s this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone\a146s deputy.\a148 .\a147It is simpler to deal direct,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God\a146s sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wit\a146s end.\a148\a147Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wit\a146s end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?\a148\a147We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name\a151 a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.\a148\a147Then the child is in no immediate danger?\a148\a147Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.\a148\a147But never wounded?\a148\a147No, she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.\a148 Ferguson\a146s gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. \a147You would think that the dear lad\a146s condition would soften anyone\a146s heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr. Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within.\a148Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. \a147What other inmates are there in your house, Mr. Ferguson?\a148\a147Two servants who have not been long with us. One stablehand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs. Mason. That is all.\a148\a147I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?\a148\a147I had only known her a few weeks.\a148\a147How long had this maid Dolores been with her?\a148\a147Some years.\a148\a147Then your wife\a146s character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?\a148\a147Yes, you may say so.\a148Holmes made a note.\a147I fancy,\a148 said he, \a147that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.\a148Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.\a147It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria if you could come.\a148\a147Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?\a148\a147That is so.\a148\a147But the assaults take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son.\a148\a147Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.\a148\a147Did she give no explanation why she struck him?\a148\a147None save that she hated him. Again and again she said so.\a148\a147Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature?\a148\a147Yes, she is very jealous\a151 jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.\a148\a147But the boy\a151 he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?\a148\a147No, he declared there was no reason.\a148\a147Were they good friends at other times?\a148\a147No, there was never any love between them.\a148\a147Yet you say he is affectionate?\a148\a147Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do.\a148Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought.\a147No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?\a148\a147Very much so.\a148\a147And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?\a148\a147Most devoted.\a148\a147He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?\a148\a147In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.\a148\a147That certainly complicates matters.\a148\a147I don\a146t quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o\a146clock.\a148It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.There was one very large central room into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought.\a147Hullo!\a148 he cried. \a147Hullo!\a148A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson\a146s hand.\a147What is it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147The dog. What\a146s the matter with it?\a148\a147That\a146s what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He\a146ll be all right soon\a151 won\a146t you, Carlo?\a148A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog\a146s mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case.\a147Did it come on suddenly?\a148\a147In a single night.\a148\a147How long ago?\a148\a147It may have been four months ago.\a148\a147Very remarkable. Very suggestive.\a148\a147What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147A confirmation of what I had already thought.\a148\a147For God\a146s sake, what do you think, Mr. Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer\a151 my child in constant danger! Don\a146t play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly serious.\a148The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm.\a147I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,\a148 said he. \a147I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.\a148\a147Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife\a146s room and see if there has been any change.\a148He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.\a147The tea is ready, Dolores,\a148 said Ferguson. \a147See that your mistress has everything she can wish.\a148\a147She verra ill,\a148 cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. \a147She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.\a148Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.\a147I should be so glad if I could be of use.\a148\a147Would your mistress see Dr. Watson?\a148\a147I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.\a148\a147Then I\a146ll come with you at once.\a148I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure.\a147She lie like that one day, two day. I \a146fraid she die,\a148 said the girl.The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.\a147Where is my husband?\a148\a147He is below and would wish to see you.\a148\a147I will not see him. I will not see him.\a148 Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. \a147A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?\a148\a147Can I help you in any way?\a148\a147No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.\a148The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil.\a147Madame,\a148 I said, \a147your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.\a148Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.\a147He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart? That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me\a151 he could speak of me so.\a148\a147He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.\a148\a147No, he cannot understand. But he should trust.\a148\a147Will you not see him?\a148 I suggested.\a147No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him.\a148 She turned her face to the wall and would say no more.I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.\a147How can I send her the child?\a148 he said. \a147How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips?\a148 He shuddered at the recollection. \a147The child is safe with Mrs. Mason, and there he must remain.\a148A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.\a147Oh, daddy,\a148 he cried, \a147I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!\a148Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment.\a147Dear old chap,\a148 said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. \a147I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.\a148\a147Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?\a148\a147Yes.\a148The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.\a147What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?\a148 asked Holmes. \a147Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?\a148\a147Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,\a148 said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly.\a147Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,\a148 he muttered as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention. Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.\a147Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.\a148He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: \a147Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.\a148 The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.\a147What is Mrs. Mason like?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.\a148\a147Do you like her, Jack?\a148 Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.\a147Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,\a148 said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. \a147Luckily I am one of his likes.\a148The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father\a146s breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him.\a147Run away, little Jacky,\a148 said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. \a147Now, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he continued when the boy was gone, \a147I really feel that I have brought you on a fool\a146s errand, for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.\a148\a147It is certainly delicate,\a148 said my friend with an amused smile, \a147but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.\a148Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.\a147For heaven\a146s sake, Holmes,\a148 he said hoarsely; \a147if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.\a148\a147Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?\a148\a147She is ill, but she is quite rational.\a148\a147Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.\a148\a147She will not see me,\a148 cried Ferguson.\a147Oh, yes, she will,\a148 said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper.\a147You at least have the entree, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?\a148I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out.\a147She will see them. She will leesten,\a148 said she.At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an armchair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.\a147I think we can dispense with Dolores,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.\a148Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.\a147Prove that, Mr. Holmes, and I am your debtor forever.\a148\a147I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.\a148\a147I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.\a148\a147Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child\a146s cot with the blood upon her lips.\a148\a147I did.\a148\a147Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?\a148\a147Poison!\a148\a147A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small birdbow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out.\a147And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understand him and he fitted into my reconstruction.\a147Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child\a146s life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.\a148\a147Jacky!\a148\a147I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.\a148\a147My Jacky!\a148\a147You have to face it, Mr. Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.\a148\a147Good God! It is incredible!\a148\a147Have I spoken the truth, madame?\a148The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband.\a147How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.\a148\a147I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,\a148 said Holmes, rising from his chair. \a147Only one thing is still clouded, madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There is a limit to a mother\a146s patience. But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?\a148\a147I had told Mrs. Mason. She knew.\a148\a147Exactly. So I imagined.\a148Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering.\a147This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,\a148 said Holmes in a whisper. \a147If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now,\a148 he added as he closed the door behind him, \a147I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.\a148I have only one further note of this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus:BAKER STREET,Nov. 21st.Re VampiresSIR:Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With thanks for your recommendation, I am, sir,Faithfully yours,SHERLOCK HOLMES.\p\X1\BThe Three Garridebs\B\X1\c\i\m="3GAR-04.png"\i\cIt may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. It cost one man his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law. Yet there was certainly an element of comedy. Well, you shall judge for yourselves.I remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. I only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position of partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion. I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix the date, which was the latter end of June, 1902, shortly after the conclusion of the South African War. Holmes had spent several days in bed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere gray eyes.\a147There is a chance for you to make some money, friend Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb?\a148I admitted that I had not.\a147Well, if you can lay your hand upon a Garrideb, there\a146s money in it.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s a long story\a151 rather a whimsical one, too. I don\a146t think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular. The fellow will be here presently for cross-examination, so I won\a146t open the matter up till he comes. But, meanwhile, that\a146s the name we want.\a148The telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and I turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest. But to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place. I gave a cry of triumph.\a147Here you are, Holmes! Here it is!\a148Holmes took the book from my hand.\a147\a160\a145Garrideb, N.,\a146 \a147 he read, \a147\a160\a145136 Little Ryder Street, W.\a146 Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Watson, but this is the man himself. That is the address upon his letter. We want another to match him.\a148Mrs. Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray. I took it up and glanced at it.\a147Why, here it is!\a148 I cried in amazement. \a147This is a different initial. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, Moorville, Kansas, U. S. A. \a148Holmes smiled as he looked at the card. \a147I am afraid you must make yet another effort, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147This gentleman is also in the plot already, though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning. However, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to know.\a148A moment later he was in the room. Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face characteristic of so many American men of affairs. The general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face. His eyes, however, were arresting. Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so responsive to every change of thought. His accent was American, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech.\a147Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked, glancing from one to the other. \a147Ah, yes! Your pictures are not unlike you, sir, if I may say so. I believe you have had a letter from my namesake, Mr. Nathan Garrideb, have you not?\a148\a147Pray sit down,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147We shall, I fancy, have a good deal to discuss.\a148 He took up his sheets of foolscap. \a147You are, of course, the Mr. John Garrideb mentioned in this document. But surely you have been in England some time?\a148\a147Why do you say that, Mr. Holmes?\a148 I seemed to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes.\a147Your whole outfit is English.\a148Mr. Garrideb forced a laugh. \a147I\a146ve read of your tricks, Mr. Holmes, but I never thought I would be the subject of them. Where do you read that?\a148\a147The shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your boots\a151 could anyone doubt it?\a148\a147Well, well, I had no idea I was so obvious a Britisher. But business brought me over here some time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is nearly all London. However, I guess your time is of value, and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks. What about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand?\a148Holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor, whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable expression.\a147Patience! Patience, Mr. Garrideb!\a148 said my friend in a soothing voice. \a147Dr. Watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter. But why did Mr. Nathan Garrideb not come with you?\a148\a147Why did he ever drag you into it at all?\a148 asked our visitor with a sudden outflame of anger. \a147What in thunder had you to do with it? Here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and one of them must needs call in a detective! I saw him this morning, and he told me this fool-trick he had played me, and that\a146s why I am here. But I feel bad about it, all the same.\a148\a147There was no reflection upon you, Mr. Garrideb. It was simply zeal upon his part to gain your end\a151 an end which is, I understand, equally vital for both of you. He knew that I had means of getting information, and, therefore, it was very natural that he should apply to me.\a148Our visitor\a146s angry face gradually cleared.\a147Well, that puts it different,\a148 said he. \a147When I went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective, I just asked for your address and came right away. I don\a146t want police butting into a private matter. But if you are content just to help us find the man, there can be no harm in that.\a148\a147Well, that is just how it stands,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, sir, since you are here, we had best have a clear account from your own lips. My friend here knows nothing of the details.\a148Mr. Garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze.\a147Need he know?\a148 he asked.\a147We usually work together.\a148\a147Well, there\a146s no reason it should be kept a secret. I\a146ll give you the facts as short as I can make them. If you came from Kansas I would not need to explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Garrideb was. He made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at Chicago, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your counties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge. It\a146s grazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-land, and just every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it.\a147He had no kith nor kin\a151 or, if he had, I never heard of it. But he took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. That was what brought us together. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another man with his own name. It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find out if there were any more Garridebs in the world. \a145Find me another!\a146 said he. I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking round the world in search of Garridebs. \a145None the less,\a146 said he, \a145that is just what you will do if things pan out as I planned them.\a146 I thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words, as I was soon to discover.\a147For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind him. It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State of Kansas. His property was divided into three parts and I was to have one on condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the remainder. It\a146s five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we can\a146t lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.\a147It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I set forth looking for Garridebs. There is not one in the United States. I went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the old country. Sure enough there was the name in the London telephone directory. I went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. But he is a lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. It says three adult men in the will. So you see we still have a vacancy, and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges.\a148\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said Holmes with a smile, \a147I said it was rather whimsical, did I not? I should have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers.\a148\a147I have done that, Mr. Holmes. No replies.\a148\a147Dear me! Well, it is certainly a most curious little problem. I may take a glance at it in my leisure. By the way, it is curious that you should have come from Topeka. I used to have a correspondent\a151 he is dead now\a151 old Dr. Lysander Starr, who was mayor in 1890.\a148\a147Good old Dr. Starr!\a148 said our visitor. \a147His name is still honoured. Well, Mr. Holmes, I suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress. I reckon you will hear within a day or two.\a148 With this assurance our American bowed and departed.Holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some time with a curious smile upon his face.\a147Well?\a148 I asked at last.\a147I am wondering, Watson\a151 just wondering!\a148\a147At what?\a148Holmes took his pipe from his lips.\a147I was wondering, Watson, what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies. I nearly asked him so\a151 for there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy\a151 but I judged it better to let him think he had fooled us. Here is a man with an English coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a year\a146s wear, and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial American lately landed in London. There have been no advertisements in the agony columns. You know that I miss nothing there. They are my favourite covert for putting up a bird, and I would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. I never knew a Dr. Lysander Starr, of Topeka. Touch him where you would he was false. I think the fellow is really an American, but he has worn his accent smooth with years of London. What is his game, then, and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for Garridebs? It\a146s worth our attention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is certainly a complex and ingenious one. We must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also. Just ring him up, Watson.\a148I did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at the other end of the line.\a147Yes, yes, I am Mr. Nathan Garrideb. Is Mr. Holmes there? I should very much like to have a word with Mr. Holmes.\a148My friend took the instrument and I heard the usual syncopated dialogue.\a147Yes, he has been here. I understand that you don\a146t know him\a148... How long? ... Only two days! ... Yes, yes, of course, it is a most captivating prospect. Will you be at home this evening? I suppose your namesake will not be there?\a160.\a160.\a160. Very good, we will come then, for I would rather have a chat without him\a148... Dr. Watson will come with me\a148... I understand from your note that you did not go out often\a148... Well, we shall be round about six. You need not mention it to the American lawyer\a148... Very good. Good-bye!\a148It was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and even Little Ryder Street, one of the smaller offshoots from the Edgware Road, within a stone-cast of old Tyburn Tree of evil memory, looked golden and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun. The particular house to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, Early Georgian edifice, with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay windows on the ground floor. It was on this ground floor that our client lived, and, indeed, the low windows proved to be the front of the huge room in which he spent his waking hours. Holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name.\a147Up some years, Watson,\a148 he remarked, indicating its discoloured surface. \a147It\a146s his real name, anyhow, and that is something to note.\a148The house had a common stair, and there were a number of names painted in the hall, some indicating offices and some private chambers. It was not a collection of residential flats, but rather the abode of Bohemian bachelors. Our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at four o\a146clock. Mr. Nathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald, some sixty-odd years of age. He had a cadaverous face, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown. Large round spectacles and a small projecting goat\a146s beard combined with his stooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity. The general effect, however, was amiable, though eccentric.The room was as curious as its occupant. It looked like a small museum. It was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical. Cases of butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance. A large table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among them. As I glanced round I was surprised at the universality of the man\a146s interests. Here was a case of ancient coins. There was a cabinet of flint instruments. Behind his central table was a large cupboard of fossil bones. Above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as \a147Neanderthal,\a148 \a147 Heidelberg,\a148 \a147Cro-Magnon\a148 printed beneath them. It was clear that he was a student of many subjects. As he stood in front of us now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which he was polishing a coin.\a147Syracusan\a151 of the best period,\a148 he explained, holding it up. \a147They degenerated greatly towards the end. At their best I hold them supreme, though some prefer the Alexandrian school. You will find a chair here, Mr. Holmes. Pray allow me to clear these bones. And you, sir\a151 ah, yes, Dr. Watson\a151 if you would have the goodness to put the Japanese vase to one side. You see round me my little interests in life. My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I go out when I have so much to hold me here? I can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months.\a148Holmes looked round him with curiosity.\a147But do you tell me that you never go out?\a148 he said.\a147Now and again I drive down to Sotheby\a146s or Christie\a146s. Otherwise I very seldom leave my room. I am not too strong, and my researches are very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific shock\a151 pleasant but terrific\a151 it was for me when I heard of this unparalleled good fortune. It only needs one more Garrideb to complete the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a brother, but he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. But there must surely be others in the world. I had heard that you handled strange cases, and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this American gentleman is quite right, and I should have taken his advice first, but I acted for the best.\a148\a147I think you acted very wisely indeed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But are you really anxious to acquire an estate in America?\a148\a147Certainly not, sir. Nothing would induce me to leave my collection. But this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim. Five million dollars was the sum named. There are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. Just think what I could do with five million dollars. Why, I have the nucleus of a national collection. I shall be the Hans Sloane of my age.\a148His eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles. It was very clear that no pains would be spared by Mr. Nathan Garrideb in finding a namesake.\a147I merely called to make your acquaintance, and there is no reason why I should interrupt your studies,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom I do business. There are few questions I need ask, for I have your very clear narrative in my pocket, and I filled up the blanks when this American gentleman called. I understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence.\a148\a147That is so. He called last Tuesday.\a148\a147Did he tell you of our interview to-day?\a148\a147Yes, he came straight back to me. He had been very angry.\a148\a147Why should he be angry?\a148\a147He seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour. But he was quite cheerful again when he returned.\a148\a147Did he suggest any course of action?\a148\a147No, sir, he did not.\a148\a147Has he had, or asked for, any money from you?\a148\a147No, sir, never!\a148\a147You see no possible object he has in view?\a148\a147None, except what he states.\a148\a147Did you tell him of our telephone appointment?\a148\a147Yes, sir, I did.\a148Holmes was lost in thought. I could see that he was puzzled.\a147Have you any articles of great value in your collection?\a148\a147No, sir. I am not a rich man. It is a good collection, but not a very valuable one.\a148\a147You have no fear of burglars?\a148\a147Not the least.\a148\a147How long have you been in these rooms?\a148\a147Nearly five years.\a148Holmes\a146s cross-examination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at the door. No sooner had our client unlatched it than the American lawyer burst excitedly into the room.\a147Here you are!\a148 he cried, waving a paper over his head. \a147I thought I should be in time to get you. Mr. Nathan Garrideb, my congratulations! You are a rich man, sir. Our business is happily finished and all is well. As to you, Mr. Holmes, we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble.\a148H\te handed over the paper to our client, who stood staring at a marked advertisement. Holmes and I leaned forward and read it over his shoulder. This is how it ran:HOWARD GARRIDEBCONSTRUCTOR OF ACRICULTURAL MACHINERYBinders, reapers, steam and hand plows, drills, harrows, farmer\a146s carts, buckboards, and all other appliances.Estimates for Artesian WellsApply Grosvenor Buildings, Aston\t\a147Glorious!\a148 gasped our host. \a147That makes our third man.\a148\a147I had opened up inquiries in Birmingham,\a148 said the American, \a147and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper. We must hustle and put the thing through. I have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office to-morrow afternoon at four o\a146clock.\a148\a147You want me to see him?\a148\a147What do you say, Mr. Holmes? Don\a146t you think it would be wiser? Here am I, a wandering American with a wonderful tale. Why should he believe what I tell him? But you are a Britisher with solid references, and he is bound to take notice of what you say. I would go with you if you wished, but I have a very busy day to-morrow, and I could always follow you if you are in any trouble.\a148\a147Well, I have not made such a journey for years.\a148\a147It is nothing, Mr. Garrideb. I have figured out our connections. You leave at twelve and should be there soon after two. Then you can be back the same night. All you have to do is to see this man, explain the matter, and get an affidavit of his existence. By the Lord!\a148 he added hotly, \a147considering I\a146ve come all the way from the centre of America, it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think what this gentleman says is very true.\a148Mr. Nathan Garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air. \a147Well, if you insist I shall go,\a148 said he. \a147It is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything, considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life.\a148\a147Then that is agreed,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can.\a148\a147I\a146ll see to that,\a148 said the American. \a147Well,\a148 he added looking at his watch, \a147I\a146ll have to get on. I\a146ll call to-morrow, Mr. Nathan, and see you off to Birmingham. Coming my way, Mr. Holmes? Well, then, good-bye, and we may have good news for you to-morrow night.\a148I noticed that my friend\a146s face cleared when the American left the room, and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished.\a147I wish I could look over your collection, Mr. Garrideb,\a148 said he. \a147In my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of yours is a storehouse of it.\a148Our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big glasses.\a147I had always heard, sir, that you were a very intelligent man,\a148 said he. \a147I could take you round now if you have the time.\a148\a147Unfortunately, I have not. But these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation. If I should be able to look in to-morrow, I presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them?\a148\a147None at all. You are most welcome. The place will, of course, be shut up, but Mrs. Saunders is in the basement up to four o\a146clock and would let you in with her key.\a148\a147Well, I happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon. If you would say a word to Mrs. Saunders it would be quite in order. By the way, who is your house-agent?\a148Our client was amazed at the sudden question.\a147Holloway and Steele, in the Edgware Road. But why?\a148\a147I am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147I was wondering if this was Queen Anne or Georgian.\a148\a147Georgian, beyond doubt.\a148\a147Really. I should have thought a little earlier. However, it is easily ascertained. Well, good-bye, Mr. Garrideb, and may you have every success in your Birmingham journey.\a148The house-agent\a146s was close by, but we found that it was closed for the day, so we made our way back to Baker Street. It was not till after dinner that Holmes reverted to the subject.\a147Our little problem draws to a close,\a148 said he. \a147No doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind.\a148\a147I can make neither head nor tail of it.\a148\a147The head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to-morrow. Did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement?\a148\a147I saw that the word \a145plough\a146 was misspelt.\a148\a147Oh, you did notice that, did you? Come, Watson, you improve all the time. Yes, it was bad English but good American. The printer had set it up as received. Then the buckboards. That is American also. And artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. It was a typical American advertisement, but purporting to be from an English firm. What do you make of that?\a148\a147I can only suppose that this American lawyer put it in himself. What his object was I fail to understand.\a148\a147Well, there are alternative explanations. Anyhow, he wanted to get this good old fossil up to Birmingham. That is very clear. I might have told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose chase, but, on second thoughts, it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go. To-morrow, Watson\a151 well, to-morrow will speak for itself.\a148Holmes was up and out early. When he returned at lunchtime I noticed that his face was very grave.\a147This is a more serious matter than I had expected, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It is fair to tell you so, though I know it will only be an additional reason to you for running your head into danger. I should know my Watson by now. But there is danger, and you should know it.\a148\a147Well, it is not the first we have shared, Holmes. I hope it may not be the last. What is the particular danger this time?\a148\a147We are up against a very hard case. I have identified Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law. He is none other than \a145Killer\a146 Evans, of sinister and murderous reputation.\a148\a147I fear I am none the wiser.\a148\a147Ah, it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable Newgate Calendar in your memory. I have been down to see friend Lestrade at the Yard. There may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there, but they lead the world for thoroughness and method. I had an idea that we might get on the track of our American friend in their records. Sure enough, I found his chubby face smiling up at me from the rogues\a146 portrait gallery. \a145James Winter, alias Morecroft, alias Killer Evans,\a146 was the inscription below.\a148 Holmes drew an envelope from his pocket. \a147I scribbled down a few points from his dossier: Aged forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot three men in the States. Escaped from penitentiary through political influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot a man over cards in a night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead man was identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in Chicago. Killer Evans released in 1901. Has been under police supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. Very dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. That is our bird, Watson\a151 a sporting bird, as you must admit.\a148\a147But what is his game?\a148\a147Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to the houseagent\a146s. Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. It was unlet for a year before then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at large named Waldron. Waldron\a146s appearance was well remembered at the office. He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him. He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. Now, Prescott, the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard, a tall, dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis, I think we may take it that Prescott, the American criminal, used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at last we get a link, you see.\a148\a147And the next link?\a148\a147Well, we must go now and look for that.\a148He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\a147I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild West friend tries to live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. I\a146ll give you an hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our Ryder Street adventure.\a148It was just four o\a146clock when we reached the curious apartment of Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a spring lock, and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left. Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house. Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. There was one cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. It was behind this that we eventually crouched while Holmes in a whisper outlined his intentions.\a147He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room\a151 that is very clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to do it. The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no other end. I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him an opening which he could hardly have expected. He wove his plot with remarkable cunning.\a146\a146\a147But what did he want?\a148\a147Well, that is what we are here to find out. It has nothing whatever to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. It is something connected with the man he murdered\a151 the man who may have been his confederate in crime. There is some guilty secret in the room. That is how I read it. At first I thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knew\a151 something worth the attention of a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring.\a148That hour was not long in striking. We crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp, metallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room. He closed the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do and how to do it. He pushed the table to one side, tore up the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back, and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and worked vigorously upon the floor. Presently we heard the sound of sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the planks. Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view.Clearly our moment had come. Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and together we stole across to the open trap-door. Gently as we moved, however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head of our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the open space. His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage, which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pistols were pointed at his head.\a147Well, well!\a148 said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface. \a147I guess you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. Well, sir, I hand it to you; you have me beat and\a151\a148In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired two shots. I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes\a146s pistol came down on the man\a146s head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for weapons. Then my friend\a146s wiry arms were round me, and he was leading me to a chair.\a147You\a146re not hurt, Watson? For God\a146s sake, say that you are not hurt!\a148It was worth a wound\a151 it was worth many wounds\a151 to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.\a147It\a146s nothing, Holmes. It\a146s a mere scratch.\a148He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.\a147You are right,\a148 he cried with an immense sigh of relief. \a147It is quite superficial.\a148 His face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. \a147By the Lord, it is as well for you. If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out of this room alive. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\a148He had nothing to say for himself. He only sat and scowled. I leaned on Holmes\a146s arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar which had been disclosed by the secret flap. It was still illuminated by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. Our eyes fell upon a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat little bundles.\a147A printing press\a151 a counterfeiter\a146s outfit,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Yes, sir,\a148 said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then sinking into the chair. \a147The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw. That\a146s Prescott\a146s machine, and those bundles on the table are two thousand of Prescott\a146s notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere. Help yourselves, gentlemen. Call it a deal and let me beat it.\a148Holmes laughed.\a147We don\a146t do things like that, Mr. Evans. There is no bolthole for you in this country. You shot this man Prescott, did you not?\a148\a147Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on me. Five years\a151 when I should have had a medal the size of a soup plate. No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England, and if I hadn\a146t put him out he would have flooded London with them. I was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. Can you wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that when I found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if I had put him away. It would have been easy enough, but I\a146m a soft-hearted guy that can\a146t begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? I\a146ve not used this plant. I\a146ve not hurt this old stiff. Where do you get me?\a148\a147Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But that\a146s not our job. They take that at the next stage. What we wanted at present was just your sweet self. Please give the Yard a call, Watson. It won\a146t be entirely unexpected.\a148So those were the facts about Killer Evans and his remarkable invention of the three Garridebs. We heard later that our poor old friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams. When his castle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins. He was last heard of at a nursing-home in Brixton. It was a glad day at the Yard when the Prescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew that it existed, they had never been able, after the death of the man, to find out where it was. Evans had indeed done great service and caused several worthy C. I. D. men to sleep the sounder, for the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger. They would willingly have subscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the criminal had spoken, but an unappreciative bench took a less favourable view, and the Killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged.\p\X1\BThe Illustrious Client\B\X1\c\i\m="illu-05.png"\i\c\a147It can\a146t hurt now,\a148 was Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a146s comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend\a146s career.Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish bath. It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. I had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him.\a147It may be some fussy, self-important fool; it may be a matter of life or death,\a148 said he as he handed me the note. \a147I know no more than this message tells me.\a148I\tt was from the Carlton Club and dated the evening before. This is what I read:\tS\tir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and will call upon him at 4:30 to-morrow. Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr. Holmes is very delicate and also very important. He trusts, therefore, that Mr. Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the Carlton Club. \t\a147I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson,\a148 said Holmes as I returned the paper. \a147Do you know anything of this man Damery?\a148\a147Only that this name is a household word in society.\a148\a147Well, I can tell you a little more than that. He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance.\a148\a147Our?\a148\a147Well, if you will be so good, Watson.\a148\a147I shall be honoured.\a148\a147Then you have the hour4:30. Until then we can put the matter out of our heads.\a148I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time, but I was round at Baker Street before the time named. Sharp to the half-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. It is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, cleanshaven face, and, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. The big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room.\a147Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson,\a148 he remarked with a courteous bow. \a147His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. I should say that there is no more dangerous man in Europe.\a148\a147I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied,\a148 said Holmes with a smile. \a147Don\a146t you smoke? Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. May I ask his name?\a148\a147Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?\a148\a147You mean the Austrian murderer?\a148Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. \a147There is no getting past you, Mr. Holmes! Wonderful! So you have already sized him up as a murderer?\a148\a147It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime. Who could possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the man\a146s guilt! It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! I am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called \a145accident\a146 happened in the Splugen Pass as if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he had come to England and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again?\a148\a147No, it is more serious than that. To revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. Can a human being be placed in a more trying position?\a148\a147Perhaps not.\a148\a147Then you will sympathise with the client in whose interests I am acting.\a148\a147I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. Who is the principal?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question. It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. His motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial?\a148\a147I am sorry,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. I fear, Sir James, that I must decline to act.\a148Our visitor was greatly disturbed. His large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment.\a147You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147You place me in a most serious dilemma for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. May I, at least, lay all that I can before you?\a148\a147By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing.\a148\a147That is understood. In the first place, you have no doubt heard of General de Merville?\a148\a147De Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard of him.\a148\a147He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend.\a148\a147Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?\a148\a147The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned\a151 the hold of love. The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.\a148\a147But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville?\a148\a147It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. The company, though select, paid their own passages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron\a146s true character until it was too late. The villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. To say that she loves him hardly expresses it. She dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She will not hear one word against him. Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her.\a148\a147Does she know about the Austrian episode?\a148\a147The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other.\a148\a147Dear me! But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? It is no doubt General de Merville.\a148Our visitor fidgeted in his chair.\a147I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes, but it would not be true. De Merville is a broken man. The strong soldier has been utterly demoralised by this incident. He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this Austrian. My client however is an old friend, one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act. It was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito.\a148Holmes gave a whimsical smile.\a147I think I may safely promise that,\a148 said he. \a147I may add that your problem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep in touch with you?\a148\a147The Carlton Club will find me. But in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, \a145XX.31.\a146\a160\a148Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee.\a147The Baron\a146s present address, please?\a148\a147Vernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large house. He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist.\a148\a147Is he at home at present?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man?\a148\a147He has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier. For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham, but then this Prague affair got noised about and he had to leave. He collects books and pictures. He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature. He is, I believe, a recognised authority upon Chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject.\a148\a147A complex mind,\a148 said Holmes. \a147All great criminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean artist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James, you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I have some sources of information of my own, and I dare say we may find some means of opening the matter up.\a148When our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. At last, however, he came briskly back to earth.\a147Well, Watson, any views?\a148 he asked.\a147I should think you had better see the young lady herself.\a148\a147My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail? And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. But I think we must begin from a different angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help.\a148I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend\a146s career . During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of London and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. Had Johnson been a \a147nark\a148 of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. With the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the entree of every night-club, doss house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn.It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by appointment that evening at Simpson\a146s, where, sitting at a small table in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand, he told me something of what had passed.\a147Johnson is on the prowl,\a148 said he. \a147He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man\a146s secrets.\a148\a147But if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?\a148\a147Who knows, Watson? Woman\a146s heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner remarked to me\a151\a148\a147He remarked to you!\a148\a147Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans. Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with my man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. When I had given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable mood.\a148\a147Did he recognise you?\a148\a147There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card. He is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. He has breeding in him\a151 a real aristocrat of crime with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. Yes, I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner.\a148\a147You say he was affable?\a148\a147A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. Some people\a146s affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. His greeting was characteristic. \a145I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he. \a145You have been engaged, no doubt by General de Merville, to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, Violet. That is so, is it not?\a146I acquiesced.\a147\a160\a145My dear man,\a146 said he. \a145you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. You will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is curious,\a146 I answered, \a145but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you. I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man. No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. It is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made England too hot to hold you. Is the game worth it? Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice.\a146\a147The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. These quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle.\a147\a160\a145Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, \a145but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. I don\a146t think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic all the same. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small.\a146\a147\a160\a145So you think.\a146\a147\a160\a145So I know. Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons\a151 I hope you recognise yourself\a151 would come to her and tell her these things, and I warned her how to treat them. You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion. Mr. Holmes \a145 Well you will see how it works for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father\a146s will\a151 save only in the one little matter.\a146\a147Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me.\a147\a160\a145By the way, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, \a145did you know Le Brun, the French agent?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Do you know what befell him?\a146\a147\a160\a145I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite true, Mr. Holmes. By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. Don\a146t do it, Mr. Holmes; it\a146s not a lucky thing to do. Several have found that out. My last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. Good-bye!\a146\a147So there you are, Watson. You are up to date now.\a148\a147The fellow seems dangerous.\a148\a147Mighty dangerous. I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means.\a148\a147Must you interfere? Does it really matter if he marries the girl?\a148\a147Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say it mattered very much. Besides, the client! Well, well, we need not discuss that. When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report.\a148We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her.\a147This is Miss Kitty Winter,\a148 said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. \a147What she don\a146t know\a151 well, there, she\a146ll speak for herself. Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within an hour of your message.\a148\a147I\a146m easy to find,\a148 said the young woman. \a147Hell, London, gets me every time. Same address for Porky Shinwell. We\a146re old mates, Porky, you and I. But, by cripes! there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! That is the man you are after, Mr. Holmes.\a148Holmes smiled. \a147I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter.\a148\a147If I can help to put him where he belongs, I\a146m yours to the rattle,\a148 said our visitor with fierce energy. There was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain.\a147You needn\a146t go into my past, Mr. Holmes. That\a146s neither here nor there. But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me. If I could pull him down!\a148 She clutched frantically with her hands into the air. \a147Oh, if I could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many!\a148\a147You know how the matter stands?\a148\a147Porky Shinwell has been telling me. He\a146s after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. You want to stop it. Well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him.\a148\a147She is not in her senses. She is madly in love. She has been told all about him. She cares nothing.\a148\a147Told about the murder?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147My Lord, she must have a nerve!\a148\a147She puts them all down as slanders.\a148\a147Couldn\a146t you lay proofs before her silly eyes?\a148\a147Well, can you help us do so?\a148\a147Ain\a146t I a proof myself? If I stood before her and told her how he used me\a151\a148\a147Would you do this?\a148\a147Would I? Would I not!\a148\a147Well, it might be worth trying. But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the question.\a148\a147I\a146ll lay he didn\a146t tell her all,\a148 said Miss Winter. \a147I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: \a145He died within a month.\a146 It wasn\a146t hot air, either. But I took little notice\a151 you see, I loved him myself at that time. Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! There was just one thing that shook me. Yes, by cripes! if it had not been for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes. I\a146d have left him that very night. It\a146s a book he has\a151 a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. I think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me.\a148\a147What was it, then?\a148\a147I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. He had it all in that book. Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. It was a beastly book\a151 a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. But it was Adelbert Gruner\a146s book all the same. \a145Souls I have ruined.\a146 He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. However, that\a146s neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can\a146t get it.\a148\a147Where is it?\a148\a147How can I tell you where it is now? It\a146s more than a year since I left him. I know where he kept it then. He\a146s a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. Do you know his house?\a148\a147I\a146ve been in the study,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Have you, though? You haven\a146t been slow on the job if you only started this morning. Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time. The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it\a151 big glass cupboard between the windows. Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study\a151 a small room where he keeps papers and things.\a148\a147Is he not afraid of burglars?\a148\a147Adelbert is no coward. His worst enemy couldn\a146t say that of him. He can look after himself. There\a146s a burglar alarm at night. Besides, what is there for a burglar\a151 unless they got away with all this fancy crockery?\a148\a147No good,\a148 said Shinwell Johnson with the decided voice of the expert. \a147No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call here tomorrow evening at five. I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. I am exceedingly obliged to you for your cooperation. I need not say that my clients will consider liberally\a151\a148\a147None of that, Mr. Holmes,\a148 cried the young woman. \a147I am not out for money. Let me see this man in the mud, and I\a146ve got all I\a146ve worked for\a151 in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. That\a146s my price. I\a146m with you tomorrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. Porky here can tell you always where to find me.\a148I did not see Holmes again until the following evening when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant. He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview. Then he told the story, which I would repeat in this way. His hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life.\a147There was no difficulty at all about the appointment,\a148 said Holmes, \a147for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. The General phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old soldier resides\a151 one of those awful grey London castles which would make a church seem frivolous. A footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain.\a147I don\a146t quite know how to make her clear to you, Watson. Perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages. How a beastman could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine. You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. You never saw a worse case than this.\a147She knew what we had come for, of course\a151 that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. Miss Winter\a146s advent rather amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. If your head is inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de Merville.\a147\a160\a145Well, sir,\a146 said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, \a145your name is familiar to me. You have called, as I understand, to malign my \ifianc\a233\i, Baron Gruner. It is only by my father\a146s request that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.\a146\a147I was sorry for her, Watson. I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own. I am not often eloquent. I use my head, not my heart. But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature. I pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man\a146s character after she is his wife\a151 a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. I spared her nothing\a151 the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies.\a147\a160\a145I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said she. \a145The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. I am aware that Adelbert, that my \ifianc\a233\i, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. Possibly you mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him. But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. I am not clear\a146, here she turned eyes upon my companion, \a145who this young lady may be.\a146\a147I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. If ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women.\a147\a160\a145I\a146ll tell you who I am,\a146 she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion\a151\a145I am his last mistress. I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that\a146s the best. I tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he\a146ll be the death of you. It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he\a146ll have you one way or the other. It\a146s not out of love for you I\a146m speaking. I don\a146t care a tinker\a146s curse whether you live or die. It\a146s out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. But it\a146s all the same, and you needn\a146t look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should prefer not to discuss such matters,\a146 said Miss de Merville coldly. \a145Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my \ifianc\a233\a146s\i life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done.\a146\a147\a160\a145Three passages!\a146 screamed my companion. \a145You fool! You unutterable fool!\a146\a147\a160\a145Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end,\a146 said the icy voice. \a145I have obeyed my father\a146s wish in seeing you, but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.\a146\a147With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. I dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. So now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won\a146t work. I\a146ll keep in touch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us.\a148And it did. Their blow fell\a151 or his blow rather, for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it. I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-vender displayed his evening papers. The date was just two days after the last conversation. There, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet:\c\iMURDEROUS ATTACK UPONSHERLOCK HOLMES\i\cI\t think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist\a146s shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph. This was how it ran:\tW\te learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. There are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o\a146clock in Regent Street, outside the Cafe Royal. The attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and Mr. Holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. He was carried to Charing Cross Hospital and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in Baker Street. The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Cafe Royal and out into Glasshouse Street behind it. No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man.\tI need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street. I found Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall and his brougham waiting at the curb.\a147No immediate danger,\a148 was his report. \a147Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden.\a148With this permission I stole into the darkened room. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. I sat beside him and bent my head.\a147All right, Watson. Don\a146t look so scared,\a148 he muttered in a very weak voice. \a147It\a146s not as bad as it seems.\a148\a147Thank God for that!\a148\a147I\a146m a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. I took most of them on my guard. It was the second man that was too much for me.\a148\a147What can I do, Holmes? Of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. I\a146ll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word.\a148\a147Good old Watson! No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. But their get-away had been well prepared. We may be sure of that. Wait a little. I have my plans. The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. They\a146ll come to you for news. Put it on thick, Watson. Lucky if I live the week out concussion delirium\a151 what you like! You can\a146t overdo it.\a148\a147But Sir Leslie Oakshott?\a148\a147Oh, he\a146s all right. He shall see the worst side of me. I\a146ll look after that.\a148\a147Anything else?\a148\a147Yes. Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way. Those beauties will be after her now. They know, of course, that she was with me in the case. If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. That is urgent. Do it to-night.\a148\a147I\a146ll go now. Anything more?\a148\a147Put my pipe on the table\a151 and the tobacco-slipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign.\a148I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past.For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death. The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended even to me. There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap between.On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat \iRuritania\i, starting from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard.\a147Friday!\a148 he cried. \a147Only three clear days. I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger\a146s way. But he won\a146t, Watson! By the Lord Harry, he won\a146t! Now, Watson, I want you to do something for me.\a148\a147I am here to be used, Holmes.\a148\a147Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.\a148He gave no explanations and I asked for none. By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience. But when I had left his room I walked down Baker Street, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order. Finally I drove to the London Library in St. James\a146s Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sublibrarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm.It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. And yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning, I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening. He was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite armchair.\a147Why, Holmes,\a148 I said, \a147if one believed the papers, you are dying. \a148\a147That,\a148 said he, \a147is the very impression which I intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you learned your lessons?\a148\a147At least I have tried to.\a148\a147Good. You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?\a148\a147I believe I could.\a148\a147Then hand me that little box from the mantelpiece.\a148He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk. This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour.\a147It needs careful handling, Watson. This is the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty. No finer piece ever passed through Christie\a146s. A complete set of this would be worth a king\a146s ransom\a151 in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of Peking. The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild.\a148\a147What am I to do with it?\a148Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: \a147Dr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street.\a148\a147That is your name for the evening, Watson. You will call upon Baron Gruner. I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china. You may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. You are a collector this set has come your way, you have heard of the Baron\a146s interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price.\a148\a147What price?\a148\a147Well asked, Watson. You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client. You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world.\a148\a147I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! You scintillate to-day. Suggest Christie or Sotheby. Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself.\a148\a147But if he won\a146t see me?\a148\a147Oh, yes, he will see you. He has the collection mania in its most acute form\a151 and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the letter. No answer needed. You will merely say that you are coming, and why.\a148It was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. A district messenger was duly dispatched with it. On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr. Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure.The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of considerable wealth. A long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. The place had been built by a South African gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. A butler, who would have adorned a bench of bishops, showed me in and handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ushered me into the Baron\a146s presence.He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows and which contained part of his Chinese collection. He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand.\a147Pray sit down, Doctor,\a148 said he. \a147I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them. This little Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke?\a148I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and I was able to study them at my ease.He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. His European reputation for beauty was fully deserved. In figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. His hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer\a146s mouth it was there\a151 a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was Nature\a146s danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. His voice was engaging and his manners perfect. In age I should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two.\a147Very fine\a151 very fine indeed!\a148 he said at last. \a147And you say you have a set of six to correspond. What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. I only know of one in England to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained this?\a148\a147Does it really matter?\a148 I asked with as careless an air as I could muster.\a147You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content to take an expert\a146s valuation.\a148\a147Very mysterious,\a148 said he with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark eyes. \a147In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. That the piece is genuine is certain. I have no doubts at all about that. But suppose\a151 I am bound to take every possibility into account\a151 that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell?\a148\a147I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort.\a148\a147That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth.\a148\a147My bankers would answer that.\a148\a147Quite so. And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual.\a148\a147You can do business or not,\a148 said I with indifference. \a147I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters.\a148\a147Who told you I was a connoisseur?\a148\a147I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject.\a148\a147Have you read the book?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. How do you explain that?\a148\a147I am a very busy man. I am a doctor in practice.\a148\a147That is no answer. If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. You said in your note that you were a connoisseur.\a148\a147So I am.\a148\a147Might I ask you a few questions to test you? I am obliged to tell you, Doctor\a151 if you are indeed a doctor\a151 that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara? Dear me, does that puzzle you? Tell me a little about the Nonhern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics.\a148I sprang from my chair in simulated anger.\a147This is intolerable, sir,\a148 said I. \a147I came here to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy. My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way.\a148He looked at me steadily. The languor had gone from his eyes. They suddenly glared. There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips.\a147What is the game? You are here as a spy. You are an emissary of Holmes. This is a trick that you are playing upon me. The fellow is dying I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. You\a146ve made your way in here without leave, and, by God! you may find it harder to get out than to get in.\a148He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. He may have suspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth; but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him. He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. Then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently.\a147Ah!\a148 he cried. \a147Ah!\a148 and dashed into the room behind him.Two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. The window leading out to the garden was wide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window.And then! It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it. An arm\a151 a woman\a146s arm\a151 shot out from among the leaves. At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry\a151 a yell which will always ring in my memory. He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. Then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house.\a147Water! For God\a146s sake, water!\a148 was his cry.I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye was already white and glazed. The other was red and inflamed. The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible.In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. \a147It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!\a148 he cried. \a147Oh, the she-devil! She shall pay for it! She shall pay! Oh, God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!\a148I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which glazed up at me. I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. An inspector of police had also arrived, and to him I handed my real card. It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom and terror. Within an hour I was at Baker Street.Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron\a146s transformation.\a147The wages of sin, Watson\a151 the wages of sin!\a148 said he. \a147Sooner or later it will always come. God knows, there was sin enough,\a148 he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. \a147Here is the book the woman talked of. If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. But it will, Watson. It must. No self-respecting woman could stand it.\a148\a147It is his love diary?\a148\a147Or his lust diary. Call it what you will. The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it. I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. But I brooded over it. Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. That was all to the good. I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to America forced my hand. He would never have left so compromising a document behind him. Therefore we had to act at once. Burglary at night is impossible. He takes precautions. But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged. That was where you and your blue saucer came in. But I had to be sure of the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery. Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment. How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? I thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own.\a148\a147He guessed I came from you.\a148\a147I feared he would. But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape. Ah, Sir James, I am very glad you have come!\a148Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes\a146s account of what had occurred.\a147You have done wonders\a151 wonders!\a148 he cried when he had heard the narrative. \a147But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr. Watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book.\a148Holmes shook his head.\a147Women of the De Merville type do not act like that. She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. No, no. It is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. That book will bring her back to earth\a151 and I know nothing else that could. It is in his own writing. She cannot get past it.\a148Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer. As I was myself overdue, I went down with him into the street. A brougham was waiting for him. He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, and drove swiftly away. He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. I gasped with surprise. Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes\a146s room.\a147I have found out who our client is,\a148 I cried, bursting with my great news. \a147Why, Holmes, it is\a151\a148\a147It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,\a148 said Holmes, holding up a restraining hand. \a147Let that now and forever be enough for us.\a148I do not know how the incriminating book was used. Sir James may have managed it. Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady\a146s father. The effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired.Three days later appeared a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place. The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic. My friend has not yet stood in the dock.\p\X1\BThe Three Gables\B\X1\c\i\m="3GAB-01.png"\i\cI don\a146t think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn low armchair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer impression of what occurred.The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.\a147Which of you gen\a146l\a146men is Masser Holmes?\a148 he asked.Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.\a147Oh! it\a146s you, is it?\a148 said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. \a147See here, Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks\a146 business. Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser Holmes?\a148\a147Keep on talking,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It\a146s fine.\a148\a147Oh! it\a146s fine, is it?\a148 growled the savage. \a147It won\a146t be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I\a146ve handled your kind before now, and they didn\a146t look fine when I was through with them. Look at that, Masser Holmes!\a148He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend\a146s nose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.\a147Were you born so?\a148 he asked. \a147Or did it come by degrees?\a148It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In any case, our visitor\a146s manner became less flamboyant.\a147Well, I\a146ve given you fair warnin\a146,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146ve a friend that\a146s interested out Harrow way\a151 you know what I\a146m meaning\a151 and he don\a146t intend to have no buttin\a146 in by you. Got that? You ain\a146t the law, and I ain\a146t the law either, and if you come in I\a146ll be on hand also. Don\a146t you forget it.\a148\a147I\a146ve wanted to meet you for some time,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I won\a146t ask you to sit down, for I don\a146t like the smell of you, but aren\a146t you Steve Dixie, the bruiser?\a148\a147That\a146s my name, Masser Holmes, and you\a146ll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip.\a148\a147It is certainly the last thing you need,\a148 said Holmes, staring at our visitor\a146s hideous mouth. \a147But it was the killing of young Perkins outside the Holborn\a151 Bar What! you\a146re not going?\a148The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. \a147I won\a146t listen to no such talk,\a148 said he. \a147What have I to do with this \a146ere Perkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin\a146 at the Bull Ring in Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble.\a148\a147Yes, you\a146ll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I\a146ve been watching you and Barney Stockdale\a151\a148\a147So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes\a151\a148\a147That\a146s enough. Get out of it. I\a146ll pick you up when I want you.\a148\a147Good-mornin\a146, Masser Holmes. I hope there ain\a146t no hard feelin\a146s about this \a146ere visit?\a148\a147There will be unless you tell me who sent you.\a148\a147Why, there ain\a146t no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was that same gen\a146l\a146man that you have just done gone mention.\a148\a147And who set him on to it?\a148\a147S\a146elp me. I don\a146t know, Masser Holmes. He just say, \a145Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain\a146t safe if he go down Harrow way.\a146 That\a146s the whole truth.\a148 Without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered. Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.\a147I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson. I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have time. His immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. They specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. What I want to know is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion?\a148\a147But why do they want to intimidate you?\a148\a147It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone\a146s while to take so much trouble, there must be something in it.\a148\a147But what is it?\a148\a147\tI was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude. Here is Mrs. Maberley\a146s note. If you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once.\a148\tD\tEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES [I read]:\tI\t have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house, and I should much value your advice. You would find me at home any time to-morrow. The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station. I believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one of your early clients.\tY\tours faithfully, MARY MABERLEY. \tThe address was \a147The Three Gables, Harrow Weald.\a148\a147So that\a146s that!\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, if you can spare the time, Watson, we will get upon our way.\a148A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and culture.\a147I remember your husband well, madam,\a148 said Holmes, \a147though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter.\a148\a147Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas.\a148Holmes looked at her with great interest.\a147Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? I knew him slightly. But of course all London knew him. What a magnificent creature he was! Where is he now?\a148\a147Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attach\a200 at Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last month.\a148\a147I am sorry. One could not connect death with such a man. I have never known anyone so vitally alive. He lived intensely\a151 every fibre of him!\a148\a147Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin of him. You remember him as he was\a151 debonair and splendid. You did not see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he developed. His heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man.\a148\a147A love affair\a151 a woman?\a148\a147Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you to come, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Dr. Watson and I are at your service.\a148\a147There have been some very strange happenings. I have been in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He said that this house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I would part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me very strange as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested in what he said. I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my life.\a147Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out. Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in Harrow. He said to me, \a145This is a very strange document. Are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything out of the house\a151 not even your own private possessions?\a146 When the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture.\a147\a160\a145No, no, everything,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145But my clothes? My jewels?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked. My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then it must be nothing,\a146 said I. And there the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought\a151\a148Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly struggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn, squawking, out of its coop.\a147Leave me alone! What are you a-doin\a146 of?\a148 she screeched.\a147Why, Susan, what is this?\a148\a147Well, ma\a146am, I was comin\a146 in to ask if the visitors was stayin\a146 for lunch when this man jumped out at me.\a148\a147I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little wheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that kind of work.\a148Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. \a147Who be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin\a146 me about like this?\a148\a147It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\a148\a147Who posted your letter?\a148\a147Susan did.\a148\a147Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me?\a148\a147It\a146s a lie. I sent no message.\a148\a147Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know. It\a146s a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell?\a148\a147Susan!\a148 cried her mistress, \a147I believe you are a bad, treacherous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.\a148\a147That was my own business,\a148 said the woman sullenly.\a147Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?\a148\a147I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney.\a148\a147Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world.\a148\a147So, a rich man? No; you smiled\a151 a rich woman. Now we have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner.\a148\a147I\a146ll see you in hell first.\a148\a147Oh, Susan! Language!\a148\a147I am clearing out of here. I\a146ve had enough of you all. I\a146ll send for my box to-morrow.\a148 She flounced for the door.\a147Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff\a148... Now,\a148 he continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, \a147this gang means business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter to me had the 10 P.M. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions; he or she\a151 I incline to the latter from Susan\a146s grin when she thought I had blundered\a151 forms a plan. Black Steve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o\a146clock next morning. That\a146s quick work, you know.\a148\a147But what do they want?\a148\a147Yes, that\a146s the question. Who had the house before you?\a148\a147A retired sea captain called Ferguson.\a148\a147Anything remarkable about him?\a148\a147Not that ever I heard of.\a148\a147I was wondering whether he could have buried something. Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your furniture? You don\a146t happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it?\a148\a147No, I don\a146t think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby tea-set.\a148\a147That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why should they not openly state what they want? If they covet your tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something which you do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you did know.\a148\a147That is how I read it,\a148 said I.\a147Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\a148\a147Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point. You have been in this house a year.\a148\a147Nearly two.\a148\a147All the better. During this long period no one wants anything from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands. What would you gather from that?\a148\a147It can only mean,\a148 said I, \a147that the object, whatever it may be, has only just come into the house.\a148\a147Settled once again,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, Mrs. Maberley has any object just arrived?\a148\a147No, I have bought nothing new this year.\a148\a147Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is that lawyer of yours a capable man?\a148\a147Mr. Sutro is most capable.\a148\a147Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged your front door alone?\a148\a147I have a young girl.\a148\a147Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You might possibly want protection.\a148\a147Against whom?\a148\a147Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can\a146t find what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give any address?\a148\a147Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and Valuer.\a148\a147I don\a146t think we shall find him in the directory. Honest business men don\a146t conceal their place of business. Well, you will let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through.\a148As we passed through the hall Holmes\a146s eyes, which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in a corner. The labels shone out upon them.\a147\a160\a145Milano.\a146 \a145Lucerne.\a146 These are from Italy.\a148\a147They are poor Douglas\a146s things.\a148\a147You have not unpacked them? How long have you had them?\a148\a147They arrived last week.\a148\a147But you said\a151 why, surely this might be the missing link. How do we know that there is not something of value there?\a148\a147There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?\a148Holmes was lost in thought.\a147Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\a148 he said at last. \a147Have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain. I will come tomorrow and hear your report.\a148It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket.\a147Lookin\a146 for your gun, Masser Holmes?\a148\a147No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.\a148\a147You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain\a146t you?\a148\a147It won\a146t be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave you fair warning this morning.\a148\a147Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I don\a146t want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins. S\a146pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.\a148\a147Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job.\a148\a147So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before. I don\a146t know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that\a146s all.\a148\a147Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don\a146t forget it.\a148\a147All right, Masser Holmes. I\a146ll remember.\a148\a147I\a146ve got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson,\a148 Holmes remarked as we walked on. \a147I think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be clearer in the matter.\a148I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St. James\a146s Street club and was the receiving-station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the metropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far down in the turbid depths of London life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn.W\then I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the following telegram.\tP\tlease come out at once. Client\a146s house burgled in the night. Police in possession.\tS\tUTRO. \tHolmes whistled. \a147The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald.\a148We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day. A small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds. Within we met a gray old gentleman, who introduced himself as the lawyer together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who greeted Hoimes as an old friend.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I\a146m afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply.\a148\a147I am sure the case is in very good hands,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Merely a common burglary, you say?\a148\a147Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it\a151 they\a146ve been seen about here.\a148\a147Excellent! What did they get?\a148\a147Well, they don\a146t seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was chloroformed and the house was\a151 Ah! here is the lady herself.\a148Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maidservant.\a147You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said she, smiling ruefully. \a147Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so I was unprotected.\a148\a147I only heard of it this morning,\a148 the lawyer explained.\a147Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I neglected his advice, and I have paid for it.\a148\a147You look wretchedly ill,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred.\a148\a147It is all here,\a148 said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.\a147Still, if the lady is not too exhausted\a151\a148\a147There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known the house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son\a146s baggage, which was partially opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I sprang up and seized him.\a148\a147You took a big risk,\a148 said the inspector.\a147I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the police, but the rascals had got away.\a148\a147What did they take?\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t think there is anything of value missing. I am sure there was nothing in my son\a146s trunks.\a148\a147Did the men leave no clue?\a148\a147There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It is in my son\a146s handwriting.\a148\a147Which means that it is not of much use,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Now if it had been in the burglar\a146s\a151\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes. \a147What rugged common sense! None the less, I should be curious to see it.\a148The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocketbook.\a147I never pass anything, however trifling,\a148 said he with some pomposity. \a147That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-five years\a146 experience I have learned my lesson. There is always the chance of finger-marks or something.\a148Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.\a147What do you make of it, Inspector?\a148\a147Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can see.\a148\a147It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You have noticed the number on the top of the page. It is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages?\a148\a147Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do them!\a148\a147It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?\a148\a147Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they got.\a148\a147Why should they go to my son\a146s things?\a148 asked Mrs. Maberley.\a147Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147\tI must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Watson.\a148 Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:\t\a147\t.\a160.\a160.\a160face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humiliation. She smiled\a151 yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge.\a148 \t\a147Queer grammar!\a148 said Holmes with a smile as he handed the paper back to the inspector. \a147Did you notice how the \a145he\a146 suddenly changed to \a145my\a146? The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero.\a148\a147It seemed mighty poor stuff,\a148 said the inspector as he replaced it in his book. \a147What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I don\a146t think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you wished to travel?\a148\a147It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Where would you like to go\a151 Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\a148\a147Oh if I had the money I would go round the world.\a148\a147Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-morning. I may drop you a line in the evening.\a148 As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the inspector\a146s smile and shake of the head. \a147These clever fellows have always a touch of madness.\a148 That was what I read in the inspector\a146s smile.\a147Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\a148 said Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London once more. \a147I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein.\a148We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly.\a147By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?\a148\a147No, I can\a146t say that I do. I only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief.\a148\a147Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you? She was, of course, \ithe\i celebrated beauty. There was never a woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in London, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an adventure with him. He was not a society butterfly but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. But she is the \i\a145belle dame sans merci\a146\i of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter can\a146t take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him.\a148\a147Then that was his own story\a151\a148\a147Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son. His Grace\a146s ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a different matter, so it is imperative\a151 Ah! here we are.\a148It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home. \a147Then we shall wait until she is,\a148 said Holmes cheerfully.The machine broke down.\a147Not at home means not at home to you,\a148 said the footman.\a147Good,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147That means that we shall not have to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress.\a148He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the man.\a147What did you say, Holmes?\a148 I asked.\a147I simply wrote: \a145Shall it be the police, then?\a146 I think that should pass us in.\a148It did\a151 with amazing celerity. A minute later we were in an Arabian Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. The lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half light more welcome. She rose from a settee as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at us both.\a147What is this intrusion\a151 and this insulting message?\a148 she asked, holding up the slip of paper.\a147I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for your intelligence to do so\a151 though I confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late.\a148\a147How so, sir?\a148\a147By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work. Surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him. It was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of young Maberley.\a148\a147I have no idea what you are talking about. What have I to do with hired bullies?\a148Holmes turned away wearily.\a147Yes, I have underrated your intelligence. Well, good-afternoon!\a148\a147Stop! Where are you going?\a148\a147To Scotland Yard.\a148We had not got halfway to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm. She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet.\a147Come and sit down, gentlemen. Let us talk this matter over. I feel that I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. You have the feelings of a gentleman. How quick a woman\a146s instinct is to find it out. I will treat you as a friend.\a148\a147I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. I am ready to listen, and then I will tell you how I will act.\a148\a147No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself.\a148\a147What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away.\a148\a147No, no! I am not so simple. Since I have promised to be frank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. As to them, well, it is not the first\a151\a148 She smiled and nodded with a charming coquettish intimacy.\a147I see. You\a146ve tested them before.\a148\a147They are good hounds who run silent.\a148\a147Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them. They will be arrested for this burglary. The police are already after them.\a148\a147They will take what comes to them. That is what they are paid for. I shall not appear in the matter.\a148\a147Unless I bring you into it.\a148\a147No, no, you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a woman\a146s secret.\a148\a147In the first place, you must give back this manuscript.\a148She broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace. There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker. \a147Shall I give this back?\a148 she asked. So roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all Holmes\a146s criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment.\a147That seals your fate,\a148 he said coldly. \a147You are very prompt in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion.\a148She threw the poker down with a clatter.\a147How hard you are!\a148 she cried. \a147May I tell you the whole story?\a148\a147I fancy I could tell it to you.\a148\a147But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes. You must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life\a146s ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. Is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself?\a148\a147The original sin was yours.\a148\a147Yes, yes! I admit it. He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans. He wanted marriage\a151 marriage, Mr. Holmes\a151 with a penniless commoner. Nothing less would serve him. Then he became pertinacious. Because I had given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him only. It was intolerable. At last I had to make him realize it.\a148\a147By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window.\a148\a147You do indeed seem to know everything. Well, it is true. Barney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little rough in doing so. But what did he do then? Could I have believed that a gentleman would do such an act? He wrote a book in which he described his own story. I, of course, was the wolf; he the lamb. It was all there, under different names, of course; but who in all London would have failed to recognize it? What do you say to that, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, he was within his rights.\a148\a147It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel Italian spirit. He wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation. There were two copies, he said\a151 one for me, one for his publisher.\a148\a147How did you know the publisher\a146s had not reached him?\a148\a147I knew who his publisher was. It is not his only novel, you know. I found out that he had not heard from Italy. Then came Douglas\a146s sudden death. So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me. Of course, it must be among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. I set the gang at work. One of them got into the house as servant. I wanted to do the thing honestly. I really and truly did. I was ready to buy the house and everything in it. I offered any price she cared to ask. I only tried the other way when everything else had failed. Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was too hard on Douglas\a151 and, God knows, I am sorry for it!what else could I do with my whole future at stake?\a148Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147Well, well,\a148 said he, \a147I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as usual. How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style?\a148The lady stared in amazement.\a147Could it be done on five thousand pounds?\a148\a147Well, I should think so, indeed!\a148\a147Very good. I think you will sign me a cheque for that, and I will see that it comes to Mrs. Maberley. You owe her a little change of air. Meantime, lady\a148he wagged a cautionary forefinger\a147have a care! Have a care! You can\a146t play with edged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands.\a148\p\X1\BThe Blanched Soldier\B\X1\c\i\m="BLAN-03.png"\i\cThe ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. \a147Try it yourself, Holmes!\a148 he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate.I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone.It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.\a147From South Africa, sir, I perceive.\a148\a147Yes, sir,\a148 he answered, with some surprise.\a147Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147Middlesex Corps, no doubt.\a148\a147That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.\a148I smiled at his bewildered expression.\a147When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?\a148\a147You see everything.\a148\a147I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes\a151!\a148\a147My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.\a148\a147Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out\a151\a148\a147Kicked you out!\a148\a147Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn\a146t have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey\a146s sake.\a148I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.\a147Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.\a148My client grinned mischievously.\a147I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,\a148 said he. \a147But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I\a146ve been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become.\a147When I joined up in January, 1901just two years ago\a151 young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth\a146s only son\a151 Emsworth the Crimean V. C.and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship\a151 the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate\a151 and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside-Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a word\a151 not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.\a147Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all.\a147I wasn\a146t satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn\a146t satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years\a146 absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey\a146s case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.\a148Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.\a147Well, what have you done?\a148 I asked.\a147My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore\a151 I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father\a151 and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday.\a147Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible\a151 five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey\a146s nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also\a151 a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred.\a147We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture\a146s beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.\a147\a160\a145Well, sir,\a146 said he in a rasping voice, \a145I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.\a146\a147I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.\a147\a160\a145Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.\a146\a147\a160\a145I have his letters to me in my pocket.\a146\a147\a160\a145Kindly let me see them.\a146\a147He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.\a147\a160\a145Well, what then?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly,\a146 I answered. \a145But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.\a146\a147My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it.\a147\a160\a145Many people, Mr. Dodd,\a146 said he, \a145would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.\a146\a147\a160\a145You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.\a146\a147\a160\a145Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey\a146s past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.\a146\a147So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend\a146s fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one\a146s quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.\a147\a160\a145I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.\a146\a147He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.\a147\a160\a145Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It\a146s natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?\a146\a147\a160\a145There was no braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.\a146\a147The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There\a146s not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy\a151 and oh, sir, he was a fine man.\a146\a147I sprang to my feet.\a147\a160\a145Look here!\a146 I cried. \a145You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?\a146\a147I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.\a147\a160\a145I don\a146t know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.\a146\a147He was leaving the room, but I held his arm\a147\a160\a145Listen,\a146 I said. \a145You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?\a148\a147He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotised The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.\a147\a160\a145I wish to God he was!\a146 he cried, and, tearing himself free he dashed from the room.\a147You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man\a146s words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.\a148My client had paused as one in deep emotion.\a147Pray continue,\a148 I said. \a147Your problem presents some very unusual features.\a148\a147He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale\a151 never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness.\a147There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn\a146t merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that\a151 something slinking, something furtive, something guilty\a151 something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind.\a147But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken.\a147It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain.\a147There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.\a147The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.\a147There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size\a151 large enough for a gardener\a146s or a gamekeeper\a146s residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat\a151 not at all the gardener type\a151 came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face.\a147\a160\a145Are you a visitor here?\a146 he asked.\a147I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey\a146s.\a147\a160\a145What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,\a146 I continued.\a147\a160\a145Quite so. Exactly,\a146 said he with a rather guilty air. \a145No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.\a146 He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.\a147I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.\a147I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.\a148\a147What paper?\a148 I asked.My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.\a147Can it matter?\a148 he asked.\a147It is most essential.\a148\a147I really took no notice.\a148\a147Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.\a148\a147Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the Spectator. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.\a147\a160\a145This way, sir!\a146 said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-table in the hall.\a147 There is a train to London at 8:30,\a146 said he. \a145The trap will be at the door at eight.\a146\a147He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.\a147\a160\a145The matter will not bear discussion,\a146 said he abruptly. \a145You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.\a146\a147At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.\a147\a160\a145I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.\a146\a147The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.\a148Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions.\a147The servants,\a148 I asked; \a147how many were in the house?\a148\a147To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.\a148\a147There was no servant, then, in the detached house?\a148\a147None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.\a148\a147That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?\a148\a147Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.\a148\a147Did you make any local inquiries?\a148\a147Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.\a148\a147You said nothing of your suspicions?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.\a148\a147To-day?\a148It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements.\a147This is an old friend,\a148 said I to Dodd. \a147It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.\a148The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear.\a147You say that you saw your friend\a146s face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?\a148\a147I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.\a148\a147It could not have been someone resembling him?\a148\a147No, no, it was he.\a148\a147But you say he was changed?\a148\a147Only in colour. His face was\a151 how shall I describe it?it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.\a148\a147Was it equally pale all over?\a148\a147I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.\a148\a147Did you call to him?\a148\a147I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.\a148My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales.Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph\a146s message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments.\a147Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I\a146ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,\a148 turning upon me, \a147I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.\a148\a147I cannot leave here,\a148 said my client firmly, \a147until I hear from Godfrey\a146s own lips that he is under no restraint.\a148Our involuntary host rang the bell.\a147Ralph,\a148 he said, \a147telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 said I. \a147You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognise that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.\a148\a147I am not so easily altered,\a148 said the old soldier. \a147Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!\a148\a147Nothing of the sort,\a148 I said, putting my back to the door. \a147Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.\a148 I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. \a147That,\a148 said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, \a147is what has brought us here.\a148He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished.\a147How do you know?\a148 he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.\a147It is my business to know things. That is my trade.\a148He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation.\a147Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.\a148At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face.\a147This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,\a148 said he. \a147This will disarrange all our plans.\a148\a147I can\a146t help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?\a148\a147Yes, he is waiting inside.\a148 He turned and led us into a large plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand.\a147Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!\a148But the other waved him back.\a147Don\a146t touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don\a146t quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?\a148His appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.\a147That\a146s why I don\a146t court visitors,\a148 said he. \a147I don\a146t mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.\a148\a147I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.\a148\a147Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn\a146t help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.\a148\a147But what in heaven\a146s name is the matter?\a148\a147Well, it\a146s not a long story to tell,\a148 said he, lighting a cigarette. \a147You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit?\a148\a147Yes, I heard that but I never got particulars.\a148\a147Three of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson\a151 the fellow we called Baldy Simpson\a151 and Anderson, and I. We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle.\a147When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep.\a147It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. The African sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. In front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not one of them was a normal human being. Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear.\a147It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry, and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don\a146t know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub; He said a few stern words in Dutch, and my persecutor shrank away. Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement.\a147\a160\a145How in the world did you come here?\a146 he asked in amazement. \a145Wait a bit! I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I\a146ll soon have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper\a146s bed.\a146\a147Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria.\a147So there you have my tragedy. I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. What was I to do? I was in this lonely house. We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. There was a house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy, Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one\a151 segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet countryside there would have been an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie\a151 even you had to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented I cannot imagine.\a148Colonel Emsworth pointed to me.\a147This is the gentleman who forced my hand.\a148 He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word \a147Leprosy.\a148 \a147It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.\a148\a147And so it was,\a148 said I. \a147Who knows but good may come of it? I understand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient. May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?\a148\a147I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,\a148 he observed with some stiffness.\a147I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient.\a148\a147That is so,\a148 said Colonel Emsworth.\a147I foresaw this situation,\a148 I explained, \a147and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His name is Sir James Saunders.\a148The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr. Kent.\a147I shall indeed be proud,\a148 he murmured.\a147Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations.\a148And here it is that I miss my Watson. By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematised common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey\a146s mother in the study of Colonel Emsworth.\a147That process,\a148 said I, \a147starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. We will now apply this principle to the case in point. As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father\a146s mansion. There was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. I could think of no other adequate solutions. These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other.\a147The criminal solution would not bear inspection. No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. I was sure of that. If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct.\a147Insanity was more plausible. The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. You will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading. Had it been the Lancet or the British Medical Journal it would have helped me. It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts.\a147There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. Leprosy is not uncommon in South Africa. By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. The case was a strong one\a151 so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.\a148I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand.\a147It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good,\a148 said he. \a147This occasion is the more welcome. It is not leprosy.\a148\a147What?\a148\a147A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scalelike affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly noninfective. Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation\a151 But the lady has fainted! I think that Mr. Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.\a148\p\X1\BThe Lion\a146s Mane\B\X1\c\i\m="LION-01.png"\i\cIt is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as abstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement, and be brought, as it were, to my very door. It occurred after my withdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of London. At this period of my life the good Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end visit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I must act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty! As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion\a146s Mane.My villa is situated upon the southern slope of the downs, commanding a great view of the Channel. At this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery. At the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full. Here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow. This admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point where the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line.My house is lonely. I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst\a146s well-known coaching establishment, The Gables, quite a large place, which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions, with a staff of several masters. Stackhurst himself was a well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar. He and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation.Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind blowing up-channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide. On the morning of which I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh. It was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. As I walked I heard a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting.\a147What a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I should see you out.\a148\a147Going for a swim, I see.\a148\a147At your old tricks again,\a148 he laughed, patting his bulging pocket. \a147Yes. McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.\a148Fitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever. He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him. Summer and winter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have often joined him.At this moment we saw the man himself. His head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends. Then his whole figure appeared at the top, staggering like a drunken man. The next instant he threw up his hands and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face. Stackhurst and I rushed forward\a151 it may have been fifty yards\a151 and turned him on his back. He was obviously dying. Those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else. One glimmer of life came into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning. They were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were \a147the Lion\a146s Mane.\a148 It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and yet I could twist the sound into no other sense. Then he half raised himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air, and fell forward on his side. He was dead.My companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had every sense on the alert. And I had need, for it was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary case. The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes. As he fell over, his Burberry, which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. We stared at it in amazement. His back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his shoulders and ribs. There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony. His drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been.I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell across us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side. Murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend. He seemed to live in some high abstract region of surds and conic sections, with little to connect him with ordinary life. He was looked upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face but also in occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as ferocious. On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the plate-glass window, an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher. Such was the strange complex man who now appeared beside us. He seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself.\a147Poor fellow! Poor fellow! What can I do? How can I help?\a148\a147Were you with him? Can you tell us what has happened?\a148\a147No, no, I was late this morning. I was not on the beach at all. I have come straight from The Gables. What can I do?\a148\a147You can hurry to the police-station at Fulworth. Report the matter at once.\a148Without a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the matter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body. My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach. From the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of Fulworth. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path. There was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the same footstep, both ascending and descending. No one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning. At one place I observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline. This could only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. There were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once. At the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide. At the side of it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock. It was folded and dry, so that it would seem that, after all, he had never entered the water. Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard shingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen. The latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so.And here was the problem clearly defined\a151 as strange a one as had ever confronted me. The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter of an hour at the most. Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables, so there could be no doubt about that. He had gone to bathe and had stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. Then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again\a151 they were all dishevelled and unfastened\a151 and he had returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself. And the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die. Who had done this barbarous deed? There were, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment. Then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach. They seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them, lapping up to the rocks. On the sea two or three fishing boats were at no great distance. Their occupants might be examined at our leisure. There were several roads for inquiry, but none which led to any very obvious goal.When I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of wondering folk had gathered round it. Stackhurst was, of course, still there, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid Sussex breed\a151 a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior. He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and finally drew me aside.\a147I\a146d be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes. This is a big thing for me to handle, and I\a146ll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong.\a148I\t advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor; also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made, until they came. In the meantime I searched the dead man\a146s pockets. There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small folding card-case. From this projected a slip of paper, which I unfolded and handed to the constable. There was written on it in a scrawling, feminine hand:\tI\t will be there, you may be sure.\tM\tAUDIE.\tIt read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were a blank. The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the Burberry. Then, as nothing more suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched.Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held. He brought with him some serious and definite news. As I expected, nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in McPherson\a146s desk and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. We had then established the identity of the writer of the note.\a147The police have the letters,\a148 he explained. \a147I could not bring them. But there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair. I see no reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save, indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.\a148\a147But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of using,\a148 I remarked.\a147It is mere chance,\a148 said he, \a147that several of the students were not with McPherson.\a148\a147Was it mere chance?\a148Stackhurst knit his brows in thought.\a147Ian Murdoch held them back,\a148 said he. \a147He would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast. Poor chap, he is dreadfully cut up about it all.\a148\a147And yet I gather that they were not friends.\a148\a147At one time they were not. But for a year or more Murdoch has been as near to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone. He is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature.\a148\a147So I understand. I seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.\a148\a147That blew over all right.\a148\a147But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.\a148\a147No, no, I am sure they were real friends.\a148\a147Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. Do you know her?\a148\a147Everyone knows her. She is the beauty of the neighbourhood\a151 a real beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. I knew that McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate.\a148\a147But who is she?\a148\a147She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy who owns all the boats and bathing-cots at Fulworth. He was a fisherman to start with, but is now a man of some substance. He and his son William run the business.\a148\a147Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?\a148\a147On what pretext?\a148\a147Oh, we can easily find a pretext. After all, this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outrageous way. Some human hand was on the handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries. His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited. Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.\a148It would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed. The village of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the bay. Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been built upon the rising ground. It was to one of these that Stackhurst guided me.\a147That\a146s The Haven, as Bellamy called it. The one with the corner tower and slate roof. Not bad for a man who started with nothing but\a151 By Jove, look at that!\a148The garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged. There was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure. It was Ian Murdoch, the mathematician. A moment later we confronted him upon the road.\a147Hullo!\a148 said Stackhurst. The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark eyes, and would have-passed us, but his principal pulled him up.\a147What were you doing there?\a148 he asked.Murdoch\a146s face flushed with anger. \a147I am your subordinate, sir, under your roof. I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private actions.\a148Stackhurst\a146s nerves were near the surface after all he had endured. Otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited. Now he lost his temper completely.\a147In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr. Murdoch.\a148\a147Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.\a148\a147This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your insubordinate ways. It will certainly be the last. You will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.\a148\a147I had intended to do so. I have lost to-day the only person who made The Gables habitable.\a148He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. \a147Is he not an impossible, intolerable man?\a148 he cried.The one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr. Ian Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from the scene of the crime. Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in my mind. Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter. Stackhurst pulled himself together, and we went forward to the house.Mr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard. He seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid as his hair.\a147No, sir, I do not desire any particulars. My son here\a148indicating a powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-room\a147is of one mind with me that Mr. McPherson\a146s attentions to Maud were insulting. Yes, sir, the word \a145marriage\a146 was never mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal more of which neither of us could approve. She has no mother, and we are her only guardians. We are determined\a151\a148But the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself. There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world. Who could have imagined that so rare a flower would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere? Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed. Such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in front of Harold Stackhurst.\a147I know already that Fitzroy is dead,\a148 she said. \a147Do not be afraid to tell me the particulars.\a148\a147This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,\a148 explained the father.\a147There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,\a148 growled the younger man.The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him. \a147This is my business, William. Kindly leave me to manage it in my own way. By all accounts there has been a crime committed. If I can help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is gone.\a148She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as a most complete and remarkable woman. It seems that she already knew me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.\a147Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes. You have my sympathy and my help, whoever they may be.\a148 It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke.\a147Thank you,\a148 said I. \a147I value a woman\a146s instinct in such matters. You use the word \a145they.\a146 You think that more than one was concerned?\a148\a147I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man. No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him.\a148\a147Might I have one word with you alone?\a148\a147I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,\a148 cried her father angrily.She looked at me helplessly. \a147What can I do?\a148\a147The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm if I discuss them here,\a148 said I. \a147I should have preferred privacy, but if your father will not allow it he must share the deliberations.\a148 Then I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man\a146s pocket. \a147It is sure to be produced at the inquest. May I ask you to throw any light upon it that you can?\a148\a147I see no reason for mystery,\a148 she answered. \a147We were engaged to be married, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy\a146s uncle, who is very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish. There was no other reason.\a148\a147You could have told us,\a148 growled Mr. Bellamy.\a147So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.\a148\a147I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.\a148\a147\tIt was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you. As to this appointment\a148she fumbled in her dress and produced a crumpled note\a147it was in answer to this.\a148\tD\tEAREST [ran the message]:\tT\the old place on the beach just after sunset on Tuesday. It is the only time I can get away.\tF\t.M. \t\a147Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him to-night.\a148I turned over the paper. \a147This never came by post. How did you get it?\a148\a147I would rather not answer that question. It has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating. But anything which bears upon that I will most freely answer.\a148She was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation. She had no reason to think that her fianc\a233 had any hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers.\a147May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of them?\a148She blushed and seemed confused.\a147There was a time when I thought he was. But that was all changed when he understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.\a148Again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape. His record must be examined. His rooms must be privately searched. Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were forming. We returned from our visit to The Haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands.A week passed. The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adjourned for further evidence. Stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search of his room, but without result. Personally, I had gone over the whole ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new conclusions. In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers. Even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery. And then there came the incident of the dog.It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the countryside.\a147Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson\a146s dog,\a148 said she one evening.I do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my attention.\a147What of Mr. McPherson\a146s dog?\a148\a147Dead, sir. Died of grief for its master.\a148\a147Who told you this?\a148\a147Why, sir, everyone is talking of it. It took on terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from The Gables found it dead\a151 down on the beach, sir, at the very place where its master met his end.\a148\a147At the very place.\a148 The words stood out clear in my memory. Some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind. That the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. But \a147in the very place\a148! Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it? Was it possible that it also had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? Was it possible\a151? Yes, the perception was dim, but already something was building up in my mind. In a few minutes I was on my way to The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study. At my request he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog.\a147Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,\a148 said one of them. \a147It must have followed the trail of its dead master.\a148I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the limbs contorted. There was agony in every line of it.From The Gables I walked down to the bathing-pool. The sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. The place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog\a146s spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master\a146s towel had been laid. For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me. My mind was filled with racing thoughts. You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and which you know is there, though it remains forever just beyond your reach. That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place of death. Then at last I turned and walked slowly homeward.I had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. Like a flash, I remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped. You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge without scientific system, but very available for the needs of my work. My mind is like a crowded box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away therein\a151 so many that I may well have but a vague perception of what was there. I had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter. It was still vague, but at least I knew how I could make it clear. It was monstrous, incredible, and yet it was always a possibility. I would test it to the full.There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books. It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for an hour. At the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver volume. Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim remembrance. Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it might, indeed, be so. It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow.But that work met with an annoying interruption. I had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when_ I had a call from Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabulary\a151 a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled expression.\a147I know your immense experience, sir,\a148 said he. \a147This is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no farther. But I am fairly up against it in this McPherson case. The question is, shall I make an arrest, or shall I not?\a148\a147Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?\a148\a147Yes, sir. There is really no one else when you come to think of it. That\a146s the advantage of this solitude. We narrow it down to a very small compass. If he did not do it, then who did?\a148\a147What have you against him?\a148He had gleaned along the same furrows as I had. There was Murdoch\a146s character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man. His furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog. The fact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to Miss Bellamy. He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that Murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure.\a147What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this evidence against him?\a148 The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind.\a147Consider,\a148 I said, \a147all the essential gaps in your case. On the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi. He had been with his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of McPherson\a146s appearance he came upon us from behind. Then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself. Finally, there is this question of the instrument with which these injuries were inflicted.\a148\a147What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?\a148\a147Have you examined the marks?\a148 I asked.\a147I have seen them. So has the doctor.\a148\a147But I have examined them very carefully with a lens. They have peculiarities.\a148\a147What are they, Mr. Holmes?\a148I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. \a147This is my method in such cases,\a148 I explained.\a147You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147I should hardly be what I am if I did not. Now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder. Do you observe nothing remarkable?\a148\a147I can\a146t say I do.\a148\a147Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity. There is a dot of extravasated blood here, and another there. There are similar indications in this other weal down here. What can that mean?\a148\a147I have no idea. Have you?\a148\a147Perhaps I have. Perhaps I haven\a146t. I may be able to say more soon. Anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal.\a148\a147It is, of course, an absurd idea,\a148 said the policeman, \a147but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these better marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other.\a148\a147A most ingenious comparison. Or shall we say a very stiff cat-o\a146-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?\a148\a147By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.\a148\a147Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardle. But your case is far too weak for an arrest. Besides, we have those last words\a151 the \a145Lion\a146s Mane.\a146\a160\a148\a147I have wondered whether Ian\a151\a148\a147Yes, I have considered that. If the second word had borne any resemblance to Murdoch\a151 but it did not. He gave it almost in a shriek. I am sure that it was \a145Mane.\a146\a160\a148\a147Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Perhaps I have. But I do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss.\a148\a147And when will that be?\a148\a147In an hour\a151 possibly less.\a148The inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes.\a147I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps it\a146s those fishing-boats.\a148\a147No, no, they were too far out.\a148\a147Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his? They were not too sweet upon Mr. McPherson. Could they have done him a mischief?\a148\a147No, no, you won\a146t draw me until I am ready,\a148 said I with a smile. \a147Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do. Perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday\a151\a148So far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was the beginning of the end.My outer door was flung open, there were blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect. \a147Brandy! Brandy!\a148 he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa.He was not alone. Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his companion.\a147Yes, yes, brandy!\a148 he cried. \a147The man is at his last gasp. It was all I could do to bring him here. He fainted twice upon the way.\a148Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change. He pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from his shoulders. \a147For God\a146s sake oil, opium, morphia!\a148 he cried. \a147Anything to ease this infernal agony!\a148The inspector and I cried out at the sight. There, crisscrossed upon the man\a146s naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy McPherson.The pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the sufferer\a146s breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black, and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his brow dropped beads of sweat. At any moment he might die. More and more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him back to life. Pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds. At last his head fell heavily upon the cushion. Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality. It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain.To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of his condition Stackhurst turned upon me.\a147My God!\a148 he cried, \a147what is it, Holmes? What is it?\a148\a147Where did you find him?\a148\a147Down on the beach. Exactly where poor McPherson met his end. If this man\a146s heart had been weak as McPherson\a146s was, he would not be here now. More than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up. It was too far to The Gables, so I made for you.\a148\a147Did you see him on the beach?\a148\a147I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry. He was at the edge of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. I ran down, threw some clothes about him, and brought him up. For heaven\a146s sake, Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. Can you, with all your world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?\a148\a147I think I can, Stackhurst. Come with me now! And you, Inspector, come along! We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands.\a148Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all three went down to the deadly lagoon. On the shingle there was piled a little heap of towels and clothes left by the stricken man. Slowly I walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind me. Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep. It was to this part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. A line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly into the depths beneath me. I had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I burst into a shout of triumph.\a147Cyanea!\a148 I cried. \a147Cyanea! Behold the Lion\a146s Mane!\a148The strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane of a lion. It lay upon a rocky shelf some three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses. It pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation and contraction.\a147It has done mischief enough. Its day is over!\a148 I cried. \a147Help me, Stackhurst! Let us end the murderer forever.\a148There was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it fell with a tremendous splash into the water. When the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. One flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. A thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round, rising slowly to the surface.\a147Well, this gets me!\a148 cried the inspector. \a147What was it, Mr. Holmes? I\a146m born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing. It don\a146t belong to Sussex.\a148\a147Just as well for Sussex,\a148 I remarked. \a147It may have been the southwest gale that brought it up. Come back to my house, both of you, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.\a148When we reached my study we found that Murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up. He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. In broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank.\a147\tHere is a book,\a148 I said, taking up the little volume, \a147which first brought light into what might have been forever dark. It is Out of Doors, by the famous observer, J. G. Wood. Wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. Cyanea capillata is the miscreant\a146s full name, and he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite of the cobra. Let me briefly give this extract.\t\a147\tIf the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion\a146s mane and silver paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata. \tCould our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described?\a147\tHe goes on to tell of his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of Kent. He found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death. Even at a distance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal.\t\a147\tThe multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves. \t\a147\tThe local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite torment.\t\a147\tPangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if struck by a bullet. The pulsation would cease, and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest. \t\a147It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool. He says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. He gulped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. There is the book, Inspector. I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.\a148\a147And incidentally exonerates me,\a148 remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry smile. \a147I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your suspicions were natural. I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.\a148\a147No, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the track, and had I been out as early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific experience.\a148\a147But how did you know, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles. That phrase \a145the Lion\a146s Mane\a146 haunted my mind. I knew that I had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. You have seen that it does describe the creature. I have no doubt that it was floating on the water when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death.\a148\a147Then I, at least, am cleared,\a148 said Murdoch, rising slowly to his feet. \a147There are one or two words of explanation which I should give, for I know the direction in which your inquiries have run. It is true that I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend McPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness. I was well content to stand aside and act as their go-between. Often I carried their messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my friend\a146s death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner. She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest you should disapprove and I might suffer. But with your leave I must try to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.\a148Stackhurst held out his hand. \a147Our nerves have all been at concert-pitch,\a148 said he. \a147Forgive what is past, Murdoch. We shall understand each other better in the future.\a148 They passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion. The inspector remained, staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes.\a147Well, you\a146ve done it!\a148 he cried at last. \a147I had read of you, but I never believed it. It\a146s wonderful!\a148I was forced to shake my head. To accept such praise was to lower one\a146s own standards.\a147I was slow at the outset\a151 culpably slow. Had the body been found in the water I could hardly have missed it. It was the towel which misled me. The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water. Why, then, should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me? That was where I went astray. Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force, but Cyanea capillata very nearly avenged Scotland Yard.\a148\p\X1\BThe Retired Colourman\B\X1\c\i\m="RETI-04.png"\i\cSherlock Holmes was in a melancholy and philosophic mood that morning. His alert practical nature was subject to such reactions.\a147Did you see him?\a148 he asked.\a147You mean the old fellow who has just gone out?\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147Yes, I met him at the door.\a148\a147What did you think of him?\a148\a147A pathetic, futile, broken creature.\a148\a147Exactly, Watson. Pathetic and futile. But is not all life pathetic and futile? Is not his story a microcosm of the whole? We reach. We grasp. And what is left in our hands at the end? A shadow. Or worse than a shadow\a151 misery.\a148\a147Is he one of your clients?\a148\a147Well, I suppose I may call him so. He has been sent on by the Yard. Just as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack. They argue that they can do nothing more, and that whatever happens the patient can be no worse than he is.\a148\a147What is the matter?\a148Holmes took a rather soiled card from the table. \a147Josiah Amberley. He says he was junior partner of Brickfall and Amberley, who are manufacturers of artistic materials. You will see their names upon paint-boxes. He made his little pile, retired from business at the age of sixty-one, bought a house at Lewisham, and settled down to rest after a life of ceaseless grind. One would think his future was tolerably assured.\a148\a147Yes, indeed.\a148Holmes glanced over some notes which he had scribbled upon the back of an envelope.\a147Retired in 1896, Watson. Early in 1897 he married a woman twenty years younger than himself\a151 a good-looking woman, too, if the photograph does not flatter. A competence, a wife, leisure\a151 it seemed a straight road which lay before him. And yet within two years he is, as you have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath the sun.\a148\a147But what has happened?\a148\a147The old story, Watson. A treacherous friend and a fickle wife. It would appear that Amberley has one hobby in life, and it is chess. Not far from him at Lewisham there lives a young doctor who is also a chess-player. I have noted his name as Dr. Ray Ernest. Ernest was frequently in the house, and an intimacy between him and Mrs. Amberley was a natural sequence, for you must admit that our unfortunate client has few outward graces, whatever his inner virtues may be. The couple went off together last week\a151 destination untraced. What is more, the faithless spouse carried off the old man\a146s deed-box as her personal luggage with a good part of his life\a146s savings within. Can we find the lady? Can we save the money? A commonplace problem so far as it has developed, and yet a vital one for Josiah Amberley.\a148\a147What will you do about it?\a148\a147Well, the immediate question, my dear Watson, happens to be, What will you do?if you will be good enough to understudy me. You know that I am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic Patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day. I really have not time to go out to Lewisham, and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value. The old fellow was quite insistent that I should go, but I explained my difficulty. He is prepared to meet a representative.\a148\a147By all means,\a148 I answered. \a147I confess I don\a146t see that I can be of much service, but I am willing to do my best.\a148 And so it was that on a summer afternoon I set forth to Lewisham, little dreaming that within a week the affair in which I was engaging would be the eager debate of all England.It was late that evening before I returned to Baker Street and gave an account of my mission. Holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in his deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths of acrid tobacco, while his eyelids drooped over his eyes so lazily that he might almost have been asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable passage of my narrative they half lifted, and two gray eyes, as bright and keen as rapiers, transfixed me with their searching glance.\a147The Haven is the name of Mr. Josiah Amberley\a146s house,\a148 I explained. \a147I think it would interest you, Holmes. It is like some penurious patrician who has sunk into the company of his inferiors. You know that particular quarter, the monotonous brick streets, the weary suburban highways. Right in the middle of them, a little island of ancient culture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded by a high sun-baked wall mottled with lichens and topped with moss, the sort of wall\a151\a148\a147Cut out the poetry, Watson,\a148 said Holmes severely. \a147I note that it was a high brick wall.\a148\a147Exactly. I should not have known which was The Haven had I not asked a lounger who was smoking in the street. I have a reason for mentioning him. He was a tall, dark, heavily moustached, rather military-looking man. He nodded in answer to my inquiry and gave me a curiously questioning glance, which came back to my memory a little later.\a147I had hardly entered the gateway before I saw Mr. Amberley coming down the drive. I only had a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly gave me the impression of a strange creature, but when I saw him in full light his appearance was even more abnormal.\a148\a147I have, of course, studied it, and yet I should be interested to have your impression,\a148 said Holmes.\a147He seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care. His back was curved as though he carried a heavy burden. Yet he was not the weakling that I had at first imagined, for his shoulders and chest have the framework of a giant, though his figure tapers away into a pair of spindled legs.\a148\a147Left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.\a148\a147I did not observe that.\a148\a147No, you wouldn\a146t. I spotted his artificial limb. But proceed.\a148\a147I was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from under his old straw hat, and his face with its fierce, eager expression and the deeply lined features.\a148\a147Very good, Watson. What did he say?\a148\a147He began pouring out the story of his grievances. We walked down the drive together, and of course I took a good look round. I have never seen a worse-kept place. The garden was all running to seed, giving me an impression of wild neglect in which the plants had been allowed to find the way of Nature rather than of art. How any decent woman could have tolerated such a state of things, I don\a146t know. The house, too, was slatternly to the last degree, but the poor man seemed himself to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it, for a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of the hall, and he was carrying a thick brush in his left hand. He had been working on the woodwork.\a147He took me into his dingy sanctum, and we had a long chat. Of course, he was disappointed that you had not come yourself. \a145I hardly expected,\a146 he said, \a145that so humble an individual as myself, especially after my heavy financial loss, could obtain the complete attention of so famous a man as Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a147I assured him that the financial question did not arise. \a145No of course, it is art for art\a146s sake with him,\a146 said he, \a145but even on the artistic side of crime he might have found something here to study. And human nature, Dr. Watson\a151 the black ingratitude of it all! When did I ever refuse one of her requests? Was ever a woman so pampered? And that young man\a151 he might have been my own son. He had the run of my house. And yet see how they have treated me! Oh, Dr. Watson, it is a dreadful, dreadful world!\a146\a147That was the burden of his song for an hour or more. He had, it seems, no suspicion of an intrigue. They lived alone save for a woman who comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six. On that particular evening old Amberley, wishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two upper circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre. At the last moment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go. He had gone alone. There seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he produced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife.\a148\a147That is remarkable\a151 most remarkable,\a148 said Holmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be rising. \a147Pray continue, Watson. I find your narrative most arresting. Did you personally examine this ticket? You did not, perchance, take the number?\a148\a147It so happens that I did,\a148 I answered with some pride. \a147It chanced to be my old school number, thirty-one, and so is stuck in my head.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! His seat, then, was either thirty or thirty-two.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 I answered with some mystification. \a147And on B row.\a148\a147That is most satisfactory. What else did he tell you?\a148\a147He showed me his strong-room, as he called it. It really is a strong-room\a151 like a bank\a151 with iron door and shutter\a151 burglarproof, as he claimed. However, the woman seems to have had a duplicate key, and between them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds\a146 worth of cash and securities.\a148\a147Securities! How could they dispose of those?\a148\a147He said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they would be unsaleable. He had got back from the theatre about midnight and found the place plundered, the door and window open, and the fugitives gone. There was no letter or message, nor has he heard a word since. He at once gave the alarm to the police.\a148Holmes brooded for some minutes.\a147You say he was painting. What was he painting?\a148\a147Well, he was painting the passage. But he had already painted the door and woodwork of this room I spoke of.\a148\a147Does it not strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances?\a148\a147\a160\a145One must do something to ease an aching heart.\a146 That was his own explanation. It was eccentric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man. He tore up one of his wife\a146s photographs in my presence\a151 tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion. \a145I never wish to see her damned face again,\a146 he shrieked.\a148\a147Anything more, Watson?\a148\a147Yes, one thing which struck me more than anything else. I had driven to the Blackheath Station and had caught my train there when, just as it was starting, I saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own. You know that I have a quick eye for faces, Holmes. It was undoubtedly the tall, dark man whom I had addressed in the street. I saw him once more at London Bridge, and then I lost him in the crowd. But I am convinced that he was following me.\a148\a147No doubt! No doubt!\a148 said Holmes. \a147A tall, dark, heavily moustached man, you say, with gray-tinted sun-glasses?\a148\a147Holmes, you are a wizard. I did not say so, but he had gray-tinted sun-glasses.\a148\a147And a Masonic tie-pin?\a148\a147Holmes!\a148\a147Quite simple, my dear Watson. But let us get down to what is practical. I must admit to you that the case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly assuming a very different aspect. It is true that though in your mission you have missed everything of importance, yet even those things which have obtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought.\a148\a147What have I missed?\a148\a147Don\a146t be hurt, my dear fellow. You know that I am quite impersonal. No one else would have done better. Some possibly not so well. But clearly you have missed some vital points. What is the opinion of the neighbours about this man Amberley and his wife? That surely is of importance. What of Dr. Ernest? Was he the gay Lothario one would expect? With your natural advantages, Watson, every lady is your helper and accomplice. What about the girl at the post-office, or the wife of the greengrocer? I can picture you whispering soft nothings with the young lady at the Blue Anchor, and receiving hard somethings in exchange. All this you have left undone.\a148\a147It can still be done.\a148\a147It has been done. Thanks to the telephone and the help of the Yard, I can usually get my essentials without leaving this room. As a matter of fact, my information confirms the man\a146s story. He has the local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband. That he had a large sum of money in that strong-room of his is certain. So also is it that young Dr. Ernest, an unmarried man, played chess with Amberley, and probably played the fool with his wife. All this seems plain sailing, and one would think that there was no more to be said\a151 and yet!and yet!\a148\a147Where lies the difficulty?\a148\a147In my imagination, perhaps. Well, leave it there, Watson. Let us escape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music. Carina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still have time to dress, dine, and enjoy.\a148I\tn the morning I was up betimes, but some toast crumbs and two empty eggshells told me that my companion was earlier still. I found a scribbled note upon the table.\tD\tEAR WATSON:\tT\there are one or two points of contact which I should wish to establish with Mr. Josiah Amberley. When I have done so we can dismiss the case\a151 or not. I would only ask you to be on hand about three o\a146clock, as I conceive it possible that I may want you.\tS\t.H. \tI saw nothing of Holmes all day, but at the hour named he returned, grave, preoccupied, and aloof. At such times it was wiser to leave him to himself.\a147Has Amberley been here yet?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Ah! I am expecting him.\a148He was not disappointed, for presently the old fellow arrived with a very worried and puzzled expression upon his austere face.\a147\tI\a146ve had a telegram, Mr. Holmes. I can make nothing of it.\a148 He handed it over, and Holmes read it aloud.\t\a147\tCome at once without fail. Can give you information as to your recent loss.\t\a147\tELMAN.\t\a147\tThe Vicarage. \t\a147Dispatched at 2:10 from Little Purlington,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Little Purlington is in Essex, I believe, not far from Frinton. Well, of course you will start at once. This is evidently from a responsible person, the vicar of the place. Where is my Crockford? Yes, here we have him: \a145J. C. Elman, M. A., Living of Moosmoor cum Little Purlington.\a146 Look up the trains, Watson.\a148\a147There is one at 5:20 from Liverpool Street.\a148\a147Excellent. You had best go with him, Watson. He may need help or advice. Clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair.\a148But our client seemed by no means eager to start.\a147It\a146s perfectly absurd, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147What can this man possibly know of what has occurred? It is waste of time and money.\a148\a147He would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something. Wire at once that you are coming.\a148\a147I don\a146t think I shall go.\a148Holmes assumed his sternest aspect.\a147It would make the worst possible impression both on the police and upon myself, Mr. Amberley, if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse to follow it up. We should feel that you were not really in earnest in this investigation.\a148Our client seemed horrified at the suggestion.\a147Why, of course I shall go if you look at it in that way,\a148 said he. \a147On the face of it, it seems absurd to suppose that this parson knows anything, but if you think\a151\a148\a147I do think,\a148 said Holmes with emphasis, and so we were launched upon our journey. Holmes took me aside before we left the room and gave me one word of counsel, which showed that he considered the matter to be of importance. \a147Whatever you do, see that he really does go,\a148 said he. \a147Should he break away or return, get to the nearest telephone exchange and send the single word \a145Bolted.\a146 I will arrange here that it shall reach me wherever I am.\a148Little Purlington is not an easy place to reach, for it is on a branch line. My remembrance of the journey is not a pleasant one, for the weather was hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and silent, hardly talking at all save to make an occasional sardonic remark as to the futility of our proceedings. When we at last reached the little station it was a two-mile drive before we came to the Vicarage, where a big, solemn, rather pompous clergyman received us in his study. Our telegram lay before him.\a147Well, gentlemen,\a148 he asked, \a147what can I do for you?\a148\a147We came,\a148 I explained, \a147in answer to your wire.\a148\a147My wire! I sent no wire.\a148\a147I mean the wire which you sent to Mr. Josiah Amberley about his wife and his money.\a148\a147If this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable one,\a148 said the vicar angrily. \a147I have never heard of the gentleman you name, and I have not sent a wire to anyone.\a148Our client and I looked at each other in amazement.\a147Perhaps there is some mistake,\a148 said I; \a147are there perhaps two vicarages? Here is the wire itself, signed Elman and dated from the Vicarage.\a148\a147There is only one vicarage, sir, and only one vicar, and this wire is a scandalous forgery, the origin of which shall certainly be investigated by the police. Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in prolonging this interview.\a148So Mr. Amberley and I found ourselves on the roadside in what seemed to me to be the most primitive village in England. We made for the telegraph office, but it was already closed. There was a telephone, however, at the little Railway Arms, and by it I got into touch with Holmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey.\a147Most singular!\a148 said the distant voice. \a147Most remarkable! I much fear, my dear Watson, that there is no return train to-night. I have unwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn. However, there is always Nature, Watson\a151 Nature and Josiah Amberley\a151 you can be in close commune with both.\a148 I heard his dry chuckle as he turned away.It was soon apparent to me that my companion\a146s reputation as a miser was not undeserved. He had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had insisted upon travelling third-class, and was now clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill. Next morning, when we did at last arrive in London, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour.\a147You had best take Baker Street as we pass,\a148 said I. \a147Mr. Holmes may have some fresh instructions.\a148\a147If they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much use,\a148 said Amberley with a malevolent scowl. None the less, he kept me company. I had already warned Holmes by telegram of the hour of our arrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at Lewisham and would expect us there. That was a surprise, but an even greater one was to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client. A stern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with gray-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from his tie.\a147This is my friend Mr. Barker,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He has been interesting himself also in your business, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been working independently. But we both have the same question to ask you!\a148Mr. Amberley sat down heavily. He sensed impending danger. I read it in his straining eyes and his twitching features.\a147What is the question, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Only this: What did you do with the bodies?\a148The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream. He clawed into the air with his bony hands. His mouth was open, and for the instant he looked like some horrible bird of prey. In a flash we got a glimpse of the real Josiah Amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as his body. As he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his lips as if to stifle a cough. Holmes sprang at his throat like a tiger and twisted his face towards the ground. A white pellet fell from between his gasping lips.\a147No short cuts, Josiah Amberley. Things must be done decently and in order. What about it, Barker?\a148\a147I have a cab at the door,\a148 said our taciturn companion.\a147It is only a few hundred yards to the station. We will go together. You can stay here, Watson. I shall be back within half an hour.\a148The old colourman had the strength of a lion in that great trunk of his, but he was helpless in the hands of the two experienced man-handlers. Wriggling and twisting he was dragged to the waiting cab, and I was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-omened house. In less time than he had named, however, Holmes was back, in company with a smart young police inspector.\a147I\a146ve left Barker to look after the formalities,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You had not met Barker, Watson. He is my hated rival upon the Surrey shore. When you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to complete the picture. He has several good cases to his credit, has he not, Inspector?\a148\a147He has certainly interfered several times,\a148 the inspector answered with reserve.\a147His methods are irregular, no doubt, like my own. The irregulars are useful sometimes, you know. You, for example, with your compulsory warning about whatever he said being used against him, could never have bluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession.\a148\a147Perhaps not. But we get there all the same, Mr. Holmes. Don\a146t imagine that we had not formed our own views of this case, and that we would not have laid our hands on our man. You will excuse us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use, and so rob us of the credit.\a148\a147There shall be no such robbery, MacKinnon. I assure you that I efface myself from now onward, and as to Barker, he has done nothing save what I told him.\a148The inspector seemed considerably relieved.\a147That is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. Praise or blame can matter little to you, but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin to ask questions.\a148\a147Quite so. But they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow, so it would be as well to have answers. What will you say, for example, when the intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact points were which aroused your suspicion, and finally gave you a certain conviction as to the real facts?\a148The inspector looked puzzled.\a147We don\a146t seem to have got any real facts yet, Mr. Holmes. You say that the prisoner, in the presence of three witnesses, practically confessed by trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his wife and her lover. What other facts have you?\a148\a147Have you arranged for a search?\a148\a147There are three constables on their way.\a148\a147Then you will soon get the clearest fact of all. The bodies cannot be far away. Try the cellars and the garden. It should not take long to dig up the likely places. This house is older than the water-pipes. There must be a disused well somewhere. Try your luck there.\a148\a147But how did you know of it, and how was it done?\a148\a147I\a146ll show you first how it was done, and then I will give the explanation which is due to you, and even more to my longsuffering friend here, who has been invaluable throughout. But, first, I would give you an insight into this man\a146s mentality. It is a very unusual one\a151 so much so that I think his destination is more likely to be Broadmoor than the scaffold. He has, to a high degree, the sort of mind which one associates with the mediaeval Italian nature rather than with the modern Briton. He was a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any adventurer. Such a one came upon the scene in the person of this chess-playing doctor. Amberley excelled at chess\a151 one mark, Watson, of a scheming mind. Like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania. Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. He determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with diabolical cleverness. Come here!\a148Holmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had lived in the house and halted at the open door of the strong-room.\a147Pooh! What an awful smell of paint!\a148 cried the inspector.\a147That was our first clue,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You can thank Dr. Watson\a146s observation for that, though he failed to draw the inference. It set my foot upon the trail. Why should this man at such a time be filling his house with strong odours? Obviously, to cover some other smell which he wished to conceal\a151 some guilty smell which would suggest suspicions. Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with iron door and shutter\a151 a hermetically sealed room. Put those two facts together, and whither do they lead? I could only determine that by examining the house myself. I was already certain that the case was serious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket Theatre\a151 another of Dr. Watson\a146s bull\a146s-eyes\a151 and ascertained that neither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied that night. Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife. The question now arose how I might be able to examine the house. I sent an agent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back. To prevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him. The good vicar\a146s name I took, of course, out of my Crockford. Do I make it all clear to you?\a148\a147It is masterly,\a148 said the inspector in an awed voice.\a147There being no fear of interruption I proceeded to burgle the house. Burglary has always been an alternative profession had I cared to adopt it, and I have little doubt that I should have come to the front. Observe what I found. You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here. Very good. It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here in the corner. The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see, and ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is concealed by the ornamentation. That end is wide open. At any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas. With door and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little chamber. By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know, but once inside the door they were at his mercy.\a148The inspector examined the pipe with interest. \a147One of our officers mentioned the smell of gas,\a148 said he, \a147but of course the window and door were open then, and the paint\a151 or some of it\a151 was already about. He had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his story. But what next, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself. I was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a hand inside my collar, and a voice said: \a145Now, you rascal, what are you doing in there?\a146 When I could twist my head round I looked into the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker. It was a curious foregathering and set us both smiling. It seems that he had been engaged by Dr. Ray Ernest\a146s family to make some investigations and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play. He had watched the house for some days and had spotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously suspicious characters who had called there. He could hardly arrest Watson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry window there came a limit to his restraint. Of course, I told him how matters stood and we continued the case together.\a148\a147Why him? Why not us?\a148\a147Because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so admirably. I fear you would not have gone so far.\a148The inspector smiled.\a147Well, maybe not. I understand that I have your word, Mr. Holmes, that you step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results over to us.\a148\a147Certainly, that is always my custom.\a148\a147Well, in the name of the force I thank you. It seems a clear case, as you put it, and there can\a146t be much difficulty over the bodies.\a148\a147I\a146ll show you a grim little bit of evidence,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and I am sure Amberley himself never observed it. You\a146ll get results, Inspector, by always putting yourself in the other fellow\a146s place, and thinking what you would do yourself. It takes some imagination, but it pays. Now, we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room, had not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even with the fiend who was probably mocking at you from the other side of the door. What would you do?\a148\a147Write a message.\a148\a147Exactly. You would like to tell people how you died. No use writing on paper. That would be seen. If you wrote on the wall someone might rest upon it. Now, look here! Just above the skirting is scribbled with a purple indelible pencil: \a145We we\a151\a146 That\a146s all.\a146\a146\a147What do you make of that?\a148\a147Well, it\a146s only a foot above the ground. The poor devil was on the floor dying when he wrote it. He lost his senses before he could finish.\a148\a147He was writing, \a145We were murdered.\a146\a160\a148\a147That\a146s how I read it. If you find an indelible pencil on the body\a151\a148\a147We\a146ll look out for it, you may be sure. But those securities? Clearly there was no robbery at all. And yet he did possess those bonds. We verified that.\a148\a147You may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place. When the whole elopement had passed into history, he would suddenly discover them and announce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder or had dropped it on the way.\a148\a147You certainly seem to have met every difficulty,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Of course, he was bound to call us in, but why he should have gone to you I can\a146t understand.\a148\a147Pure swank!\a148 Holmes answered. \a147He felt so clever and so sure of himself that he imagined no one could touch him. He could say to any suspicious neighbour, \a145Look at the steps I have taken. I have consulted not only the police but even Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a160\a148The inspector laughed.\a147We must forgive you your \a145even,\a146 Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he \a147it\a146s as workmanlike a job as I can remember.\a148A\t couple of days later my friend tossed across to me a copy of the bi-weekly North Surrey Observer. Under a series of flaming headlines, which began with \a147The Haven Horror\a148 and ended with \a147Brilliant Police Investigation,\a148 there was a packed column of print which gave the first consecutive account of the affair. The concluding paragraph is typical of the whole. It ran thus:\tT\the remarkable acumen by which Inspector MacKinnon deduced from the smell of paint that some other smell, that of gas, for example, might be concealed; the bold deduction that the strong-room might also be the death-chamber, and the subsequent inquiry which led to the discovery of the bodies in a disused well, cleverly concealed by a dogkennel, should live in the history of crime as a standing example of the intelligence of our professional detectives. \t\a147Well, well, MacKinnon is a good fellow,\a148 said Holmes with a tolerant smile. \a147You can file it in our archives, Watson. Some day the true story may be told.\a148\p\X1\BThe Veiled Lodger\B\X1\c\i\m="VEIL-03.png"\i\cWhen one considers that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was in active practice for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was allowed to cooperate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it will be clear that I have a mass of material at my command. The problem has always been not to find but to choose. There is the long row of year-books which fill a shelf and there are the dispatch-cases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the student not only of crime but of the social and official scandals of the late Victorian era. Concerning these latter, I may say that the writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched, have nothing to fear. The discretion and high sense of professional honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr. Holmes\a146s authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. There is at least one reader who will understand.It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs. Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it fell easily into his lap. But the most terrible human tragedies were often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record. In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but otherwise the facts are as stated.One forenoon\a151 it was late in 1896I received a hurried note from Holmes asking for my attendance. When I arrived I found him seated in a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.\a147This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\a148 said my friend with a wave of the hand. \a147Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if you wish to indulge your filthy habits. Mrs. Merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful.\a148\a147Anything I can do\a151\a148\a147You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I should prefer to have a witness. You will make her understand that before we arrive.\a148\a147Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said our visitor, \a147she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!\a148\a147Then we shall come early in the afternoon. Let us see that we have our facts correct before we start. If we go over them it will help Dr. Watson to understand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face.\a148\a147And I wish to God I had not!\a148 said Mrs. Merrilow.\a147It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. That\a146s how it looked. Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the front garden. That is the kind of face it is. When I saw her\a151 I happened on her unawares\a151 she covered up quick, and then she said, \a145Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my veil.\a146\a160\a148\a147Do you know anything about her history?\a148\a147Nothing at all.\a148\a147Did she give references when she came?\a148\a147No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. A quarter\a146s rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. In these times a poor woman like me can\a146t afford to turn down a chance like that.\a148\a147Did she give any reason for choosing your house?\a148\a147Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most. Then, again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own. I reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. It\a146s privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.\a148\a147You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion. Well, it is a very remarkable story, most remarkable, and I don\a146t wonder that you want it examined.\a148\a147I don\a146t, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent. You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\a148\a147Then what has brought matters to a head?\a148\a147Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there\a146s something terrible on her mind. \a145Murder!\a146 she cries. \a145Murder!\a146 And once I heard her: \a145You cruel beast! You monster!\a146 she cried. It was in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers through me. So I went to her in the morning. \a145Mrs. Ronder,\a146 I says, \a145if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there\a146s the clergy,\a146 I says, \a145and there\a146s the police. Between them you should get some help.\a146 \a145For God\a146s sake, not the police!\a146 says she, \a145and the clergy can\a146t change what is past. And yet,\a146 she says, \a145it would ease my mind if someone knew the truth before I died.\a146 \a145Well,\a146 says I, \a145if you won\a146t have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read about\a146beggin\a146 your pardon, Mr. Holmes. And she, she fair jumped at it. \a145That\a146s the man,\a146 says she. \a145I wonder I never thought of it before. Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if he won\a146t come, tell him I am the wife of Ronder\a146s wild beast show. Say that, and give him the name Abbas Parva. Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. \a145That will bring him if he\a146s the man I think he is.\a146\a160\a148\a147And it will, too,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147Very good, Mrs. Merrilow. I should like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us till lunch-time. About three o\a146clock you may expect to see us at your house in Brixton.\a148Our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room\a151 no other verb can describe Mrs. Merrilow\a146s method of progression\a151 than Sherlock Holmes threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in the corner. For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he sought. So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the floor like some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round him, and one open upon his knees.\a147The case worried me at the time, Watson. Here are my marginal notes to prove it. I confess that I could make nothing of it. And yet I was convinced that the coroner was wrong. Have you no recollection of the Abbas Parva tragedy?\a148\a147None, Holmes.\a148\a147And yet you were with me then. But certainly my own impression was very superficial. For there was nothing to go by, and none of the parties had engaged my services. Perhaps you would care to read the papers?\a148\a147Could you not give me the points?\a148\a147That is very easily done. It will probably come back to your memory as I talk. Ronder, of course, was a household word. He was the rival of Wombwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day. There is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy. The caravan had halted for the night at Abbas Parva, which is a small village in Berkshire, when this horror occurred. They were on their way to Wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not have paid them to open.\a147They had among their exhibits a very fine North African lion. Sahara King was its name, and it was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife, to give exhibitions inside its cage. Here, you see, is a photograph of the performance by which you will perceive that Ronder was a huge porcine person and that his wife was a very magnificent woman. It was deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was dangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice was taken of the fact.\a147It was usual for either Ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night. Sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors and would never molest them. On this particular night, seven years ago, they both went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which have never been made clear.\a147It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman. The different grooms and employees rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their light an awful sight was revealed. Ronder lay, with the back of his head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards from the cage, which was open. Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs. Ronder upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above her. It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought that she could live. Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo, the strong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked in. How it had got loose was a mystery. It was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them. There was no other point of interest in the evidence save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept screaming, \a145Coward! Coward!\a146 as she was carried back to the van in which they lived. It was six months before she was fit to give evidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure.\a148\a147What alternative could be conceived?\a148 said I.\a147You may well say so. And yet there were one or two points which worried young Edmunds, of the Berkshire Constabulary. A smart lad that! He was sent later to Allahabad. That was how I came into the matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.\a148\a147A thin, yellow-haired man?\a148\a147Exactly. I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.\a148\a147But what worried him?\a148\a147Well, we were both worried. It was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair. Look at it from the lion\a146s point of view. He is liberated. What does he do? He takes half a dozen bounds forward, which brings him to Ronder. Ronder turns to fly\a151 the claw-marks were on the back of his head\a151 but the lion strikes him down. Then, instead of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. Then, again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her. What could the poor devil have done to help her? You see the difficulty?\a148\a147Quite.\a148\a147And then there was another thing. It comes back to me now as I think it over. There was some evidence that just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.\a148\a147This man Ronder, no doubt.\a148\a147Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again. There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman.\a148\a147I should think the whole camp was crying out by then. As to the other points, I think I could suggest a solution.\a148\a147I should be glad to consider it.\a148\a147The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got loose. The man turned and was struck down. The woman conceived the idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. It was her only refuge. She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded after her and knocked her over. She was angry with her husband for having encouraged the beast\a146s rage by turning. If they had faced it they might have cowed it. Hence her cries of \a145Coward!\a146\a160\a148\a147Brilliant, Watson! Only one flaw in your diamond.\a148\a147What is the flaw, Holmes?\a148\a147If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get loose?\a148\a147Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?\a148\a147And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?\a148\a147Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.\a148Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.\a147Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. Ronder was a man of many enemies. Edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way. I expect those cries about a monster, of which our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed. However, our speculations are futile until we have all the facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon them.\a148When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired abode. It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end. Then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight, badly carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious lodger.It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected, since its inmate seldom left it. From keeping beasts in a cage, the woman seemed, by some retribution of fate, to have become herself a beast in a cage. She sat now in a broken armchair in the shadowy corner of the room. Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was still full and voluptuous. A thick dark veil covered her face, but it was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed a perfectly shaped mouth and a delicately rounded chin. I could well conceive that she had indeed been a very remarkable woman. Her voice, too, was well modulated and pleasing.\a147My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said she. \a147I thought that it would bring you.\a148\a147That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was interested in your case.\a148\a147I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr. Edmunds, the county detective. I fear I lied to him. Perhaps it would have been wiser had I told the truth.\a148\a147It is usually wiser to tell the truth. But why did you lie to him?\a148\a147Because the fate of someone else depended upon it. I know that he was a very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction upon my conscience. We had been so close\a151 so close!\a148\a147But has this impediment been removed?\a148\a147Yes, sir. The person that I allude to is dead.\a148\a147Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?\a148\a147Because there is another person to be considered. That other person is myself. I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from a police examination. I have not long to live, but I wish to die undisturbed. And yet I wanted to find one man of judgment to whom I could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might be understood.\a148\a147You compliment me, madam. At the same time, I am a responsible person. I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.\a148\a147I think not, Mr. Holmes. I know your character and methods too well, for I have followed your work for some years. Reading is the only pleasure which fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in the world. But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy. It will ease my mind to tell it.\a148\a147My friend and I would be glad to hear it.\a148The woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. He was clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile breaking from under his heavy moustache\a151 the self-satisfied smile of the man of many conquests.\a147That is Leonardo,\a148 she said.\a147Leonardo, the strong man, who gave evidence?\a148\a147The same. And this\a151 this is my husband.\a148It was a dreadful face\a151 a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for it was formidable in its bestiality. One could imagine that vile mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the world. Ruffian, bully, beast\a151 it was all written on that heavy-jowled face.\a147Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the story. I was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing springs through the hoop before I was ten. When I became a woman this man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil moment I became his wife. From that day I was in hell, and he the devil who tormented me. There was no one in the show who did not know of his treatment. He deserted me for others. He tied me down and lashed me with his ridingwhip when I complained. They all pitied me and they all loathed him, but what could they do? They feared him, one and all. For he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he was drunk. Again and again he was had up for assault, and for cruelty to the beasts, but he had plenty of money and the fines were nothing to him. The best men all left us, and the show began to go downhill. It was only Leonardo and I who kept it up\a151 with little Jimmy Griggs, the clown. Poor devil, he had not much to be funny about, but he did what he could to hold things together.\a147Then Leonardo came more and more into my life. You see what he was like. I know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body, but compared to my husband he seemed like the angel Gabriel. He pitied me and helped me, till at last our intimacy turned to love\a151 deep, deep, passionate love, such love as I had dreamed of but never hoped to feel. My husband suspected it, but I think that he was a coward as well as a bully, and that Leonardo was the one man that he was afraid of. He took revenge in his own way by torturing me more than ever. One night my cries brought Leonardo to the door of our van. We were near tragedy that night, and soon my lover and I understood that it could not be avoided. My husband was not fit to live. We planned that he should die.\a147Leonardo had a clever, scheming brain. It was he who planned it. I do not say that to blame him, for I was ready to go with him every inch of the way. But I should never have had the wit to think of such a plan. We made a club\a151 Leonardo made it\a151 and in the leaden head he fastened five long steel nails, the points outward, with just such a spread as the lion\a146s paw. This was to give my husband his death-blow, and yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose who had done the deed.\a147It was a pitch-dark night when my husband and I went down, as was our custom, to feed the beast. We carried with us the raw meat in a zinc pail. Leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we should have to pass before we reached the cage. He was too slow, and we walked past him before he could strike, but he followed us on tiptoe and I heard the crash as the club smashed my husband\a146s skull. My heart leaped with joy at the sound. I sprang forward, and I undid the catch which held the door of the great lion\a146s cage.\a147And then the terrible thing happened. You may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood, and how it excites them. Some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human being had been slain. As I slipped the bars it bounded out and was on me in an instant. Leonardo could have saved me. If he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it. But the man lost his nerve. I heard him shout in his terror, and then I saw him turn and fly. At the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face. Its hot, filthy breath had already poisoned me and I was hardly conscious of pain. With the palms of my hands I tried to push the great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me, and I screamed for help. I was conscious that the camp was stirring, and then dimly I remembered a group of men. Leonardo, Griggs, and others, dragging me from under the creature\a146s paws. That was my last memory, Mr. Holmes, for many a weary month. When I came to myself and saw myself in the mirror, I cursed that lion\a151 oh, how I cursed him!not because he had torn away my beauty but because he had not torn away my life. I had but one desire, Mr. Holmes, and I had enough money to gratify it. It was that I should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none, and that I should dwell where none whom I had ever known should find me. That was all that was left to me to do\a151 and that is what I have done. A poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die\a151 that is the end of Eugenia Ronder.\a148We sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her story. Then Holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with such a show of sympathy as I had seldom known him to exhibit.\a147Poor girl!\a148 he said. \a147Poor girl! The ways of fate are indeed hard to understand. If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the world is a cruel jest. But what of this man Leonardo?\a148\a147I never saw him or heard from him again. Perhaps I have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him. He might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left. But a woman\a146s love is not so easily set aside. He had left me under the beast\a146s claws, he had deserted me in my need, and yet I could not bring myself to give him to the gallows. For myself, I cared nothing what became of me. What could be more dreadful than my actual life? But I stood between Leonardo and his fate.\a148\a147And he is dead?\a148\a147He was drowned last month when bathing near Margate. I saw his death in the paper.\a148\a147And what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story?\a148\a147I cannot tell, Mr. Holmes. There is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a deep green pool at the base of it. Perhaps in the depths of that pool\a151\a148\a147Well, well, it is of little consequence now. The case is closed.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 said the woman, \a147the case is closed.\a148We had risen to go, but there was something in the woman\a146s voice which arrested Holmes\a146s attention. He turned swiftly upon her.\a147Your life is not your own,\a148 he said. \a147Keep your hands off it.\a148\a147What use is it to anyone?\a148\a147How can you tell? The example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world.\a148The woman\a146s answer was a terrible one. She raised her veil and stepped forward into the light.\a147I wonder if you would bear it,\a148 she said.It was horrible. No words can describe the framework of a face when the face itself is gone. Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful. Holmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and together we left the room.Two days later, when I called upon my friend, he pointed with some pride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece. I picked it up. There was a red poison label. A pleasant almondy odour rose when I opened it.\a147Prussic acid?\a148 said 1.\a147Exactly. It came by post. \a145I send you my temptation. I will follow your advice.\a146 That was the message. I think, Watson, we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it.\a148\p\X1\BShoscombe Old Place\B\X1\c\i\m="SHOS-05.png"\i\cSherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph.\a147It is glue, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Unquestionably it is glue. Have a look at these scattered objects in the field!\a148I stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my vision.\a147Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. The irregular grey masses are dust. There are epithelial scales on the left. Those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue.\a148\a147Well,\a148 I said, laughing, \a147I am prepared to take your word for it. Does anything depend upon it?\a148\a147It is a very fine demonstration,\a148 he answered. \a147In the St. Pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman. The accused man denies that it is his. But he is a picture-frame maker who habitually handles glue.\a148\a147Is it one of your cases?\a148\a147No; my friend, Merivale, of the Yard, asked me to look into the case. Since I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope.\a148 He looked impatiently at his watch. \a147I had a new client calling, but he is overdue. By the way, Watson, you know something of racing?\a148\a147I ought to. I pay for it with about half my wound pension.\a148\a147Then I\a146ll make you my \a145Handy Guide to the Turf.\a146 What about Sir Robert Norberton? Does the name recall anything?\a148\a147Well, I should say so. He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. Norberton nearly came within your province once.\a148\a147How was that?\a148\a147It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known Curzon Street money-lender, on Newmarket Heath. He nearly killed the man.\a148\a147Ah, he sounds interesting! Does he often indulge in that way?\a148\a147Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. He is about the most daredevil rider in England\a151 second in the Grand National a few years back. He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. He should have been a buck in the days of the Regency\a151 a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all account, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back again.\a148\a147Capital, Watson! A thumb-nail sketch. I seem to know the man. Now, can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?\a148\a147Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.\a148\a147And the head trainer,\a148 said Holmes, \a147is John Mason. You need not look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which I am unfolding. But let us have some more about Shoscombe. I seem to have struck a rich vein.\a148\a147There are the Shoscombe spaniels,\a148 said I. \a147You hear of them at every dog show. The most exclusive breed in England. They are the special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.\a148\a147Sir Robert Norberton\a146s wife, I presume!\a148\a147Sir Robert has never married. Just as well, I think, considering his prospects. He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.\a148\a147You mean that she lives with him?\a148\a147No, no. The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James. Norberton has no claim on it at all. It is only a life interest and reverts to her husband\a146s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents every year.\a148\a147And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?\a148\a147That is about the size of it. He is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. Yet I have heard that she is devoted to him. But what is amiss at Shoscombe?\a148\a147Ah, that is just what I want to know. And here, I expect, is the man who can tell us.\a148The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many of both under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had waved him.\a147You had my note, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Yes, but it explained nothing.\a148\a147It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And too complicated. It was only face to face I could do it.\a148\a147Well, we are at your disposal.\a148\a147First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has gone mad.\a148Holmes raised his eyebrows. \a147This is Baker Street, not Harley Street,\a148 said he. \a147But why do you say so?\a148\a147Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby have turned his brain.\a148\a147That is a colt you are running?\a148\a147The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does. Now, I\a146ll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that it won\a146t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to win this Derby. He\a146s up to the neck, and it\a146s his last chance. Everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse\a151 and at fine odds, too! You can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.\a148\a147But how is that if the horse is so good?\a148\a147The public don\a146t know how good he is. Sir Robert has been too clever for the touts. He has the Prince\a146s half-brother out for spins. You can\a146t tell \a146em apart. But there are two lengths in a furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. He thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. His whole life is on it. He\a146s holding off the Jews till then. If the Prince fails him he is done.\a148\a147It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come in?\a148\a147Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. I don\a146t believe he sleeps at night. He is down at the stables at all hours. His eyes are wild. It has all been too much for his nerves. Then there is his conduct to Lady Beatrice!\a148\a147Ah! What is that?\a148\a147They have always been the best of friends. They had the same tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. Every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them\a151 and, above all, she loved the Prince. He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. But that\a146s all over now.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. For a week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as \a145Good-morning\a146! \a148\a147You think there has been a quarrel?\a148\a147And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. Why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? He gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green Dragon, three miles off, at Crendall.\a148\a147That certainly did seem strange.\a148\a147Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn\a146t expect that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her room. He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good friend to him. But that\a146s all over, too. He never goes near her. And she takes it to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr. Holmes\a151 drinking like a fish.\a148\a147Did she drink before this estrangement?\a148\a147Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It\a146s all changed, Mr. Holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. But then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night? And who is the man that meets him there?\a148Holmes rubbed his hands.\a147Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting.\a148\a147It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o\a146clock at night and raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough, master was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. He\a146s a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all light. It was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting for him there.\a148\a147What is this haunted crypt?\a148\a147Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. It is so old that nobody could fix its date. And under it there\a146s a crypt which has a bad name among us. It\a146s a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. But master\a146s not afraid. He never feared anything in his life. But what is he doing there in the night-time?\a148\a147Wait a bit!\a148 said Holmes. \a147You say there is another man there. It must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house! Surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?\a148\a147It\a146s no one I know.\a148\a147How can you say that?\a148\a147Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night. Sir Robert turned and passed us\a151 me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. But we could hear the other moving about behind. We were not afraid of him. So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please. \a145Hullo, mate! who may you be?\a146 says I. I guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. He could run!I\a146ll give him that. In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found.\a148\a147But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?\a148\a147Yes, I would swear to his yellow face\a151 a mean dog, I should say. What could he have in common with Sir Robert?\a148Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.\a147Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?\a148 he asked at last.\a147There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been with her this five years.\a148\a147And is, no doubt, devoted?\a148Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.\a147She\a146s devoted enough,\a148 he answered at last. \a147But I won\a146t say to whom.\a148\a147Ah!\a148 said Holmes.\a147I can\a146t tell tales out of school.\a148\a147I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear enough. From Dr. Watson\a146s description of Sir Robert I can realize that no woman is safe from him. Don\a146t you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there?\a148\a147Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.\a148\a147But she may not have seen it before. Let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out. She wants to get rid of the woman. Her brother will not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. The hated maid is still tied to her. The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. Does not all this hang together?\a148\a147Well, it might do\a151 so far as it goes.\a148\a147Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? We can\a146t fit that into our plot.\a148\a147No, sir, and there is something more that I can\a146t fit in. Why should Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?\a148Holmes sat up abruptly.\a147We only found it out yesterday\a151 after I had written to you. Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down to the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit of a human body.\a148\a147You informed the police, I suppose?\a148Our visitor smiled grimly.\a147Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. It was just the head and a few bones of a mummy. It may have been a thousand years old. But it wasn\a146t there before. That I\a146ll swear, and so will Stephens. It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that corner had always been empty before.\a148\a147What did you do with it?\a148\a147Well, we just left it there.\a148\a147That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. Has he returned?\a148\a147We expect him back to-day.\a148\a147When did Sir Robert give away his sister\a146s dog?\a148\a147It was just a week ago to-day. The creature was howling outside the old wellhouse, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning. He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it. Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at the Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again.\a148Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes.\a147I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr. Mason,\a148 he said at last. \a147Can\a146t you make it more definite?\a148\a147Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said our visitor.He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of bone.Holmes examined it with interest.\a147Where did you get it?\a148\a147There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady Beatrice\a146s room. It\a146s been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained of cold and had it on again.Harvey runs it\a151 he\a146s one of my lads. This very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders. He didn\a146t like the look of it.\a148\a147Nor do I,\a148 said Holmes. \a147What do you make of it, Watson?\a148It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance.\a147It\a146s the upper condyle of a human femur,\a148 said I.\a147Exactly!\a148 Holmes had become very serious. \a147When does this lad tend to the furnace?\a148\a147He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.\a148\a147Then anyone could visit it during the night?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Can you enter it from outside?\a148\a147There is one door from outside. There is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice\a146s room is situated.\a148\a147These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty. You say that Sir Robert was not at home last night?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.\a148\a147That\a146s true, sir.\a148\a147What is the name of that inn you spoke of?\a148\a147The Green Dragon.\a148\a147Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?\a148 The honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life.\a147Well, sir, I\a146ve heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike in the Hall lake.\a148\a147That\a146s good enough. Watson and I are famous fishermen\a151 are we not, Watson? You may address us in future at the Green Dragon. We should reach it to-night. I need not say that we don\a146t want to see you, Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I want you. When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will let you have a considered opinion.\a148Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little \a147halt-on-demand\a148 station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.\a147What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?\a148 said Holmes.The face of the innkeeper clouded.\a147That wouldn\a146t do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through.\a148\a147How\a146s that, then?\a148\a147It\a146s Sir Robert, sir. He\a146s terrible jealous of touts. If you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he\a146d be after you as sure as fate. He ain\a146t taking no chances, Sir Robert ain\a146t.\a148\a147I\a146ve heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.\a148\a147Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all our money for the race, and all Sir Robert\a146s into the bargain. By the way\a148he looked at us with thoughtful eyes\a147I suppose you ain\a146t on the turf yourselves?\a148\a147No, indeed. Just two weary Londoners who badly need some good Berkshire air.\a148\a147Well, you are in the right place for that. There is a deal of it lying about. But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. He\a146s the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the park.\a148\a147Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.\a148\a147I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There ain\a146t a better in England.\a148\a147I am a dog-fancier myself,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize dog like that cost?\a148\a147More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me this one. That\a146s why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.\a148\a147We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,\a148 said Holmes when the landlord had left us. \a147It\a146s not an easy one to play, but we may see our way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should like reassurance.\a148\a147Have you any theory, Holmes?\a148\a147Only this, Watson, that \isomething\i happened a week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is that something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They seem to be of a curiously mixed character. But that should surely help us. It is only the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.\a147Let us consider our data. The brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister. He gives away her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does that suggest nothing to you?\a148\a147Nothing but the brother\a146s spite.\a148\a147Well, it might be so. Or\a151 well, there is an alternative. Now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse and apparently takes to drink. That covers the case, does it not?\a148\a147Save for the business in the crypt.\a148\a147That is another line of thought. There are two, and I beg you will not tangle them. Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?\a148\a147I can make nothing of it.\a148\a147Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. He is mad keen upon winning the Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors. He is a daring and desperate man. He derives his income from his sister. His sister\a146s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?\a148\a147But the crypt?\a148\a147Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson\a151 it is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument\a146s sake\a151 that Sir Robert has done away with his sister.\a148\a147My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.\a148\a147Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock. But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for a moment argue upon this supposition. He could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he has still to stand his ground. To do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would impersonate her. With the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible. The woman\a146s body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen. What say you to that, Watson?\a148\a147Well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition.\a148\a147I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. We may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process.\a148In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. About eleven o\a146clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us.\a147This is the place,\a148 said he as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them. \a147About midday, Mr Barnes informs me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened. When it comes through, and before it gathers speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some question. Never mind me. I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see what I can see.\a148It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid, high-stepping grey carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the roadway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was able to get a good look at the occupants. A highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the highroad I held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. With a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above it.\a147Drive on! Drive on!\a148 shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the horses, and we were left standing in the roadway.\a147Well, Watson, that\a146s done it,\a148 said Holmes as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel. \a147He thought it was his mistress, and he found it was a stranger. Dogs don\a146t make mistakes.\a148\a147But it was the voice of a man!\a148 I cried.\a147Exactly! We have added one card to our hand, Watson, but it needs careful playing, all the same.\a148My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream with the result that we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was only after that meal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. Once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our London acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.\a147Good-evening, gentlemen,\a148 said he. \a147I got your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.\a148\a147How far is this crypt from the house?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147A good quarter of a mile.\a148\a147Then I think we can disregard him altogether.\a148\a147I can\a146t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.\a148\a147I see! In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason. You can show us the crypt and then leave us.\a148It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the grass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel. We entered the broken gap which was once the porch, and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the crypt. Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy place\a151 dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of Death.\a147You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could you show them before you go?\a148\a147They are here in this corner.\a148 The trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. \a147They are gone,\a148 said he.\a147So I expected,\a148 said Holmes, chuckling. \a147I fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part.\a148\a147But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years?\a148 asked John Mason.\a147That is what we are here to find out,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It may mean a long search, and we need not detain you. I fancy that we shall get our solution before morning.\a148When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman Hugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the eighteenth century. It was an hour or more before Holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. I heard his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. With his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a couple of clamps. There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption.Someone was walking in the chapel above. It was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon which he walked. A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. A large stable-lantern which he held in front of him shone upward upon a strong, heavily moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my companion and myself.\a147Who the devil are you?\a148 he thundered. \a147And what are you doing upon my property?\a148 Then, as Holmes returned no answer he took a couple of steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. \a147Do you hear me?\a148 he cried. \a147Who are you? What are you doing here?\a148 His cudgel quivered in the air.But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to meet him.\a147I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,\a148 he said in his sternest tone. \a147Who is this? And what is it doing here?\a148He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. In the glare of the lantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot with dreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face.The baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against a stone sarcophagus.\a147How came you to know of this?\a148 he cried. And then, with some return of his truculent manner: \a147What business is it of yours?\a148\a147My name is Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said my companion. \a147 Possibly it is familiar to you. In any case, my business is that of every other good citizen\a151 to uphold the law. It seems to me that you have much to answer for.\a148Sir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes\a146s quiet voice and cool, assured manner had their effect.\a147\a160\a145Fore God, Mr. Holmes, it\a146s all right,\a148 said he. \a147 Appearances are against me, I\a146ll admit, but I could act no otherwise.\a148\a147I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be before the police.\a148Sir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders.\a147Well, if it must be, it must. Come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands.\a148A quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of the old house. It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left us for a few moments. When he returned he had two companions with him; the one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the other, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. These two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken.\a147There,\a148 said Sir Robert with a wave of his hand, \a147are Mr. and Mrs. Norlett. Mrs. Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some years been my sister\a146s confidential maid. I have brought them here because I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I say.\a148\a147Is this necessary, Sir Robert? Have you thought what you are doing?\a148 cried the woman.\a147As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,\a148 said her husband.Sir Robert gave him a glance of contempt. \a147I will take all responsibility,\a148 said he. \a147Now, Mr. Holmes, listen to a plain statement of the facts.\a147You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not have found you where I did. Therefore, you know already, in all probability, that I am running a dark horse for the Derby and that everything depends upon my success. If I win, all is easy. If I lose\a151 well, I dare not think of that!\a148\a147I understand the position,\a148 said Holmes.\a147I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything. But it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only. For myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews. I have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures. Everything would be seized\a151 my stables, my horses\a151 everything. Well, Mr. Holmes, my sister \idid\i die just a week ago.\a148\a147And you told no one!\a148\a147What could I do? Absolute ruin faced me. If I could stave things off for three weeks all would be well. Her maid\a146s husband\a151 this man here\a151 is an actor. It came into our heads\a151 it came into my head\a151 that he could for that short period personate my sister. It was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the maid. It was not difficult to arrange. My sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her.\a148\a147That will be for a coroner to decide.\a148\a147Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end.\a148\a147Well, what did you do?\a148\a147The body could not remain there. On the first night Norlett and I carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. We were followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the door, so I felt some safer place was needed. I got rid of the spaniel, and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. There was no indignity or irreverence, Mr. Holmes. I do not feel that I have wronged the dead.\a148\a147Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.\a148The baronet shook his head impatiently. \a147It is easy to preach,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position. One cannot see all one\a146s hopes and all one\a146s plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them. It seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband\a146s ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground. We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and placed her as you have seen her. As to the old relics which we took out, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. Norlett and I removed them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace. There is my story, Mr. Holmes, though how you forced my hand so that I have to tell it is more than I can say.\a148Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.\a147There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,\a148 he said at last. \a147Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate.\a148\a147The horse would be part of the estate. What do they care for my bets? As likely as not they would not run him at all. My chief creditor is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy\a151 a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer, whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath. Do you suppose that he would try to save me?\a148\a147Well, Sir Robert,\a148 said Holmes, rising, \a147this matter must, of course, be referred to the police. It was my duty to bring the facts to light, and there I must leave it. As to the morality or decency of your conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. It is nearly midnight, Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble abode.\a148It is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a happier note than Sir Robert\a146s actions deserved. Shoscombe Prince did win the Derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over, when they were paid in full, and enough was left to reestablish Sir Robert in a fair position in life. Both police and coroner took a lenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay in registering the lady\a146s decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age.\p\X1\BSir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\X1Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in Edinburgh and sent to the Jesuit preparatory school Stonyhurst at the age of nine, and by the time he left the school in 1875 he rejected Christianity to become an agnostic. From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at Edinburgh University, including a period working in the town of Aston (now a district of Birmingham). Following his term at University he served as a ship\a146s doctor on a voyage to the West African coast, and then in 1882 he set up a practice in Plymouth. He won his doctorate in 1885. His medical practice was unsuccessful; while waiting for patients he began writing stories. His first literary experience came in Chambers\a146s Edinburgh Journal before he was twenty.It was only after he subsequently moved his practice to Southsea that he began to indulge more extensively in literature. His first significant work was A Study in Scarlet which appeared in Beeton\a146s Christmas Annual for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes.In 1885 he married Louise Hawkins, who suffered from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1906. He married Miss Jean Leckie in 1907, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897 but had maintained a platonic relationship with out of loyalty to his first wife. Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (Mary and Kingsley), and three with his second wife (Jean, Denis, and Adrian).In 1890 Doyle studied the eye in Vienna, and in 1891 moved to London to set up a practice as an oculist. This also gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: \a147I think of slaying Holmes\a133 and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.\a148 In December 1893 he did so, with Holmes and his arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty apparently plunging to their deaths together over a waterfall in the story \a147The Final Problem\a148. Public outcry led him to bring the character back. Doyle returned to the story in \a147The Adventure of the Empty House\a148, saying that only Moriarty had fallen, but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had arranged to be temporarily \a147dead\a148 also. Holmes eventually appeared in 56 short stories and four of Doyle\a146s novels (he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors, as well).Following the Boer War in South Africa at the turn of the century and the condemnation from around the world over Britain\a146s conduct, Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct which was widely translated. Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted and appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey in 1902. He also wrote the longer book The Great Boer War in 1900. During the early years of the twentieth century Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a Liberal Unionist, once in Edinburgh and once in the Border Burghs, but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected. He did, however, become one of the first Honorary Members of the Ski Club of Great Britain.Conan Doyle was involved even in the campaign for the reform of the Congo Free State, lead by the journalist Edmund Dene Morel and the diplomat Roger Casement. He wrote The Crime of the Congo in 1908, a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in Congo. He become acquainted with Morel and Casement, taking even inspiration by them for two of the main character of the novel The Lost World (1912). He broke with both, however, with the first world war, when Morel (who was rather left-wing) became one of the leaders of the pacifist movement and Casement betrayed England for his Irish nationalistic views. He, however, tried to save Casement from death penalty, arguing that he had driven mad and was not responsible of his act.Doyle also caused two cases to be reopened. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji, who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were dead set on Edalji\a146s guilt, even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed. It was partially as a result of this case that the Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907, so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped to establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice. The second case, that of Oscar Slater, a German Jew and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in 1908 excited Doyle\a146s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed. It is not known whether either enjoyed the same resolution as Holmes\a146 clients.In his later years, Doyle became involved with Spiritualism, to the extent that he wrote a Professor Challenger novel on the subject, The Land of Mist. One of the odder aspects of this involvement was his book The Coming of the Fairies (1921): He was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the Cottingley fairy photographs, which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 under the pretence of occultism.\p\X1\BSources & Acknowledgements\B\X1I would like to thank Olivia Adler for permission to use the excellent images from the Pinacotheca Holmesiana website within each book.The text is mostly from the University of Adelaide\a146s Open Sources with Project Gutenburg sources used for reference.The text of the Arthur Conan Doyle biography is from Wikipedia.
