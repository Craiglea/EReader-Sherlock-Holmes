WATSON, M.D., late of the Army Medical Department\i\c\BChapter 1\B - \X2\BMr Sherlock Holmes\B\X2In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy\a146s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship \iOrontes\i, and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air\a151 or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.\a147Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\a148 he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. \a147You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\a148I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.\a147Poor devil!\a148 he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. \a147What are you up to now?\a148\a147Looking for lodgings.\a148 I answered. \a147Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\a148\a147That\a146s a strange thing,\a148 remarked my companion; \a147you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.\a148\a147And who was the first?\a148 I asked.\a147A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.\a148\a147By Jove!\a148 I cried, \a147if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.\a148Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \a147You don\a146t know Sherlock Holmes yet,\a148 he said; \a147perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.\a148\a147Why, what is there against him?\a148\a147Oh, I didn\a146t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas\a151 an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.\a148\a147A medical student, I suppose?\a148 said I.\a147No\a151 I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\a148\a147Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\a148 I asked.\a147No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\a148\a147I should like to meet him,\a148 I said. \a147If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?\a148\a147He is sure to be at the laboratory,\a148 returned my companion. \a147He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\a148\a147Certainly,\a148 I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.\a147You mustn\a146t blame me if you don\a146t get on with him,\a148 he said; \a147I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.\a148\a147If we don\a146t get on it will be easy to part company,\a148 I answered. \a147It seems to me, Stamford,\a148 I added, looking hard at my companion, \a147that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow\a146s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don\a146t be mealy-mouthed about it.\a148\a147It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\a148 he answered with a laugh. \a147Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes\a151 it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\a148\a147Very right too.\a148\a147Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.\a148\a147Beating the subjects!\a148\a147Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.\a148\a147And yet you say he is not a medical student?\a148\a147No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\a148 As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \a147I\a146ve found it. I\a146ve found it,\a148 he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. \a147I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else.\a148 Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\a147Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said Stamford, introducing us.\a147How are you?\a148 he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. \a147You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\a148\a147How on earth did you know that?\a148 I asked in astonishment.\a147Never mind,\a148 said he, chuckling to himself. \a147The question now is about haemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?\a148\a147It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\a148 I answered, \a147but practically\a151\a151\a148\a147Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don\a146t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!\a148 He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \a147Let us have some fresh blood,\a148 he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \a147Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\a148 As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.\a147Ha! ha!\a148 he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \a147What do you think of that?\a148\a147It seems to be a very delicate test,\a148 I remarked.\a147Beautiful! beautiful. The old Guaiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148 I murmured.\a147Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they. That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why. Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes\a146 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\a148His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.\a147You are to be congratulated,\a148 I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.\a147There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.\a148\a147You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\a148 said Stamford with a laugh. \a147You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \a145Police News of the Past.\a146\a160\a148\a147Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. \a147I have to be careful,\a148 he continued, turning to me with a smile, \a147for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\a148 He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\a147We came here on business,\a148 said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. \a147My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.\a148Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. \a147I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\a148 he said, \a147which would suit us down to the ground. You don\a146t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?\a148\a147I always smoke \a145ship\a146s\a146 myself,\a148 I answered.\a147That\a146s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147Let me see\a151 what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don\a146t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I\a146ll soon be right. What have you to confess now. It\a146s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\a148I laughed at this cross-examination. \a147I keep a bull pup,\a148 I said, \a147and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I\a146m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\a148\a147Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\a148 he asked, anxiously.\a147It depends on the player,\a148 I answered. \a147A well-played violin is a treat for the gods\a151 a badly-played one\a151\a151\a148\a147Oh, that\a146s all right,\a148 he cried, with a merry laugh. \a147I think we may consider the thing as settled\a151 that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.\a148\a147When shall we see them?\a148\a147Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\a146ll go together and settle everything,\a148 he answered.\a147All right\a151 noon exactly,\a148 said I, shaking his hand.We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.\a147By the way,\a148 I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \a147how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\a148My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \a147That\a146s just his little peculiarity,\a148 he said. \a147A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.\a148\a147Oh! a mystery is it?\a148 I cried, rubbing my hands. \a147This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \a145The proper study of mankind is man,\a146 you know.\a148\a147You must study him, then,\a148 Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. \a147You\a146ll find him a knotty problem, though. I\a146ll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye.\a148\a147Good-bye,\a148 I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.\p\BChapter II - \X2The Science Of Deduction\B\X2We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgement, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\a146s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognised portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the na\a212vest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilised human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\a147You appear to be astonished,\a148 he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \a147Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\a148\a147To forget it!\a148\a147You see,\a148 he explained, \a147I consider that a man\a146s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\a148\a147But the Solar System!\a148 I protested.\a147What the deuce is it to me?\a148 he interrupted impatiently; \a147you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\a148I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way\a151SHERLOCK HOLMES\a151 his limits.1\t. Knowledge of Literature.\a151 Nil.\t2\t. Philosophy.\a151 Nil.\t3\t. Astronomy.\a151 Nil.\t4\t. Politics.\a151 Feeble.\t5\t. Botany.\a151 Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\t6\t. Geology.\a151 Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them.\t7\t. Chemistry.\a151 Profound.\t8\t. Anatomy.\a151 Accurate, but unsystematic.\t9\t. Sensational Literature.\a151 Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century.\t1\t0. Plays the violin well.\t1\t1. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\t1\t2. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\tWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. \a147If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\a148 I said to myself, \a147I may as well give up the attempt at once.\a148I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn\a146s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognised air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologised to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \a147I have to use this room as a place of business,\a148 he said, \a147and these people are my clients.\a148 Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.Its somewhat ambitious title was \a147The Book of Life,\a148 and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\a146s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\a147From a drop of water,\a148 said the writer, \a147a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\a146s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs\a151 by each of these things a man\a146s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\a148\a147What ineffable twaddle!\a148 I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, \a147I never read such rubbish in my life.\a148\a147What is it?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes.\a147Why, this article,\a148 I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. \a147I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don\a146t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\a148\a147You would lose your money,\a148 Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \a147As for the article I wrote it myself.\a148\a147You!\a148\a147Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical\a151 so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\a148\a147And how?\a148 I asked involuntarily.\a147Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I\a146m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\a146t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\a148\a147And these other people?\a148\a147They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.\a148\a147But do you mean to say,\a148 I said, \a147that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?\a148\a147Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\a148\a147You were told, no doubt.\a148\a147Nothing of the sort. I \iknew\i you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \a145Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded. Clearly in Afghanistan.\a146 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\a148\a147It is simple enough as you explain it,\a148 I said, smiling. \a147You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe\a146s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.\a148Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \a147No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\a148 he observed. \a147Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends\a146 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour\a146s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\a148\a147Have you read Gaboriau\a146s works?\a148 I asked. \a147Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?\a148Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \a147Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\a148 he said, in an angry voice; \a147he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\a148I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. \a147This fellow may be very clever,\a148 I said to myself, \a147but he is certainly very conceited.\a148\a147There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\a148 he said, querulously. \a147What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result. There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.\a148I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.\a147I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\a148 I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.\a147You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes.\a147Brag and bounce!\a148 thought I to myself. \a147He knows that I cannot verify his guess.\a148The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.\a147For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. \a147May I ask, my lad,\a148 I said, in the blandest voice, \a147what your trade may be?\a148\a147Commissionaire, sir,\a148 he said, gruffly. \a147Uniform away for repairs.\a148\a147And you were?\a148 I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.\a147A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer. Right, sir.\a148He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.\p\BChapter III\B - \X2\BThe Lauriston Garden Mystery\B\X2I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion\a146s theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\a147How in the world did you deduce that?\a148 I asked.\a147Deduce what?\a148 said he, petulantly.\a147Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\a148\a147I have no time for trifles,\a148 he answered, brusquely; then with a smile, \a147Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?\a148\a147No, indeed.\a148\a147It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow\a146s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him\a151 all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Commonplace,\a148 said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \a147I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong\a151 look at this!\a148 He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.\a148\a147Why,\a148 I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \a147this is terrible!\a148\a147It does seem to be a little out of the common,\a148 he remarked, calmly. \a147Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\a148This is the letter which I read to him\a151\a151\a147MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\a147There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of \a145Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\a146 There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything \iin statu quo\i until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully. \a147TOBIAS GREGSON.\a148\a147Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\a148 my friend remarked; \a147he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional\a151 shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.\a148I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \a147Surely there is not a moment to be lost,\a148 I cried, \a147shall I go and order you a cab?\a148\a147I\a146m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather\a151 that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.\a148\a147Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\a148\a147My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\a148\a147But he begs you to help him.\a148\a147Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\a148He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\a147Get your hat,\a148 he said.\a147You wish me to come?\a148\a147Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\a148 A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\a147You don\a146t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\a148 I said at last, interrupting Holmes\a146 musical disquisition.\a147No data yet,\a148 he answered. \a147It is a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgement.\a148\a147You will have your data soon,\a148 I remarked, pointing with my finger; \a147this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.\a148\a147So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\a148 We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \a147To Let\a148 card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion\a146s hand with effusion. \a147It is indeed kind of you to come,\a148 he said, \a147I have had everything left untouched.\a148\a147Except that!\a148 my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \a147If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.\a148\a147I have had so much to do inside the house,\a148 the detective said evasively. \a147My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.\a148Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \a147With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,\a148 he said.Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \a147I think we have done all that can be done,\a148 he answered; \a147it\a146s a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.\a148\a147You did not come here in a cab?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes.\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Nor Lestrade?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Then let us go and look at the room.\a148 With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment.A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.\a147This case will make a stir, sir,\a148 he remarked. \a147It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.\a148\a147There is no clue?\a148 said Gregson.\a147None at all,\a148 chimed in Lestrade.Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \a147You are sure that there is no wound?\a148 he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\a147Positive!\a148 cried both detectives.\a147Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual\a151 presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year \a14634. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Read it up\a151 you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.\a148As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man\a146s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\a147He has not been moved at all?\a148 he asked.\a147No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\a148\a147You can take him to the mortuary now,\a148 he said. \a147There is nothing more to be learned.\a148Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\a147There\a146s been a woman here,\a148 he cried. \a147It\a146s a woman\a146s wedding-ring.\a148He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\a147This complicates matters,\a148 said Gregson. \a147Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.\a148\a147You\a146re sure it doesn\a146t simplify them?\a148 observed Holmes. \a147There\a146s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?\a148\a147We have it all here,\a148 said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \a147A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin\a151 bull-dog\a146s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio\a146s \a145Decameron,\a146 with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters\a151 one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.\a148\a147At what address?\a148\a147American Exchange, Strand\a151 to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.\a148\a147Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\a148\a147I did it at once, sir,\a148 said Gregson. \a147I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet.\a148\a147Have you sent to Cleveland?\a148\a147We telegraphed this morning.\a148\a147How did you word your inquiries?\a148\a147We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.\a148\a147You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?\a148\a147I asked about Stangerson.\a148\a147Nothing else. Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge. Will you not telegraph again?\a148\a147I have said all I have to say,\a148 said Gregson, in an offended voice.Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\a147Mr. Gregson,\a148 he said, \a147I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.\a148The little man\a146s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.\a147Come here,\a148 he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \a147Now, stand there!\a148He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\a147Look at that!\a148 he said, triumphantly.I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word\a151\c\iRACHE.\i\c\a147What do you think of that?\a148 cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \a147This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall. That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on. I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.\a148\a147And what does it mean now that you \ihave\i found it?\a148 asked Gregson in a deprecatory voice.\a147Mean. Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\a146s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\a148\a147I really beg your pardon!\a148 said my companion, who had ruffled the little man\a146s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \a147You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night\a146s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\a148As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\a147They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\a148 he remarked with a smile. \a147It\a146s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.\a148Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes\a146 smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.\a147What do you think of it, sir?\a148 they both asked.\a147It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,\a148 remarked my friend. \a147You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\a148 There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \a147If you will let me know how your investigations go,\a148 he continued, \a147I shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\a148Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \a147John Rance,\a148 he said. \a147He is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\a148Holmes took a note of the address.\a147Come along, Doctor,\a148 he said; \a147we shall go and look him up. I\a146ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\a148 he continued, turning to the two detectives. \a147There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.\a148Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\a147If this man was murdered, how was it done?\a148 asked the former.\a147Poison,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \a147One other thing, Lestrade,\a148 he added, turning round at the door: \a147\a160\a145Rache\a146 is the German for \a145revenge\a146; so don\a146t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\a148With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.\p\BChapter IV - \X2What John Rance Had To Tell\B\X2It was one o\a146clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.\a147There is nothing like first hand evidence,\a148 he remarked; \a147as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\a148\a147You amaze me, Holmes,\a148 said I. \a147Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\a148\a147There\a146s no room for a mistake,\a148 he answered. \a147The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\a146s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning\a151 I have Gregson\a146s word for that\a151 it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\a148\a147That seems simple enough,\a148 said I; \a147but how about the other man\a146s height?\a148\a147Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\a146s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\a146s play.\a148\a147And his age?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can\a146t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\a148\a147The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\a148 I suggested.\a147The writing on the wall was done with a man\a146s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\a146s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey\a151 such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes\a151 in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\a148\a147And the florid face?\a148 I asked.\a147Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\a148I passed my hand over my brow. \a147My head is in a whirl,\a148 I remarked; \a147the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men\a151 if there were two men\a151 into an empty house. What has become of the cabman who drove them. How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from. What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it. How came the woman\a146s ring there. Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping. I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.\a148My companion smiled approvingly.\a147You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\a148 he said. \a147There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\a146s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I\a146m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\a148\a147I shall never do that,\a148 I answered; \a147you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\a148My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\a147I\a146ll tell you one other thing,\a148 he said. \a147Patent leathers and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible\a151 arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room\a151 or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\a146ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Hall\a200\a146s concert to hear Norman-Neruda this afternoon.\a148This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \a147That\a146s Audley Court in there,\a148 he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \a147You\a146ll find me here when you come back.\a148Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. \a147I made my report at the office,\a148 he said.Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. \a147We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,\a148 he said.\a147I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\a148 the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\a147Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\a148Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative.\a147I\a146ll tell it ye from the beginning,\a148 he said. \a147My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the \a145White Hart\a146; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\a146clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher\a151 him who has the Holland Grove beat\a151 and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\a146. Presently\a151 maybe about two or a little after\a151 I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\a146 down, thinkin\a146 between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won\a146t have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\a146 typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door\a151\a151\a148\a147You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\a148 my companion interrupted. \a147What did you do that for?\a148Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his features.\a147Why, that\a146s true, sir,\a148 he said; \a147though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I\a146d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain\a146t afeared of anything on this side o\a146 the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o\a146 the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\a146 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\a146s lantern, but there wasn\a146t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\a148\a147There was no one in the street?\a148\a147Not a livin\a146 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\a146. There was a candle flickerin\a146 on the mantelpiece\a151 a red wax one\a151 and by its light I saw\a151\a151\a148\a147Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then\a151\a151\a148John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes. \a147Where was you hid to see all that?\a148 he cried. \a147It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.\a148Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. \a147Don\a146t get arresting me for the murder,\a148 he said. \a147I am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next?\a148Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. \a147I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\a148\a147Was the street empty then?\a148\a147Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\a148\a147What do you mean?\a148The constable\a146s features broadened into a grin. \a147I\a146ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,\a148 he said, \a147but never anyone so cryin\a146 drunk as that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\a146 up agin the railings, and a-singin\a146 at the pitch o\a146 his lungs about Columbine\a146s New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\a146t stand, far less help.\a148\a147What sort of a man was he?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes.John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \a147He was an uncommon drunk sort o\a146 man,\a148 he said. \a147He\a146d ha\a146 found hisself in the station if we hadn\a146t been so took up.\a148\a147His face\a151 his dress\a151 didn\a146t you notice them?\a148 Holmes broke in impatiently.\a147I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up\a151 me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round\a151\a151\a148\a147That will do,\a148 cried Holmes. \a147What became of him?\a148\a147We\a146d enough to do without lookin\a146 after him,\a148 the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice. \a147I\a146ll wager he found his way home all right.\a148\a147How was he dressed?\a148\a147A brown overcoat.\a148\a147Had he a whip in his hand?\a148\a147A whip\a151 no.\a148\a147He must have left it behind,\a148 muttered my companion. \a147You didn\a146t happen to see or hear a cab after that?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147There\a146s a half-sovereign for you,\a148 my companion said, standing up and taking his hat. \a147I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant\a146s stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\a148We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.\a147The blundering fool,\a148 Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. \a147Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.\a148\a147I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he come back to the house after leaving it. That is not the way of criminals.\a148\a147The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have him, Doctor\a151 I\a146ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldn\a146t we use a little art jargon. There\a146s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman-Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are splendid. What\a146s that little thing of Chopin\a146s she plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\a148Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\p\BChapter V\B - \X2\BOur Advertisement Brings A Visitor\B\X2Our morning\a146s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\a146 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\a146 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognised that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\a146s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\a146s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation. But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor. There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.He was very late in returning\a151 so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared.\a147It was magnificent,\a148 he said, as he took his seat. \a147Do you remember what Darwin says about music. He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.\a148\a147That\a146s rather a broad idea,\a148 I remarked.\a147One\a146s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,\a148 he answered. \a147What\a146s the matter? You\a146re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\a148\a147To tell the truth, it has,\a148 I said. \a147I ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.\a148\a147I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\a146s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Look at this advertisement,\a148 he answered. \a147I had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair.\a148He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the \a147Found\a148 column. \a147In Brixton Road, this morning,\a148 it ran, \a147a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the \a145White Hart\a146 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\a148\a147Excuse my using your name,\a148 he said. \a147If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognise it, and want to meddle in the affair.\a148\a147That is all right,\a148 I answered. \a147But supposing anyone applies, I have no ring.\a148\a147Oh yes, you have,\a148 said he, handing me one. \a147This will do very well. It is almost a facsimile.\a148\a147And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\a148\a147Why, the man in the brown coat\a151 our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\a148\a147Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\a148\a147Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\a146s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man\a146s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then. He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?\a148\a147And then?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\a148\a147I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\a148\a147You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.\a148I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\a147The plot thickens,\a148 he said, as I entered; \a147I have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\a148\a147And that is?\a148 I asked eagerly.\a147My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\a148 he remarked. \a147Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don\a146t frighten him by looking at him too hard.\a148\a147It is eight o\a146clock now,\a148 I said, glancing at my watch.\a147Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you. This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday\iDe Jure inter Gentes\ipublished in Latin at Li\a203ge in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles\a146 head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off.\a148\a147Who is the printer?\a148\a147Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very faded ink, is written \a145Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\a146 I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\a148As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.\a147Does Dr. Watson live here?\a148 asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant\a146s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.\a147Come in,\a148 I cried.At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement. \a147It\a146s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\a148 she said, dropping another curtsey; \a147a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\a146d say if he come \a145ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o\a146 times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with\a151\a151\a148\a147Is that her ring?\a148 I asked.\a147The Lord be thanked!\a148 cried the old woman; \a147Sally will be a glad woman this night. That\a146s the ring.\a148\a147And what may your address be?\a148 I inquired, taking up a pencil.\a14713, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\a148\a147The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes sharply.The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes. \a147The gentleman asked me for \imy\i address,\a148 she said. \a147Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\a148\a147And your name is\a151\a151?\a148\a147My name is Sawyer\a151 her\a146s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her\a151 and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he\a146s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops\a151\a151\a148\a147Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\a148 I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion; \a147it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\a148With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. \a147I\a146ll follow her,\a148 he said, hurriedly; \a147she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\a148 The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. \a147Either his whole theory is incorrect,\a148 I thought to myself, \a147or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.\a148 There was no need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until I heard the result of his adventure.It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri Murger\a146s \iVie de Boh\a203me\i. Ten o\a146clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.\a147I wouldn\a146t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\a148 he cried, dropping into his chair; \a147I have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.\a148\a147What is it then?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, I don\a146t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, \a145Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,\a146 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That\a146s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.\a148\a147You don\a146t mean to say,\a148 I cried, in amazement, \a147that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?\a148\a147Old woman be damned!\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \a147We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice and turn in.\a148I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.\p\BChapter VI\B - \X2\BTobias Gregson Shows What He Can Do\B\X2The papers next day were full of the \a147Brixton Mystery,\a148 as they termed it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:\a151The \iDaily Telegraph\i remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.The \iStandard\i commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\a146s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.The \iDaily News\i observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded\a151 a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\a147I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.\a148\a147That depends on how it turns out.\a148\a147Oh, bless you, it doesn\a146t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be \ion account\i of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be \iin spite\i of their exertions. It\a146s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. \a145Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l\a146admire.\a146\a160\a148\a147What on earth is this?\a148 I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\a147It\a146s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\a148 said my companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.\a147\a160\a145Tention!\a148 cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \a147In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\a148\a147No, sir, we hain\a146t,\a148 said one of the youths.\a147I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages. He handed each of them a shilling. \a147Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\a148He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\a147There\a146s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,\a148 Holmes remarked. \a147The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men\a146s lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation.\a148\a147Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\a148 I asked.\a147Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance. Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!\a148There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.\a147My dear fellow,\a148 he cried, wringing Holmes\a146 unresponsive hand, \a147congratulate me. I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\a148A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\a146s expressive face.\a147Do you mean that you are on the right track?\a148 he asked.\a147The right track. Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\a148\a147And his name is?\a148\a147Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\a146s navy,\a148 cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\a147Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,\a148 he said. \a147We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\a148\a147I don\a146t mind if I do,\a148 the detective answered. \a147The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.\a148\a147You do me too much honour,\a148 said Holmes, gravely. \a147Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.\a148The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.\a147The fun of it is,\a148 he cried, \a147that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time.\a148The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\a147And how did you get your clue?\a148\a147Ah, I\a146ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American\a146s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson\a146s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?\a148\a147Yes,\a148 said Holmes; \a147by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\a148Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.\a147I had no idea that you noticed that,\a148 he said. \a147Have you been there?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Ha!\a148 cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \a147you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem.\a148\a147To a great mind, nothing is little,\a148 remarked Holmes, sententiously.\a147Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\a146s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\a148\a147Smart\a151 very smart!\a148 murmured Sherlock Holmes.\a147I next called upon Madame Charpentier,\a148 continued the detective. \a147I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too\a151 an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn\a146t escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent\a151 a kind of thrill in your nerves. \a145Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?\a146 I asked.\a147The mother nodded. She didn\a146t seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.\a147\a160\a145At what o\a146clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145At eight o\a146clock,\a146 she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation. \a145His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains\a151 one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.\a147\a160\a145And was that the last which you saw of him?\a146\a147A terrible change came over the woman\a146s face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word \a145Yes\a146and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.\a147There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.\a147\a160\a145No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,\a146 she said. \a145Let us be frank with this gentleman. We \idid\i see Mr. Drebber again.\a146\a147\a160\a145God forgive you!\a146 cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. \a145You have murdered your brother.\a146\a147\a160\a145Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,\a146 the girl answered firmly.\a147\a160\a145You had best tell me all about it now,\a146 I said. \a145Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.\a146\a147\a160\a145On your head be it, Alice!\a146 cried her mother; and then, turning to me, \a145I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\a146\a147\a160\a145Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\a146 I answered. \a145Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\a146\a147\a160\a145Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\a146 she said, and her daughter withdrew. \a145Now, sir,\a146 she continued, \a145I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is your wisest course,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a \a147Copenhagen\a148 label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\a146clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her\a151 an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.\a146\a147\a160\a145But why did you stand all this,\a146 I asked. \a145I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.\a146\a147Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \a145Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,\a146 she said. \a145But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each\a151 fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well?\a146\a147\a160\a145My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. \a147You are of age,\a148 he said, \a147and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.\a148 Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \a147I don\a146t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\a148 he said. \a147I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.\a148 With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\a146s mysterious death.\a146\a147This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\a146s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake.\a148\a147It\a146s quite exciting,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \a147What happened next?\a148\a147When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\a148 the detective continued, \a147I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.\a147\a160\a145I do not know,\a146 she answered.\a147\a160\a145Not know?\a146\a147\a160\a145No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.\a146\a147\a160\a145After you went to bed?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145When did you go to bed?\a146\a147\a160\a145About eleven.\a146\a147\a160\a145So your son was gone at least two hours?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145Possibly four or five?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145What was he doing during that time?\a146\a147\a160\a145I do not know,\a146 she answered, turning white to her very lips.\a147Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \a145I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,\a146 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\a148\a147Very,\a148 said Holmes.\a147He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\a148\a147What is your theory, then?\a148\a147Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.\a148\a147Well done!\a148 said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \a147Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\a148\a147I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\a148 the detective answered proudly. \a147The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won\a146t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here\a146s the very man himself!\a148It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \a147This is a most extraordinary case,\a148 he said at last\a147a most incomprehensible affair.\a148\a147Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\a148 cried Gregson, triumphantly. \a147I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\a148\a147The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\a148 said Lestrade gravely, \a147was murdered at Halliday\a146s Private Hotel about six o\a146clock this morning.\a148\p\BChapter VII\B - \X2\BLight In The Darkness\B\X2The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfounded. Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.\a147Stangerson too!\a148 he muttered. \a147The plot thickens.\a148\a147It was quite thick enough before,\a148 grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. \a147I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\a148\a147Are you\a151 are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\a148 stammered Gregson.\a147I have just come from his room,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147I was the first to discover what had occurred.\a148\a147We have been hearing Gregson\a146s view of the matter,\a148 Holmes observed. \a147Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\a148\a147I have no objection,\a148 Lestrade answered, seating himself. \a147I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.\a148\a147They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o\a146clock I reached Halliday\a146s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative.\a147\a160\a145No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\a146 they said. \a145He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where is he now?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\a146\a147\a160\a145I will go up and see him at once,\a146 I said.\a147It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\a146 experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognised him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\a148I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.\a147The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\a148 he said.\a147That was it,\a148 said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while.There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it.\a147The man was seen,\a148 continued Lestrade. \a147A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\a148I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face.\a147Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?\a148 he asked.\a147Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber\a146s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man\a146s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, \a145J. H. is in Europe.\a146 There was no name appended to this message.\a148\a147And there was nothing else?\a148 Holmes asked.\a147Nothing of any importance. The man\a146s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\a148Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\a147The last link,\a148 he cried, exultantly. \a147My case is complete.\a148The two detectives stared at him in amazement.\a147I have now in my hands,\a148 my companion said, confidently, \a147all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\a148\a147I have them,\a148 said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \a147I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.\a148\a147Give them here,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, Doctor,\a148 turning to me, \a147are those ordinary pills?\a148They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. \a147From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\a148 I remarked.\a147Precisely so,\a148 answered Holmes. \a147Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\a148I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. It\a146s laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.\a147I will now cut one of these pills in two,\a148 said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. \a147One half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\a148\a147This may be very interesting,\a148 said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \a147I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\a148\a147Patience, my friend, patience. You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.\a148As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes\a146 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met.\a147It can\a146t be a coincidence,\a148 he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \a147it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean. Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible. And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it. I have it!\a148 With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature\a146s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \a147I should have more faith,\a148 he said; \a147I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\a148This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\a147All this seems strange to you,\a148 continued Holmes, \a147because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those \ioutr\a200\i and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\a148Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. \a147Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 he said, \a147we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it?\a148\a147I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\a148 remarked Lestrade. \a147We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\a148\a147Any delay in arresting the assassin,\a148 I observed, \a147might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\a148Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\a147There will be no more murders,\a148 he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. \a147You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\a148Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other\a146s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\a147Please, sir,\a148 he said, touching his forelock, \a147I have the cab downstairs.\a148\a147Good boy,\a148 said Holmes, blandly. \a147Why don\a146t you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard?\a148 he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer. \a147See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.\a148\a147The old pattern is good enough,\a148 remarked Lestrade, \a147if we can only find the man to put them on.\a148\a147Very good, very good,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\a148I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.\a147Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\a148 he said, kneeling over his task, and never turning his head.The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\a147Gentlemen,\a148 he cried, with flashing eyes, \a147let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\a148The whole thing occurred in a moment\a151 so quickly that I had no time to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\a146 triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\a146s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\a146s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\a147We have his cab,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147It will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\a148 he continued, with a pleasant smile, \a147we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.\a148\p\X1\c\BPart 2\X1 - The Country of the Saints\B\c\BChapter I\B - \X2\BOn The Great Alkali Plain\B\X2In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth\a151 above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence\a151 complete and heart-subduing silence.It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them. They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying\a151 dying from hunger and from thirst.He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \a147Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\a148 he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\a147You\a146ve hurt me!\a148 said a childish voice reproachfully.\a147Have I though,\a148 the man answered penitently, \a147I didn\a146t go for to do it.\a148 As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\a146s care. The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.\a147How is it now?\a148 he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\a147Kiss it and make it well,\a148 she said, with perfect gravity, shoving the injured part up to him. \a147That\a146s what mother used to do. Where\a146s mother?\a148\a147Mother\a146s gone. I guess you\a146ll see her before long.\a148\a147Gone, eh!\a148 said the little girl. \a147Funny, she didn\a146t say good-bye; she \a145most always did if she was just goin\a146 over to Auntie\a146s for tea, and now she\a146s been away three days. Say, it\a146s awful dry, ain\a146t it. Ain\a146t there no water, nor nothing to eat?\a148\a147No, there ain\a146t nothing, dearie. You\a146ll just need to be patient awhile, and then you\a146ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you\a146ll feel bullier. It ain\a146t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I\a146d best let you know how the cards lie. What\a146s that you\a146ve got?\a148\a147Pretty things! fine things!\a148 cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \a147When we goes back to home I\a146ll give them to brother Bob.\a148\a147You\a146ll see prettier things than them soon,\a148 said the man confidently. \a147You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though\a151 you remember when we left the river?\a148\a147Oh, yes.\a148\a147Well, we reckoned we\a146d strike another river soon, d\a146ye see. But there was somethin\a146 wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\a146, and it didn\a146t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and\a151 and\a151\a151\a148\a147And you couldn\a146t wash yourself,\a148 interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy visage.\a147No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.\a148\a147Then mother\a146s a deader too,\a148 cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\a147Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don\a146t seem as though we\a146ve improved matters. There\a146s an almighty small chance for us now!\a148\a147Do you mean that we are going to die too?\a148 asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\a147I guess that\a146s about the size of it.\a148\a147Why didn\a146t you say so before?\a148 she said, laughing gleefully. \a147You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\a146ll be with mother again.\a148\a147Yes, you will, dearie.\a148\a147And you too. I\a146ll tell her how awful good you\a146ve been. I\a146ll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?\a148\a147I don\a146t know\a151 not very long.\a148 The man\a146s eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\a147Cocks and hens,\a148 cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \a147Say, did God make this country?\a148\a147In course He did,\a148 said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.\a147He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\a148 the little girl continued. \a147I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It\a146s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.\a148\a147What would ye think of offering up prayer?\a148 the man asked diffidently.\a147It ain\a146t night yet,\a148 she answered.\a147It don\a146t matter. It ain\a146t quite regular, but He won\a146t mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains.\a148\a147Why don\a146t you say some yourself?\a148 the child asked, with wondering eyes.\a147I disremember them,\a148 he answered. \a147I ain\a146t said none since I was half the height o\a146 that gun. I guess it\a146s never too late. You say them out, and I\a146ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\a148\a147Then you\a146ll need to kneel down, and me too,\a148 she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. \a147You\a146ve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o\a146 good.\a148It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices\a151 the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh\a151 united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man\a146s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan. When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave iron-faced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.\a147The wells are to the right, my brothers,\a148 said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\a147To the right of the Sierra Blanco\a151 so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\a148 said another.\a147Fear not for water,\a148 cried a third. \a147He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\a148\a147Amen. Amen!\a148 responded the whole party.They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word \a145Redskins\a146 was on every lip.\a147There can\a146t be any number of Injuns here,\a148 said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. \a147We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\a148\a147Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\a148 asked one of the band.\a147And I,\a148 \a147and I,\a148 cried a dozen voices.\a147Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\a148 the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes.On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. \a147This is what they call delirium, I guess,\a148 he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\a147My name is John Ferrier,\a148 the wanderer explained; \a147me and that little un are all that\a146s left o\a146 twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o\a146 thirst and hunger away down in the south.\a148\a147Is she your child?\a148 asked someone.\a147I guess she is now,\a148 the other cried, defiantly; \a147she\a146s mine \a145cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She\a146s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?\a148 he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \a147there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.\a148\a147Nigh upon ten thousand,\a148 said one of the young men; \a147we are the persecuted children of God\a151 the chosen of the Angel Merona.\a148\a147I never heard tell on him,\a148 said the wanderer. \a147He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.\a148\a147Do not jest at that which is sacred,\a148 said the other sternly. \a147We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\a148The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \a147I see,\a148 he said, \a147you are the Mormons.\a148\a147We are the Mormons,\a148 answered his companions with one voice.\a147And where are you going?\a148\a147We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.\a148They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims\a151 pale-faced meek-looking women, strong laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways.\a147If we take you with us,\a148 he said, in solemn words, \a147it can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\a148\a147Guess I\a146ll come with you on any terms,\a148 said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression.\a147Take him, Brother Stangerson,\a148 he said, \a147give him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward. On, on to Zion!\a148\a147On, on to Zion!\a148 cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.\a147You shall remain here,\a148 he said. \a147In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\a148\p\BChapter II\B - \X2\BThe Flower Of Utah\B\X2This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease\a151 every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\a146s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\a146s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\a146s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man.Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more ruddy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\a146s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\a146s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\a147You\a146re not hurt, I hope, miss,\a148 said her preserver, respectfully.She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \a147I\a146m awful frightened,\a148 she said, naively; \a147whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?\a148\a147Thank God you kept your seat,\a148 the other said earnestly. He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. \a147I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\a148 he remarked, \a147I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he\a146s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\a148\a147Hadn\a146t you better come and ask yourself?\a148 she asked, demurely.The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure. \a147I\a146ll do so,\a148 he said, \a147we\a146ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.\a148\a147He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\a148 she answered, \a147he\a146s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he\a146d have never got over it.\a148\a147Neither would I,\a148 said her companion.\a147You. Well, I don\a146t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain\a146t even a friend of ours.\a148The young hunter\a146s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud.\a147There, I didn\a146t mean that,\a148 she said; \a147of course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won\a146t trust me with his business any more. Good-bye!\a148\a147Good-bye,\a148 he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful.He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections.It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\a147I am off, Lucy,\a148 he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; \a147I won\a146t ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?\a148\a147And when will that be?\a148 she asked, blushing and laughing.\a147A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There\a146s no one who can stand between us.\a148\a147And how about father?\a148 she asked.\a147He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I have no fear on that head.\a148\a147Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there\a146s no more to be said,\a148 she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.\a147Thank God!\a148 he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \a147It is settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the canon. Good-bye, my own darling\a151 good-bye. In two months you shall see me.\a148He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.\p\BChapter III\B - \X2\BJohn Ferrier Talks With The Prophet\B\X2Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier\a146s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\a146s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints.Yes, a dangerous matter\a151 so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah.Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organisation doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about\a151 rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders\a151 women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.Fuller knowledge of the organisation which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart.One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation\a151 for he knew that such a visit boded him little good\a151 Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\a147Brother Ferrier,\a148 he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \a147the true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\a148\a147It is so,\a148 answered John Ferrier.\a147In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.\a148\a147And how have I neglected it?\a148 asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. \a147Have I not given to the common fund. Have I not attended at the Temple. Have I not\a151\a151?\a148\a147Where are your wives?\a148 asked Young, looking round him. \a147Call them in, that I may greet them.\a148\a147It is true that I have not married,\a148 Ferrier answered. \a147But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man. I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\a148\a147It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\a148 said the leader of the Mormons. \a147She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\a148John Ferrier groaned internally.\a147There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve\a151 stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith. \a145Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\a146 This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.\a148John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.\a147Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested\a151 so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers, but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?\a148Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\a147You will give us time,\a148 he said at last. \a147My daughter is very young\a151 she is scarce of an age to marry.\a148\a147She shall have a month to choose,\a148 said Young, rising from his seat. \a147At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\a148He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes. \a147It were better for you, John Ferrier,\a148 he thundered, \a147that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!\a148With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\a147I could not help it,\a148 she said, in answer to his look. \a147His voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\a148\a147Don\a146t you scare yourself,\a148 he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \a147We\a146ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\a146t find your fancy kind o\a146 lessening for this chap, do you?\a148A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\a147No; of course not. I shouldn\a146t care to hear you say you did. He\a146s a likely lad, and he\a146s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o\a146 all their praying and preaching. There\a146s a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I\a146ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o\a146 that young man, he\a146ll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\a148Lucy laughed through her tears at her father\a146s description.\a147When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears\a151 one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.\a148\a147But we haven\a146t opposed him yet,\a148 her father answered. \a147It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\a148\a147Leave Utah!\a148\a147That\a146s about the size of it.\a148\a147But the farm?\a148\a147We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn\a146t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don\a146t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I\a146m a free-born American, and it\a146s all new to me. Guess I\a146m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.\a148\a147But they won\a146t let us leave,\a148 his daughter objected.\a147Wait till Jefferson comes, and we\a146ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don\a146t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\a146t get your eyes swelled up, else he\a146ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\a146s nothing to be afeared about, and there\a146s no danger at all.\a148John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\p\BChapter IV\B - \X2\BA Flight For Life\B\X2On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\a147Maybe you don\a146t know us,\a148 he said. \a147This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I\a146m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.\a148\a147As He will all the nations in His own good time,\a148 said the other in a nasal voice; \a147He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\a148John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\a147We have come,\a148 continued Stangerson, \a147at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\a148\a147Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\a148 cried the other; \a147the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\a148\a147But my prospects are better,\a148 said the other, warmly. \a147When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\a148\a147It will be for the maiden to decide,\a148 rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \a147We will leave it all to her decision.\a148During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\a147Look here,\a148 he said at last, striding up to them, \a147when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\a146t want to see your faces again.\a148The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\a146s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.\a147There are two ways out of the room,\a148 cried Ferrier; \a147there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\a148His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door.\a147Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\a148 he said, sardonically.\a147You shall smart for this!\a148 Stangerson cried, white with rage. \a147You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.\a148\a147The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\a148 cried young Drebber; \a147He will arise and smite you!\a148\a147Then I\a146ll start the smiting,\a148 exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\a146 hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\a147The young canting rascals!\a148 he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; \a147I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.\a148\a147And so should I, father,\a148 she answered, with spirit; \a147but Jefferson will soon be here.\a148\a147Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.\a148It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:\a151\a147Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then\a151\a151\a148The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers. The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door.Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\a146s dishonour.He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then. All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter\a151 what was to become of her after he was gone. Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.What was that. In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound\a151 low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal. Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open.Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\a146s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.\a147Good God!\a148 gasped John Ferrier. \a147How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.\a148\a147Give me food,\a148 the other said, hoarsely. \a147I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\a148 He flung himself upon the cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\a146s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \a147Does Lucy bear up well?\a148 he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.\a147Yes. She does not know the danger,\a148 her father answered.\a147That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\a146re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\a148John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man\a146s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. \a147You\a146re a man to be proud of,\a148 he said. \a147There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\a148\a147You\a146ve hit it there, pard,\a148 the young hunter answered. \a147I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\a146d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet\a146s nest. It\a146s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\a146 the Hope family in Utah.\a148\a147What are we to do?\a148\a147To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?\a148\a147Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\a148\a147That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.\a148While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.\a147We must make our start at once,\a148 said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \a147The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.\a148\a147What if we are stopped,\a148 asked Ferrier.Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic. \a147If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,\a148 he said with a sinister smile.The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\a147To-morrow at midnight,\a148 said the first who appeared to be in authority. \a147When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\a148\a147It is well,\a148 returned the other. \a147Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\a148\a147Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\a148\a147Seven to five!\a148 repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.\a147Hurry on! hurry on!\a148 he gasped from time to time. \a147We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\a148Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying.They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \a147Who goes there?\a148 rang through the silent ravine.\a147Travellers for Nevada,\a148 said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle.They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.\a147By whose permission?\a148 he asked.\a147The Holy Four,\a148 answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\a147Nine from seven,\a148 cried the sentinel.\a147Seven from five,\a148 returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden.\a147Pass, and the Lord go with you,\a148 said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.\p\BChapter V\B - \X2\BThe Avenging Angels\B\X2All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope\a146s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\a146s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \a147They will be upon our track by this time,\a148 he said. \a147Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives.\a148During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\a146 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organisation whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\a146 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn\a151 for so it is called\a151 was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognise the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence\a151 a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them. Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\c\iJOHN FERRIERFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITYDied August 4th, 1860.\i\cThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\a146s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Canon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse\a146s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognised him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier\a146s fate had been.\a147I am Jefferson Hope,\a148 he said. \a147You remember me.\a148The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment\a151 indeed, it was difficult to recognise in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man\a146s surprise changed to consternation.\a147You are mad to come here,\a148 he cried. \a147It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\a148\a147I don\a146t fear them, or their warrant,\a148 Hope said, earnestly. \a147You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God\a146s sake, don\a146t refuse to answer me.\a148\a147What is it?\a148 the Mormon asked uneasily. \a147Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes.\a148\a147What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\a148\a147She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you.\a148\a147Don\a146t mind me,\a148 said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \a147Married, you say?\a148\a147Married yesterday\a151 that\a146s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\a146d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\a146s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won\a146t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\a148\a147Yes, I am off,\a148 said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\a147Where are you going?\a148\a147Never mind,\a148 he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\a146s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \a147She shall not be buried in that,\a148 he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\a146s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\a146s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then. And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\a146s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\a146s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts.Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognised the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\a146s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter\a146s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\a146s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.\p\BChapter VI\B - \X2\BA Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.\B\X2Our prisoner\a146s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \a147I guess you\a146re going to take me to the police-station,\a148 he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \a147My cab\a146s at the door. If you\a146ll loose my legs I\a146ll walk down to it. I\a146m not so light to lift as I used to be.\a148Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.\a147If there\a146s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,\a148 he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \a147The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\a148\a147You had better come with me,\a148 said Holmes to the two detectives.\a147I can drive you,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\a148I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\a146s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \a147The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\a148 he said; \a147in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\a148\a147I\a146ve got a good deal to say,\a148 our prisoner said slowly. \a147I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.\a148\a147Hadn\a146t you better reserve that for your trial?\a148 asked the Inspector.\a147I may never be tried,\a148 he answered. \a147You needn\a146t look startled. It isn\a146t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\a148 He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\a147Yes; I am,\a148 I answered.\a147Then put your hand here,\a148 he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled wrists towards his chest.I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\a147Why,\a148 I cried, \a147you have an aortic aneurism!\a148\a147That\a146s what they call it,\a148 he said, placidly. \a147I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I\a146ve done my work now, and I don\a146t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don\a146t want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.\a148The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.\a147Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\a148 the former asked.\a147Most certainly there is,\a148 I answered.\a147In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement,\a148 said the Inspector. \a147You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\a148\a147I\a146ll sit down, with your leave,\a148 the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word. \a147This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I\a146m on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.\a148With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade\a146s note-book, in which the prisoner\a146s words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.\a147It don\a146t much matter to you why I hated these men,\a148 he said; \a147it\a146s enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings\a151 a father and a daughter\a151 and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You\a146d have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\a147That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\a147They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cab-owner\a146s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.\a147It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognising me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.\a147They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.\a147They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.\a147At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday\a146s Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.\a147The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.\a147He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\a148I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\a147That\a146s better,\a148 he said. \a147Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. \a145You hound,\a146 he cried, shaking his stick at him; \a145I\a146ll teach you to insult an honest girl!\a146 He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. \a145Drive me to Halliday\a146s Private Hotel,\a146 said he.\a147When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.\a147Don\a146t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\a147It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within\a151 so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\a147There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \a145It\a146s time to get out,\a146 I said.\a147\a160\a145All right, cabby,\a146 said he.\a147I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.\a147\a160\a145It\a146s infernally dark,\a146 said he, stamping about.\a147\a160\a145We\a146ll soon have a light,\a146 I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. \a145Now, Enoch Drebber,\a146 I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \a145who am I?\a146\a147He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\a147\a160\a145You dog!\a146 I said; \a145I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow\a146s sun rise.\a146 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.\a147\a160\a145What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?\a146 I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. \a145Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.\a146 I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\a147\a160\a145Would you murder me?\a146 he stammered.\a147\a160\a145There is no murder,\a146 I answered. \a145Who talks of murdering a mad dog. What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.\a146\a147\a160\a145It was not I who killed her father,\a146 he cried.\a147\a160\a145But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\a146 I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. \a145Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.\a146\a147He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system. I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy\a146s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!\a147The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don\a146t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\a146s ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\a146s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house\a151 for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\a147That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\a146s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday\a146s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber\a146s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.\a147I have little more to say, and it\a146s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled as ever I saw in my life. That\a146s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\a148So thrilling had the man\a146s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, \iblas\a200\i as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man\a146s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade\a146s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account.\a147There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,\a148 Sherlock Holmes said at last. \a147Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised?\a148The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \a147I can tell my own secrets,\a148 he said, \a147but I don\a146t get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you\a146ll own he did it smartly.\a148\a147Not a doubt of that,\a148 said Holmes heartily.\a147Now, gentlemen,\a148 the Inspector remarked gravely, \a147the forms of the law must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him.\a148 He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\p\BChapter VII\B - \X2\BThe Conclusion\B\X2We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.\a147Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\a148 Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. \a147Where will their grand advertisement be now?\a148\a147I don\a146t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\a148 I answered.\a147What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\a148 returned my companion, bitterly. \a147The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,\a148 he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \a147I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.\a148\a147Simple!\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \a147The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\a148\a147That is true,\a148 said I.\a147I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\a148\a147I confess,\a148 said I, \a147that I do not quite follow you.\a148\a147I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.\a148\a147I understand,\a148 said I.\a147Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\a146s brougham.\a147This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.\a147On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\a146s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\a146s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.\a147And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman. That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\a146s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.\a147I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\a146s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\a146s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\a147Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.\a147I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.\a147If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden chance would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one. I therefore organised my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.\a148\a147It is wonderful!\a148 I cried. \a147Your merits should be publicly recognised. You should publish an account of the case. If you won\a146t, I will for you.\a148\a147You may do what you like, Doctor,\a148 he answered. \a147See here!\a148 he continued, handing a paper over to me, \a147look at this!\a148It was the \iEcho\i for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.\a147The public,\a148 it said, \a147have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.\a148\a147Didn\a146t I tell you so when we started?\a148 cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. \a147That\a146s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!\a148\a147Never mind,\a148 I answered, \a147I have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser\a151\a147\a160\a145Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\a146\a160\a148\p\c\l\B\X0The Sign of the Four\X0\B\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\l\p\i\m="sign-17.png"\i\c\p\BChapter 1\B - \X1\BThe Science of Deduction\B\X1Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined armchair with a long sigh of satisfaction.Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.\a147Which is it today?\a148 I asked,\a151\a147morphine or cocaine?\a148He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened. \a147It is cocaine,\a148 he said,\a151\a147a seven-per-cent solution. Would you care to try it?\a148\a147No, indeed,\a148 I answered, brusquely. \a147My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.\a148He smiled at my vehemence. \a147Perhaps you are right, Watson,\a148 he said. \a147I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.\a148\a147But consider!\a148 I said, earnestly. \a147Count the cost. Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed. Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.\a148He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation.\a147My mind,\a148 he said, \a147rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,\a151 or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\a148\a147The only unofficial detective?\a148 I said, raising my eyebrows.\a147The only unofficial consulting detective,\a148 he answered. \a147I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths\a151 which, by the way, is their normal state\a151 the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist\a146s opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.\a148\a147Yes, indeed,\a148 said I, cordially. \a147I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of \a145A Study in Scarlet.\a146\a160\a148He shook his head sadly. \a147I glanced over it,\a148 said he. \a147Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\a148\a147But the romance was there,\a148 I remonstrated. \a147I could not tamper with the facts.\a148\a147Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unravelling it.\a148I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion\a146s quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.\a147My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\a148 said Holmes, after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. \a147I was consulted last week by Fran\a231ois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance\a148. He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray \imagnifiques\i, \icoup-de-maitres\i, and \itours-de-force\i, all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.\a147He speaks as a pupil to his master,\a148 said I.\a147Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. \a147He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into French.\a148\a147Your works?\a148\a147Oh, didn\a146t you know?\a148 he cried, laughing. \a147Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one \a145Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos\a148. In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird\a146s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\a148\a147You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,\a148 I remarked.\a147I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective,\a151 especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.\a148\a147Not at all,\a148 I answered, earnestly. \a147It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\a148\a147Why, hardly,\a148 he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. \a147For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.\a148\a147Right!\a148 said I. \a147Right on both points. But I confess that I don\a146t see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.\a148\a147It is simplicity itself,\a148 he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,\a151\a147so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.\a148\a147How, then, did you deduce the telegram?\a148\a147Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire. Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.\a148\a147In this case it certainly is so,\a148 I replied, after a little thought. \a147The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 he answered, \a147it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.\a148\a147I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?\a148I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.\a147There are hardly any data,\a148 he remarked. \a147The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\a148\a147You are right,\a148 I answered. \a147It was cleaned before being sent to me\a148. In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?\a147Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\a148 he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. \a147Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\a148\a147That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\a148\a147Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\a148\a147Right, so far,\a148 said I. \a147Anything else?\a148\a147He was a man of untidy habits,\a151 very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.\a148I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.\a147This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\a148 I said. \a147I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch. It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\a148\a147My dear doctor,\a148 said he, kindly, \a147pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\a148\a147Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts. They are absolutely correct in every particular.\a148\a147Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\a148\a147But it was not mere guess-work?\a148\a147No, no. I never guess. It is a shocking habit,\a151 destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.\a148I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\a147It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,\a151 that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference,\a151 that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole,\a151 marks where the key has slipped. What sober man\a146s key could have scored those grooves. But you will never see a drunkard\a146s watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?\a148\a147It is as clear as daylight,\a148 I answered. \a147I regret the injustice which I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?\a148\a147None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for. Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world. See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-coloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material. What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them. Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\a148I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\a147A young lady for you, sir,\a148 she said, addressing my companion.\a147Miss Mary Morstan,\a148 he read. \a147Hum. I have no recollection of the name. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don\a146t go, doctor. I should prefer that you remain.\a148\BChapter II\B - \X1\BThe Statement of the Case\B\X1Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner. She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.\a147I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 she said, \a147because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\a148\a147Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\a148 he repeated thoughtfully. \a147I believe that I was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.\a148\a147She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.\a148Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawk-like features. \a147State your case,\a148 said he, in brisk, business tones.I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. \a147You will, I am sure, excuse me,\a148 I said, rising from my chair.To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me. \a147If your friend,\a148 she said, \a147would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.\a148I relapsed into my chair.\a147Briefly,\a148 she continued, \a147the facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months\a146 leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead\a151. She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.\a147The date?\a148 asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\a147He disappeared upon the 3rd of December, 1878,\a151 nearly ten years ago.\a148\a147His luggage?\a148\a147Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,\a151 some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there.\a148\a147Had he any friends in town?\a148\a147Only one that we know of,\a151 Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England.\a148\a147A singular case,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago\a151 to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882\a151 an advertisement appeared in \iThe Times\i asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome\a148. She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\a147Your statement is most interesting,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147Has anything else occurred to you?\a148\a147Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The envelope too, please. Postmark, London, S.W. Date, July 7. Hum. Man\a146s thumb-mark on corner,\a151 probably postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in his stationery. No address. \a145Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o\a146clock. If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend\a148. Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\a148\a147That is exactly what I want to ask you.\a148\a147Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and\a151 yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before.\a148\a147But would he come?\a148 she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.\a147I should be proud and happy,\a148 said I, fervently, \a147if I can be of any service.\a148\a147You are both very kind,\a148 she answered. \a147I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?\a148\a147You must not be later,\a148 said Holmes. \a147There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?\a148\a147I have them here,\a148 she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper.\a147You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now\a148. He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other. \a147They are disguised hands, except the letter,\a148 he said, presently, \a147but there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\a148\a147Nothing could be more unlike.\a148\a147I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\a148\a147Au revoir,\a148 said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd.\a147What a very attractive woman!\a148 I exclaimed, turning to my companion.He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. \a147Is she?\a148 he said, languidly. \a147I did not observe.\a148\a147You really are an automaton,\a151 a calculating-machine!\a148 I cried. \a147There is something positively inhuman in you at times.\a148He smiled gently. \a147It is of the first importance,\a148 he said, \a147not to allow your judgement to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,\a151 a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\a148\a147In this case, however\a151\a148\a147I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting. What do you make of this fellow\a146s scribble?\a148\a147It is legible and regular,\a148 I answered. \a147A man of business habits and some force of character.\a148Holmes shook his head. \a147Look at his long letters,\a148 he said. \a147They hardly rise above the common herd. That \id\i might be an \ia\i, and that \il\i an \ie\i. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his \ik\i\a146s and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,\a151 one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade\a146s \iMartyrdom of Man\i. I shall be back in an hour.\a148I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor,\a151 her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father\a146s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,\a151 a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things. She was a unit, a factor,\a151 nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o\a146-the-wisps of the imagination.\p\BChapter III\B - \X1\BIn Quest of a Solution\B\X1It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,\a151 a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.\a147There is no great mystery in this matter,\a148 he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. \a147The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\a148\a147What! you have solved it already?\a148\a147Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, \ivery\i suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\a148\a147I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\a148\a147No. You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. \iWithin a week of his death\i Captain Morstan\a146s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father. And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto\a146s death, unless it is that Sholto\a146s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation. Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\a148\a147But what a strange compensation. And how strangely made. Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago. Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have. It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\a148\a147There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \a147But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready. Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\a148I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night\a146s work might be a serious one.Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\a147Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa\a146s,\a148 she said. \a147His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa\a146s desk which no one could understand. I don\a146t suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\a148Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.\a147It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\a148 he remarked. \a147It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is \a1453.37 from left,\a146 in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, \a145The sign of the four,\a151 Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar\a148. No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\a148\a147It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\a148\a147Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas\a148. He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.It was a September evening, and not yet seven o\a146clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vapourous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,\a151 sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan\a146s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\a147Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\a148 he asked.\a147I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\a148 said she.He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. \a147You will excuse me, miss,\a148 he said with a certain dogged manner, \a147but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\a148\a147I give you my word on that,\a148 she answered.He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,\a151 which was an inconceivable hypothesis,\a151 or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan\a146s demeanour was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavoured to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.\a147Rochester Row,\a148 said he. \a147Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\a148We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.\a147Wordsworth Road,\a148 said my companion. \a147Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbour Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\a148We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,\a151 the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.\a147The Sahib awaits you,\a148 said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. \a147Show them in to me, \ikhitmutgar\i,\a148 it cried. \a147Show them straight in to me.\a148\p\BChapter IV\B - \X1\BThe Story of the Bald-Headed Man\B\X1We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year.\a147Your servant, Miss Morstan,\a148 he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. \a147Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.\a148We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.\a147Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\a148 said the little man, still jerking and smiling. \a147That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen\a151\a148\a147This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\a148\a147A doctor, eh?\a148 cried he, much excited. \a147Have you your stethoscope. Might I ask you\a151 would you have the kindness. I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\a148I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. \a147It appears to be normal,\a148 I said. \a147You have no cause for uneasiness.\a148\a147You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\a148 he remarked, airily. \a147I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.\a148I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips. \a147I knew in my heart that he was dead,\a148 said she.\a147I can give you every information,\a148 said he, \a147and, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,\a151 no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity\a148. He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes.\a147For my part,\a148 said Holmes, \a147whatever you may choose to say will go no further.\a148I nodded to show my agreement.\a147That is well. That is well!\a148 said he. \a147May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan. Or of Tokay. I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask. No. Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative\a148. He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre.\a147When I first determined to make this communication to you,\a148 said he, \a147I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.\a148\a147You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\a148 said Miss Morstan, \a147but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.\a148\a147At the best it must take some time,\a148 he answered; \a147for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. I had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry.\a148\a147If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once,\a148 I ventured to remark.He laughed until his ears were quite red. \a147That would hardly do,\a148 he cried. \a147I don\a146t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself.\a147My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.\a147I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father\a146s, we discussed the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,\a151 that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.\a147We did know, however, that some mystery\a151 some positive danger\a151 overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father\a146s, but events have since led us to change our opinion.\a147Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us.\a147When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his own very words.\a147\a160\a145I have only one thing,\a146 he said, \a145which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan\a146s orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself,\a151 so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send her nothing\a151 not even the chaplet\a151 until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered.\a147\a160\a145I will tell you how Morstan died,\a146 he continued. \a145He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan\a146s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.\a147\a160\a145For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.\a147\a160\a145I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door behind him. \a147Do not fear, Sahib,\a148 he said. \a147No one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\a148 \a147I did not kill him,\a148 said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \a147I heard it all, Sahib,\a148 said he. \a147I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together\a148. That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box. Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan\a146s share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in\a151. At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, \a145Keep him out. For Christ\a146s sake keep him out!. We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.\a147We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father\a146s room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words \a145The sign of the four\a146 scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father\a146s property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.\a148The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father\a146s death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe.\a147My brother and I,\a148 said he, \a147were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father\a146s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan\a146s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\a148\a147It was a kindly thought,\a148 said our companion, earnestly. \a147It was extremely good of you.\a148The little man waved his hand deprecatingly.\a147We were your trustees,\a148 he said. \a147That was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. \iLe mauvais gout mene au crime\i. The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself; so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old \ikhitmutgar\i and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew, so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\a148Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring to his feet.\a147You have done well, sir, from first to last,\a148 said he. \a147It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.\a148Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face.\a147My health is somewhat fragile,\a148 he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. \a147I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\a148Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels.\a147Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\a148 said he. \a147How do you think he found out where the treasure was. He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.\a148At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.\a147This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\a148 said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.\p\BChapter V\B - \X1\BThe Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge\B\X1It was nearly eleven o\a146clock when we reached this final stage of our night\a146s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\a147Who is there?\a148 cried a gruff voice from within.\a147It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.\a148There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\a147That you, Mr. Thaddeus. But who are the others. I had no orders about them from the master.\a148\a147No, McMurdo. You surprise me. I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.\a148\a147He ain\a146t been out o\a146 his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\a148This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner. \a147This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\a148 he said. \a147If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\a148\a147Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\a148 said the porter, inexorably. \a147Folk may be friends o\a146 yours, and yet no friends o\a146 the master\a146s. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I\a146ll do. I don\a146t know none o\a146 your friends.\a148\a147Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\a148 cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. \a147I don\a146t think you can have forgotten me. Don\a146t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison\a146s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?\a148\a147Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\a148 roared the prize-fighter. \a147God\a146s truth! how could I have mistook you. If instead o\a146 standin\a146 there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I\a146d ha\a146 known you without a question. Ah, you\a146re one that has wasted your gifts, you have. You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.\a148\a147You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147Our friend won\a146t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\a148\a147In you come, sir, in you come,\a151 you and your friends,\a148 he answered. \a147Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.\a148Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\a147I cannot understand it,\a148 he said. \a147There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.\a148\a147Does he always guard the premises in this way?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Yes; he has followed my father\a146s custom. He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew\a146s window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.\a148\a147None,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.\a148\a147Ah, that is the housekeeper\a146s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\a148He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,\a151 the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.\a147It is Mrs. Bernstone,\a148 said Sholto. \a147She is the only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment\a148. He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.\a147Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come. I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!. We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.\a147What a strange place!\a148 she said, looking round.\a147It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work.\a148\a147And from the same cause,\a148 said Holmes. \a147These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\a148At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.\a147There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\a148 he cried. \a147I am frightened. My nerves cannot stand it\a148. He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child.\a147Come into the house,\a148 said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.\a147Yes, do!\a148 pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. \a147I really do not feel equal to giving directions.\a148We all followed him into the housekeeper\a146s room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.\a147God bless your sweet calm face!\a148 she cried, with an hysterical sob. \a147It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!\a148Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the others bloodless cheeks.\a147Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,\a148 she explained. \a147All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,\a151 you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that.\a148Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto\a146s teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.\a147There is something devilish in this, Watson,\a148 said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. \a147What do you make of it?\a148I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,\a151 the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.\a147This is terrible!\a148 I said to Holmes. \a147What is to be done?\a148\a147The door must come down,\a148 he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto\a146s chamber.It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odour. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument,\a151 a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.\a147You see,\a148 he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \a147The sign of the four.\a148\a147In God\a146s name, what does it all mean?\a148 I asked.\a147It means murder,\a148 said he, stooping over the dead man. \a147Ah, I expected it. Look here!. He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.\a147It looks like a thorn,\a148 said I.\a147It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is poisoned.\a148I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been.\a147This is all an insoluble mystery to me,\a148 said I. \a147It grows darker instead of clearer.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 he answered, \a147it clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\a148We had almost forgotten our companion\a146s presence since we entered the chamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.\a147The treasure is gone!\a148 he said. \a147They have robbed him of the treasure. There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it. I was the last person who saw him. I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.\a148\a147What time was that?\a148\a147It was ten o\a146clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don\a146t think so, gentlemen. Surely you don\a146t think that it was I. Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I. Oh, dear! oh, dear. I know that I shall go mad!. He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\a147You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\a148 said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder. \a147Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return.\a148The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark.\p\BChapter VI - \X1Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration\B\X1\a147Now, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \a147we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.\a148\a147Simple!\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Surely,\a148 said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. \a147Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work. In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go. The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?\a148 He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. \a147Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson. This is really a very pretty demonstration.\a148I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. \a147This is not a footmark,\a148 said I.\a147It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\a148\a147It is the wooden-legged man.\a148\a147Quite so. But there has been some one else,\a151 a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?\a148I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the round, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work.\a147It is absolutely impossible,\a148 I answered.\a147Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,\a148 he continued, fingering the rope, \a147that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.\a148\a147This is all very well,\a148 said I, \a147but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally. How came he into the room?\a148\a147Yes, the ally!\a148 repeated Holmes, pensively. \a147There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,\a151 though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\a148\a147How came he, then?\a148 I reiterated. \a147The door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?\a148\a147The grate is much too small,\a148 he answered. \a147I had already considered that possibility.\a148\a147How then?\a148 I persisted.\a147You will not apply my precept,\a148 he said, shaking his head. \a147How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, \ihowever improbable\i, must be the truth. We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\a148\a147He came through the hole in the roof,\a148 I cried.\a147Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,\a151 the secret room in which the treasure was found.\a148He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.\a147Here you are, you see,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. \a147This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality.\a148He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,\a151 clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man.\a147Holmes,\a148 I said, in a whisper, \a147a child has done the horrid thing.\a148He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. \a147I was staggered for the moment,\a148 he said, \a147but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down.\a148\a147What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\a148 I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more.\a147My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\a148 said he, with a touch of impatience. \a147You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.\a148\a147I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\a148 I answered.\a147It will be clear enough to you soon,\a148 he said, in an off-hand way. \a147I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look\a148. He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.\a147We are certainly in luck,\a148 said he. \a147We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has leaked out.\a148\a147What then?\a148 I asked.\a147Why, we have got him, that\a146s all,\a148 said he. \a147I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world\a146s end. If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this. It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The answer should give us the\a151 But halloo! here are the accredited representatives of the law.\a148Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash.\a147Before they come,\a148 said Holmes, \a147just put your hand here on this poor fellow\a146s arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?\a148\a147The muscles are as hard as a board,\a148 I answered.\a147Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual \irigor mortis\i. Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or \irisus sardonicus\i, as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\a148\a147Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\a148 I answered,\a151\a147some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\a148\a147That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine the thorn.\a148I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.\a147Is that an English thorn?\a148 he asked.\a147No, it certainly is not.\a148\a147With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\a148As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.\a147Here\a146s a business!\a148 he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \a147Here\a146s a pretty business. But who are all these. Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!\a148\a147I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\a148 said Holmes, quietly.\a147Why, of course I do!\a148 he wheezed. \a147It\a146s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you. I\a146ll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It\a146s true you set us on the right track; but you\a146ll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.\a148\a147It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\a148\a147Oh, come, now, come. Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this. Bad business. Bad business. Stern facts here,\a151 no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case. I was at the station when the message arrived. What d\a146you think the man died of?\a148\a147Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over,\a148 said Holmes, dryly.\a147No, no. Still, we can\a146t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me. Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?\a148\a147Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.\a148\a147Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That\a146s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha. I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times.\a151 Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain.\a151 What do you think of this, Holmes. Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How\a146s that?\a148\a147On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.\a148\a147Hum. There\a146s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto \iwas\i with his brother; there \iwas\i a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is\a151 well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.\a148\a147You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man\a146s scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?\a148\a147Confirms it in every respect,\a148 said the fat detective, pompously. \a147House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,\a151 a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he depart. Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof\a148. With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.\a147He can find something,\a148 remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \a147He has occasional glimmerings of reason. \iIl n\a146y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l\a146esprit!\i\a148\a147You see!\a148 said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. \a147Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.\a148\a147It was I who opened it.\a148\a147Oh, indeed. You did notice it, then?\a148 He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. \a147Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!\a148\a147Yes, sir,\a148 from the passage.\a147Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.\a151 Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the queen\a146s name as being concerned in the death of your brother.\a148\a147There, now. Didn\a146t I tell you!\a148 cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.\a147Don\a146t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.\a148\a147Don\a146t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,\a151 don\a146t promise too much!\a148 snapped the detective. \a147You may find it a harder matter than you think.\a148\a147Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man\a151\a148\a147Ah! the other man\a151?\a148 asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other\a146s manner.\a147Is a rather curious person,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. \a147I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.\a151 A word with you, Watson.\a148He led me out to the head of the stair. \a147This unexpected occurrence,\a148 he said, \a147has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.\a148\a147I have just been thinking so,\a148 I answered. \a147It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.\a148\a147No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell, so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?\a148\a147By no means. I don\a146t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\a148\a147Your presence will be of great service to me,\a148 he answered. \a147We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare\a146s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water\a146s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer\a146s. Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.\a148\a147A dog, I suppose.\a148\a147Yes,\a151 a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would rather have Toby\a146s help than that of the whole detective force of London.\a148\a147I shall bring him, then,\a148 said I. \a147It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.\a148\a147And I,\a148 said Holmes, \a147shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones\a146s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. \iWir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen\i. Goethe is always pithy.\a148\p\BChapter VII\B - \X1\BThe Episode of the Barrel\B\X1The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,\a151 so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes\a146s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it fair, was it honourable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about. Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker. I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.It was nearly two o\a146clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester\a146s. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other\a146s waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honoured friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,\a151 we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan\a146s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto\a146s death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan\a146s chart,\a151 here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.\a147Go on, you drunken vagabone,\a148 said the face. \a147If you kick up any more row I\a146ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\a148\a147If you\a146ll let one out it\a146s just what I have come for,\a148 said I.\a147Go on!\a148 yelled the voice. \a147So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the bag, an\a146 I\a146ll drop it on your \a145ead if you don\a146t hook it.\a148\a147But I want a dog,\a148 I cried.\a147I won\a146t be argued with!\a148 shouted Mr. Sherman. \a147Now stand clear, for when I say \a145three,\a146 down goes the wiper.\a148\a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a151\a148 I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.\a147A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\a148 said he. \a147Step in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?\a148 This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. \a147Don\a146t mind that, sir; it\a146s only a slow-worm. It hain\a146t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o\a146 the room, for it keeps the beetles down. You must not mind my bein\a146 just a little short wi\a146 you at first, for I\a146m guyed at by the children, and there\a146s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\a148\a147He wanted a dog of yours.\a148\a147Ah! that would be Toby.\a148\a147Yes, Toby was the name.\a148\a147Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here\a148. He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in colour, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective\a146s name.Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe.\a147Ah, you have him there!\a148 said he. \a147Good dog, then. Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\a148We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.\a147Lend me your bull\a146s-eye, sergeant,\a148 said my companion. \a147Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.\a151 Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creosote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.\a148We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust.\a147I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\a148 he said. \a147Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?\a148\a147They belong,\a148 I said, \a147to a child or a small woman.\a148\a147Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?\a148\a147They appear to be much as other footmarks.\a148\a147Not at all. Look here. This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?\a148\a147Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.\a148\a147Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work. I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\a148I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell.\a147That is where he put his foot in getting out. If \iyou\i can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run down-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\a148By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves.\a147That you, Watson?\a148 he cried.\a147Yes.\a148\a147This is the place. What is that black thing down there?\a148\a147A water-barrel.\a148\a147Top on it?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147No sign of a ladder?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Confound the fellow. It\a146s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow.\a148There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth.\a147It was easy to follow him,\a148 he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. \a147Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\a148The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.\a147They are hellish things,\a148 said he. \a147Look out that you don\a146t prick yourself. I\a146m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\a148\a147Certainly,\a148 I answered.\a147Your leg will stand it?\a148\a147Oh, yes.\a148\a147Here you are, doggy. Good old Toby. Smell it, Toby, smell it!. He pushed the creosote handkerchief under the dog\a146s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the \ibouquet\i of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel\a146s collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonised with the black tragedy which hung over it.On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.\a147There\a146s the print of wooden-leg\a146s hand,\a148 he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. \a147You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday. The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours\a146 start.\a148I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creosote rose high above all other contending scents.\a147Do not imagine,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.\a148\a147There is credit, and to spare,\a148 said I. \a147I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\a148\a147Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\a146t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan\a146s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,\a151 the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers\a151 or one of them\a151 gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself. The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\a148\a147But that is mere speculation,\a148 said I.\a147It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?\a148\a147A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\a148\a147Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then. He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,\a151 a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\a146s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?\a148\a147No: it is clear and concise.\a148\a147Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man\a146s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?\a148\a147Very clearly.\a148\a147Now, what could Jonathan Small do. He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creosote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.\a148\a147But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\a148\a147Quite so. And rather to Jonathan\a146s disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don\a146t know that there is anything else.\a148\a147The associate?\a148\a147Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is. See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature. Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\a148\a147Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\a148\a147That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man\a146s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?\a148\a147I have my stick.\a148\a147It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead\a148. He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where labourers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight\a146s Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.\a147What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\a148 growled Holmes. \a147They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\a148\a147Perhaps they stood here for some time,\a148 I suggested.\a147Ah! it\a146s all right. He\a146s off again,\a148 said my companion, in a tone of relief.He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam in Holmes\a146s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson\a146s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creosote.Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.\p\BChapter VIII\B - \X1\BThe Baker Street Irregulars\B\X1\a147What now?\a148 I asked. \a147Toby has lost his character for infallibility.\a148\a147He acted according to his lights,\a148 said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. \a147If you consider how much creosote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\a148\a147We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\a148\a147Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight\a146s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.\a148There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction.\a147We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creosote-barrel came from,\a148 I observed.\a147I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent now.\a148It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince\a146s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water\a146s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.\a147We are out of luck,\a148 said Holmes. \a147They have taken to a boat here\a148. Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. \a147Mordecai Smith\a148 was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \a147Boats to hire by the hour or day\a148. A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,\a151 a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.\a147This looks bad,\a148 said he. \a147These fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.\a148He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.\a147You come back and be washed, Jack,\a148 she shouted. \a147Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he\a146ll let us hear of it.\a148\a147Dear little chap!\a148 said Holmes, strategically. \a147What a rosy-cheeked young rascal. Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\a148The youth pondered for a moment. \a147I\a146d like a shillin\a146,\a148 said he.\a147Nothing you would like better?\a148\a147I\a146d like two shillin\a146 better,\a148 the prodigy answered, after some thought.\a147Here you are, then. Catch!\a151 A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\a148\a147Lor\a146 bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a\a146most too much for me to manage, \a145specially when my man is away days at a time.\a148\a147Away, is he?\a148 said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. \a147I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\a148\a147He\a146s been away since yesterday mornin\a146, sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginnin\a146 to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.\a148\a147I wanted to hire his steam launch.\a148\a147Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That\a146s what puzzles me; for I know there ain\a146t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he\a146d been away in the barge I\a146d ha\a146 thought nothin\a146; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin\a146 there he might ha\a146 stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\a148\a147He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\a148\a147He might, sir, but it weren\a146t his way. Many a time I\a146ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don\a146t like that wooden-legged man, wi\a146 his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin\a146 about here for?\a148\a147A wooden-legged man?\a148 said Holmes, with bland surprise.\a147Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that\a146s called more\a146n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what\a146s more, my man knew he was comin\a146, for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don\a146t feel easy in my mind about it.\a148\a147But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\a148 said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \a147You are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night. I don\a146t quite understand how you can be so sure.\a148\a147His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o\a146 thick and foggy. He tapped at the winder,\a151 about three it would be. \a145Show a leg, matey,\a146 says he. \a145time to turn out guard\a148. My old man woke up Jim,\a151 that\a146s my eldest,\a151 and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could hear the wooden leg clackin\a146 on the stones.\a148\a147And was this wooden-legged man alone?\a148\a147Couldn\a146t say, I am sure, sir. I didn\a146t hear no one else.\a148\a147I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard good reports of the\a151 Let me see, what is her name?\a148\a147The \iAurora\i, sir.\a148\a147Ah. She\a146s not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?\a148\a147No, indeed. She\a146s as trim a little thing as any on the river. She\a146s been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\a148\a147Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?\a148\a147No, sir. Black with a white band.\a148\a147Ah, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.\a151 There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it and cross the river.\a147The main thing with people of that sort,\a148 said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, \a147is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\a148\a147Our course now seems pretty clear,\a148 said I.\a147What would you do, then?\a148\a147I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the \iAurora\i.\a148\a147My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.\a148\a147Employ the police, then.\a148\a147No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.\a148\a147Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\a148\a147Worse and worse. Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones\a146s energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent.\a148\a147What are we to do, then?\a148 I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary.\a147Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour\a146s sleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby. We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.\a148We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire. \a147Whom do you think that is to?\a148 he asked, as we resumed our journey.\a147I am sure I don\a146t know.\a148\a147You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\a148\a147Well,\a148 said I, laughing.\a147This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\a148It was between eight and nine o\a146clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee.\a147Here it is,\a148 said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. \a147The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first.\a148I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed \a147Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\a148\a147About twelve o\a146clock last night,\a148 said the \iStandard\i, \a147Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\a146s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\a146s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigourous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\a148\a147Isn\a146t it gorgeous!\a148 said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \a147What do you think of it?\a148\a147I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.\a148\a147So do I. I wouldn\a146t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.\a148At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay.\a147By heaven, Holmes,\a148 I said, half rising, \a147I believe that they are really after us.\a148\a147No, it\a146s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,\a151 the Baker Street irregulars.\a148As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow.\a147Got your message, sir,\a148 said he, \a147and brought \a145em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.\a148\a147Here you are,\a148 said Holmes, producing some silver. \a147In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the \iAurora\i, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith\a146s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?\a148\a147Yes, guv\a146nor,\a148 said Wiggins.\a147The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here\a146s a day in advance. Now off you go!. He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street.\a147If the launch is above water they will find her,\a148 said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. \a147They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the mean while, we can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the \iAurora\i or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\a148\a147Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?\a148\a147No. I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\a148\a147That other man again!\a148\a147I have no wish to make a mystery of him,\a151 to you, anyway. But you must have formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?\a148\a147A savage!\a148 I exclaimed. \a147Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.\a148\a147Hardly that,\a148 said he. \a147When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?\a148\a147South American,\a148 I hazarded.He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. \a147This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here. \a145Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal\a148. Hum! hum. What\a146s all this. Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods\a151 Ah, here we are. \a145The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained\a148. Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. \a145They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast\a148. Nice, amiable people, Watson. If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.\a148\a147But how came he to have so singular a companion?\a148\a147Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\a148He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,\a151 his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow. Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.\p\BChapter IX\B - \X1\BA Break in the Chain\B\X1It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.\a147You have slept soundly,\a148 he said. \a147I feared that our talk would wake you.\a148\a147I heard nothing,\a148 I answered. \a147Have you had fresh news, then?\a148\a147Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\a148\a147Can I do anything. I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night\a146s outing.\a148\a147No, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.\a148\a147Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\a148\a147On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\a148 asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes.\a147Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.\a148\a147I would not tell them too much,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Women are never to be entirely trusted,\a151 not the best of them.\a148I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. \a147I shall be back in an hour or two,\a148 I remarked.\a147All right. Good luck. But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don\a146t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.\a148I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist\a146s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night\a146s adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto\a146s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.\a147It is a romance!\a148 cried Mrs. Forrester. \a147An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\a148\a147And two knight-errants to the rescue,\a148 added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me.\a147Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don\a146t think that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\a148It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest.\a147It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\a148 she said. \a147Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.\a148It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home. My companion\a146s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none.\a147I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\a148 I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.\a147No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\a148 sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, \a147I am afraid for his health?\a148\a147Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\a148\a147Well, he\a146s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with \a145What is that, Mrs. Hudson?\a148 And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he\a146s not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don\a146t know how ever I got out of the room.\a148\a147I don\a146t think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\a148 I answered. \a147I have seen him like this before. He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless\a148. I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction.At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish colour upon either cheek.\a147You are knocking yourself up, old man,\a148 I remarked. \a147I heard you marching about in the night.\a148\a147No, I could not sleep,\a148 he answered. \a147This infernal problem is consuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.\a148\a147Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\a148\a147No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.\a148\a147Could it have gone up the river?\a148\a147I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\a148We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.\a147I am off down the river, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.\a148\a147Surely I can come with you, then?\a148 said I.\a147No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgement if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?\a148\a147Most certainly.\a148\a147I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.\a148I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the \iStandard\i, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.\a147With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\a148 it remarked, \a147we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.\a148\a147That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\a148 thought I. \a147Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\a148I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:\a147LOST.\a151 Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\a146s Wharf at or about three o\a146clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch \iAurora\i, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith\a146s Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch \iAurora\i.\a148This was clearly Holmes\a146s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion\a146s reasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception. Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises. I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic,\a151 his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes\a146s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally \ioutr\a233\i and startling.At three o\a146clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.\a147Good-day, sir; good-day,\a148 said he. \a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\a148\a147Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\a148\a147Thank you; I don\a146t mind if I do,\a148 said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief.\a147And a whiskey-and-soda?\a148\a147Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?\a148\a147I remember that you expressed one.\a148\a147Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother\a146s room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It\a146s a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\a148\a147We all need help sometimes,\a148 said I.\a147Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\a148 said he, in a husky and confidential voice. \a147He\a146s a man who is not to be beat. I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don\a146t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.\a148He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from Poplar at twelve o\a146clock. \a147Go to Baker Street at once,\a148 it said. \a147If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.\a148\a147This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\a148 said I.\a147Ah, then he has been at fault too,\a148 exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. \a147Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he.\a148A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a coloured scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.\a147What is it, my man?\a148 I asked.He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.\a147Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\a148 said he.\a147No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for him.\a148\a147It was to him himself I was to tell it,\a148 said he.\a147But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith\a146s boat?\a148\a147Yes. I knows well where it is. An\a146 I knows where the men he is after are. An\a146 I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.\a148\a147Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\a148\a147It was to him I was to tell it,\a148 he repeated, with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man.\a147Well, you must wait for him.\a148\a147No, no; I ain\a146t goin\a146 to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr. Holmes ain\a146t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don\a146t care about the look of either of you, and I won\a146t tell a word.\a148He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.\a147Wait a bit, my friend,\a148 said he. \a147You have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.\a148The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognised the uselessness of resistance.\a147Pretty sort o\a146 treatment this!\a148 he cried, stamping his stick. \a147I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!\a148\a147You will be none the worse,\a148 I said. \a147We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.\a148He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. Suddenly, however, Holmes\a146s voice broke in upon us.\a147I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\a148 he said.We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement.\a147Holmes!\a148 I exclaimed. \a147You here. But where is the old man?\a148\a147Here is the old man,\a148 said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \a147Here he is,\a151 wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\a148\a147Ah, You rogue!\a148 cried Jones, highly delighted. \a147You would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. You didn\a146t get away from us so easily, You see.\a148\a147I have been working in that get-up all day,\a148 said he, lighting his cigar. \a147You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me,\a151 especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases; so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this. You got my wire?\a148\a147Yes; that was what brought me here.\a148\a147How has your case prospered?\a148\a147It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\a148\a147Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But you must put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?\a148\a147Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\a148\a147Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat\a151 a steam launch\a151 to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o\a146clock.\a148\a147That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure.\a148\a147Then I shall want two staunch men, in case of resistance.\a148\a147There will be two or three in the boat. What else?\a148\a147When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first to open it.\a151 Eh, Watson?\a148\a147It would be a great pleasure to me.\a148\a147Rather an irregular proceeding,\a148 said Jones, shaking his head. \a147However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.\a148\a147Certainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?\a148\a147Well, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don\a146t see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\a148\a147That is understood, then?\a148\a147Perfectly. Is there anything else?\a148\a147Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines.\a151 Watson, you have never yet recognised my merits as a housekeeper.\a148\p\BChapter X\B - \X1\BThe End of the Islander\B\X1Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects,\a151 on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,\a151 handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a \ibon vivant\i. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes\a146s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port. \a147One bumper,\a148 said he, \a147to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?\a148\a147I have my old service-revolver in my desk.\a148\a147You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\a148It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.\a147Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\a148\a147Yes,\a151 that green lamp at the side.\a148\a147Then take it off.\a148The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.\a147Where to?\a148 asked Jones.\a147To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson\a146s Yard.\a148Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.\a147We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\a148 he said.\a147Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\a148\a147We shall have to catch the \iAurora\i, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,\a151 though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time\a151 as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge\a151 he could hardly leave at a moment\a146s notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\a148\a147It seems to me to be a little weak,\a148 said I. \a147It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.\a148\a147No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o\a146clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.\a148\a147But the launch. They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\a148\a147Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted. I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours\a146 notice.\a148\a147That seems simple enough.\a148\a147It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman\a146s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth\a151 Jacobson\a146s\a151 I learned that the \iAurora\i had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. \a145There ain\a146t naught amiss with her rudder,\a146 said the foreman. \a145There she lies, with the red streaks\a148. At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner. He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. \a145I want her to-night at eight o\a146clock,\a146 said he,\a151\a145eight o\a146clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won\a146t be kept waiting\a148. They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an alehouse; so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water\a146s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\a148\a147You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,\a148 said Jones; \a147but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson\a146s Yard, and arrested them when they came down.\a148\a147Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week.\a148\a147But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,\a148 said I.\a147In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions. They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\a148While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul\a146s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.\a147That is Jacobson\a146s Yard,\a148 said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. \a147Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters\a148. He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \a147I see my sentry at his post,\a148 he remarked, \a147but no sign of a handkerchief.\a148\a147Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\a148 said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.\a147We have no right to take anything for granted,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.\a148\a147They are coming from work in the yard.\a148\a147Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at them. There is no a \ipriori\i probability about it. A strange enigma is man!\a148\a147Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\a148 I suggested.\a147Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief. Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\a148\a147Yes, it is your boy,\a148 I cried. \a147I can see him plainly.\a148\a147And there is the \iAurora\i,\a148 exclaimed Holmes, \a147and going like the devil. Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!\a148She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head.\a147She is very fast,\a148 he said. \a147I doubt if we shall catch her.\a148\a147We \imust\i catch her!\a148 cried Holmes, between his teeth. \a147Heap it on, stokers. Make her do all she can. If we burn the boat we must have them!\a148We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the \iAurora\i lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the \iAurora\i thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.\a147Pile it on, men, pile it on!\a148 cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. \a147Get every pound of steam you can.\a148\a147I think we gain a little,\a148 said Jones, with his eyes on the \iAurora\i.\a147I am sure of it,\a148 said I. \a147We shall be up with her in a very few minutes.\a148At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat\a146s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man\a151 the smallest I have ever seen\a151 with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.\a147Fire if he raises his hand,\a148 said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat\a146s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The \iAurora\i herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.\a147See here,\a148 said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. \a147We were hardly quick enough with our pistols\a148. There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.\p\BChapter XI\B - \X1\BThe Great Agra Treasure\B\X1Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.\a147Well, Jonathan Small,\a148 said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \a147I am sorry that it has come to this.\a148\a147And so am I, sir,\a148 he answered, frankly. \a147I don\a146t believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.\a148\a147Have a cigar,\a148 said Holmes; \a147and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?\a148\a147You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it\a146s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.\a148\a147You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.\a148\a147That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I\a146d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don\a146t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,\a148 he added, with a bitter smile, \a147that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\a148At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. \a147Quite a family party,\a148 he remarked. \a147I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn\a146t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.\a148\a147All is well that ends well,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But I certainly did not know that the \iAurora\i was such a clipper.\a148\a147Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\a148\a147Neither he did,\a148 cried our prisoner,\a151\a147not a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\a148\a147Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them\a148. It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes\a146s face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.\a147We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\a148 said Jones, \a147and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\a148\a147Yes, I shall drive.\a148\a147It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\a148\a147At the bottom of the river,\a148 said Small, shortly.\a147Hum. There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\a148They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour\a146s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester\a146s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room; so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.She was seated by the open window, dressed n some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.\a147I heard a cab drive up,\a148 she said. \a147I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?\a148\a147I have brought something better than news,\a148 said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me. \a147I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.\a148She glanced at iron box. \a147Is that the treasure, then?\a148 she asked, coolly enough.\a147Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto\a146s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that. An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\a148I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.\a147If I have it,\a148 said she, \a147I owe it to you.\a148\a147No, no,\a148 I answered, \a147not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.\a148\a147Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\a148 said she.I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last,\a151 Holmes\a146s new method of search, the discovery of the \iAurora\i, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint.\a147It is nothing,\a148 she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. \a147I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.\a148\a147That is all over,\a148 I answered. \a147It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that. I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\a148\a147It would be of the greatest interest to me,\a148 she said. There was no eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win.\a147What a pretty box!\a148 she said, stooping over it. This is Indian work, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes; it is Benares metal-work.\a148\a147And so heavy!\a148 she exclaimed, trying to raise it. \a147The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?\a148\a147Small threw it into the Thames,\a148 I answered. \a147I must borrow Mrs. Forrester\a146s poker\a148. There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewellery lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty.\a147The treasure is lost,\a148 said Miss Morstan, calmly.As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. \a147Thank God!\a148 I ejaculated from my very heart.She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. \a147Why do you say that?\a148 she asked.\a147Because you are within my reach again,\a148 I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. \a147Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, \a145Thank God.\a146\a160\a148\a147Then I say, \a145Thank God,\a146 too,\a148 she whispered, as I drew her to my side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one.\p\BChapter XII\B - \X1\BThe Strange Story of Jonathan Small\B\X1A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box.\a147There goes the reward!\a148 said he, gloomily. \a147Where there is no money there is no pay. This night\a146s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\a148\a147Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\a148 I said. \a147He will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.\a148The inspector shook his head despondently, however. \a147It\a146s a bad job,\a148 he repeated; \a147and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\a148His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.\a147This is your doing, Small,\a148 said Athelney Jones, angrily.\a147Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\a148 he cried, exultantly. \a147It is my treasure; and if I can\a146t have the loot I\a146ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It\a146s been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You\a146ll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\a148\a147You are deceiving us, Small,\a148 said Athelney Jones, sternly. \a147If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.\a148\a147Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\a148 he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. \a147The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when you came up with us. However, there\a146s no good grieving over it. I\a146ve had ups in my life, and I\a146ve had downs, but I\a146ve learned not to cry over spilled milk.\a148\a147This is a very serious matter, Small,\a148 said the detective. \a147If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.\a148\a147Justice!\a148 snarled the ex-convict. \a147A pretty justice. Whose loot is this, if it is not ours. Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it. Look how I have earned it. Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it. I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga\a146s darts in my hide, than live in a convict\a146s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine\a148. Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.\a147You forget that we know nothing of all this,\a148 said Holmes quietly. \a147We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.\a148\a147Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God\a146s truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass beside me here, and I\a146ll put my lips to it if I am dry.\a147I am a Worcestershire man myself,\a151 born near Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen\a146s shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs, which was just starting for India.\a147I wasn\a146t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.\a147I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel\a146s, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep a good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.\a147Well, I was never in luck\a146s way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,\a151 a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson\a146s wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite\a146s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.\a147As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,\a151 which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.\a147The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don\a146t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,\a151 the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring.\a147The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organise a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack.\a147Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.\a147The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\a147My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, \a145Don\a146t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river\a148. There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow\a146s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\a147\a160\a145Listen to me, Sahib,\a146 said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. \a145You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life. We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.\a146\a147\a160\a145How can I decide?\a146 said I. \a145You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and welcome.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is nothing against the fort,\a146 said he. \a145We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.\a146\a147\a160\a145But what is the treasure, then?\a146 I asked. \a145I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.\a146\a147\a160\a145You will swear, then,\a146 said he, \a145by the bones of your father, by the honour of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?\a146\a147\a160\a145I will swear it,\a146 I answered, \a145provided that the fort is not endangered.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.\a146\a147\a160\a145There are but three,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say.\a147\a160\a145There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,\a151 with the Sepoy and with the Company\a146s Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men\a146s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt.\a147\a160\a145This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?\a146\a147In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne\a146er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.\a147\a160\a145Consider, Sahib,\a146 said he, \a145that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well. The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company\a146s coffers. There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. What could be better for the purpose. Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.\a146\a147\a160\a145I am with you heart and soul,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145It is well,\a146 he answered, handing me back my firelock. \a145You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.\a146\a147\a160\a145Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.\a146\a147The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.\a147Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction.\a147\a160\a145Here they are!\a146 I exclaimed.\a147\a160\a145You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,\a146 whispered Abdullah. \a145Give him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.\a146\a147The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.\a147\a160\a145Who goes there?\a146 said I, in a subdued voice.\a147\a160\a145Friends,\a146 came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me.\a147\a160\a145Your protection, Sahib,\a146 he panted,\a151\a145your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,\a151 I and my poor possessions.\a146\a147\a160\a145What have you in the bundle?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145An iron box,\a146 he answered, \a145which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.\a146\a147I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.\a147\a160\a145Take him to the main guard,\a146 said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gate-way. Never was a man so compassed round with death. I remained at the gate-way with the lantern.\a147I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not.\a148He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.\a147It was all very bad, no doubt,\a148 said he. \a147I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.\a148\a147Go on with your story,\a148 said Holmes, shortly.\a147Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.\a147It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, \a145the Great Mogul\a146 and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats\a146-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.\a147After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\a147Well, there\a146s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\a147It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first. This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,\a151 three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.\a147It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\a147At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.\a147The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make.\a147Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don\a146t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other\a146s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\a147One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his losses.\a147\a160\a145It\a146s all up, Morstan,\a146 he was saying, as they passed my hut. \a145I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.\a146\a147\a160\a145Nonsense, old chap!\a146 said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. \a145I\a146ve had a nasty facer myself, but\a151. That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking.\a147A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him.\a147\a160\a145I wish to have your advice, major,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Well, Small, what is it?\a146 he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\a147\a160\a145I wanted to ask you, sir,\a146 said I, \a145who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.\a146\a147\a160\a145Half a million, Small?\a146 he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest.\a147\a160\a145Quite that, sir,\a151 in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.\a146\a147\a160\a145To government, Small,\a146 he stammered,\a151\a145to government\a148. But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\a147\a160\a145You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?\a146 said I, quietly.\a147\a160\a145Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.\a146\a147I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not identify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him.\a147\a160\a145This is a very important matter, Small,\a146 he said, at last. \a145You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.\a146\a147Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern.\a147\a160\a145I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,\a146 said he.\a147I repeated it as I had told it before.\a147\a160\a145It rings true, eh?\a146 said he. \a145It\a146s good enough to act upon?\a146\a147Captain Morstan nodded.\a147\a160\a145Look here, Small,\a146 said the major. \a145We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it. We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms\a148. He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.\a147\a160\a145Why, as to that, gentlemen,\a146 I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, \a145there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Hum!\a146 said he. \a145A fifth share. That is not very tempting.\a146\a147\a160\a145It would come to fifty thousand apiece,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145But how can we gain your freedom. You know very well that you ask an impossibility.\a146\a147\a160\a145Nothing of the sort,\a146 I answered. \a145I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.\a146\a147\a160\a145If there were only one,\a146 he said.\a147\a160\a145None or all,\a146 I answered. \a145We have sworn it. The four of us must always act together.\a146\a147\a160\a145You see, Morstan,\a146 said he, \a145Small is a man of his word. He does not flinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.\a146\a147\a160\a145It\a146s a dirty business,\a146 the other answered. \a145Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, Small,\a146 said the major, \a145we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.\a146\a147\a160\a145Not so fast,\a146 said I, growing colder as he got hot. \a145I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.\a146\a147\a160\a145Nonsense!\a146 he broke in. \a145What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?\a146\a147\a160\a145Black or blue,\a146 said I, \a145they are in with me, and we all go together.\a146\a147Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major\a146s share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,\a151 that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.\a147Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I\a146ll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,\a151 nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,\a151 that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto.\a147Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me.\a147Tonga\a151 for that was his name\a151 was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.\a147He was staunch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,\a151 a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see.Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions.\a147Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me,\a151 I name no names, for I don\a146t want to get any one else in a hole,\a151 and I soon found that he still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his \ikhitmutgar\i, on guard over him.\a147One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I\a146d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however, so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\a147We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day\a146s work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\a146s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto\a146s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\a146s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come.\a147I don\a146t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith\a146s launch the \iAurora\i, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,\a151 for you have not done me a very good turn,\a151 but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\a148\a147A very remarkable account,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\a148\a147He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.\a148\a147Ah, of course,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I had not thought of that.\a148\a147Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?\a148 asked the convict, affably.\a147I think not, thank you,\a148 my companion answered.\a147Well, Holmes,\a148 said Athelney Jones, \a147You are a man to be humoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.\a148\a147Good-night, gentlemen both,\a148 said Jonathan Small.\a147You first, Small,\a148 remarked the wary Jones as they left the room. \a147I\a146ll take particular care that you don\a146t club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.\a148\a147Well, and there is the end of our little drama,\a148 I remarked, after we had set some time smoking in silence. \a147I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective.\a148He gave a most dismal groan. \a147I feared as much,\a148 said he. \a147I really cannot congratulate you.\a148I was a little hurt. \a147Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?\a148 I asked.\a147Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way; witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.\a148\a147I trust,\a148 said I, laughing, \a147that my judgement may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.\a148\a147Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for a week.\a148\a147Strange,\a148 said I, \a147how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 he answered, \a147there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those lines of old Goethe,\a151Schade dass die Natur nur \ieinen\i Mensch aus Dir schuf, Denn zum wuerdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\a147By the way, \i\a224 propos\i of this Norwood business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul.\a148\a147The division seems rather unfair,\a148 I remarked. \a147You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?\a148\a147For me,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, \a147there still remains the cocaine bottle\a148. And he stretched his long white hand up for it.\p\c\l\B\X0The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\l\c\pAdventure I\B - \X1\BA Scandal In Bohemia\B\X1\c\i\m="scan-03.png"\i\cTo Sherlock Holmes she is always \ithe\i woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\a151 excellent for drawing the veil from men\a146s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.I had seen little of Holmes since the singular chain of events which I have already narrated in a bold fashion under the heading of \iThe Sign of Four\i. My marriage had, as he foretold, drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.One night\a151 it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\a151 I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\a147Wedlock suits you,\a148 he remarked. \a147I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\a148\a147Seven!\a148 I answered.\a147Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\a148\a147Then, how do you know?\a148\a147I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\a148\a147My dear Holmes,\a148 said I, \a147this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\a146t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\a148He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\a147It is simplicity itself,\a148 said he; \a147my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\a148I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \a147When I hear you give your reasons,\a148 I remarked, \a147the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \a147You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\a148\a147Frequently.\a148\a147How often?\a148\a147Well, some hundreds of times.\a148\a147Then how many are there?\a148\a147How many? I don\a146t know.\a148\a147Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\a148 He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. \a147It came by the last post,\a148 said he. \a147Read it aloud.\a148The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\a147There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\a146clock,\a148 it said, \a147a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\a148\a147This is indeed a mystery,\a148 I remarked. \a147What do you imagine that it means?\a148\a147I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\a148I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\a147The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\a148 I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\a146s processes. \a147Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\a148\a147Peculiar\a151 that is the very word,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\a148I did so, and saw a large \iE\i with a small \ig\i, a \iP\i, and a large \iG\i with a small \it\i woven into the texture of the paper.\a147What do you make of that?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\a148\a147Not at all. The \iG\i with the small \it\i stands for \a145Gesellschaft,\a146 which is the German for \a145Company.\a146 It is a customary contraction like our \a145Co.\a146 \iP\i, of course, stands for \a145Papier.\a146 Now for the \a145\iEg\i. Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\a148 He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \a147Eglow, Eglonitz\a151 here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\a151 in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \a145Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\a146 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\a148 His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\a147The paper was made in Bohemia,\a148 I said.\a147Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\a151\a145This account of you we have from all quarters received.\a146 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\a148As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\a146 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\a147A pair, by the sound,\a148 said he. \a147Yes,\a148 he continued, glancing out of the window. \a147A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\a146s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\a148\a147I think that I had better go, Holmes.\a148\a147Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\a148\a147But your client\a151\a148\a147Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\a148A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\a147Come in!\a148 said Holmes.A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\a147You had my note?\a148 he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \a147I told you that I would call.\a148 He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\a147Pray take a seat,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\a148\a147You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\a148I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \a147It is both, or none,\a148 said he. \a147You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\a148The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \a147Then I must begin,\a148 said he, \a147by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\a148\a147I promise,\a148 said Holmes.\a147And I.\a148\a147You will excuse this mask,\a148 continued our strange visitor. \a147The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\a148\a147I was aware of it,\a148 said Holmes dryly.\a147The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\a148\a147I was also aware of that,\a148 murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\a147If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\a148 he remarked, \a147I should be better able to advise you.\a148The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \a147You are right,\a148 he cried; \a147I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\a148\a147Why, indeed?\a148 murmured Holmes. \a147Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\a148\a147But you can understand,\a148 said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \a147you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come \iincognito\i from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\a148\a147Then, pray consult,\a148 said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\a147The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\a148\a147Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\a148 murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\a147Let me see!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\a151 hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\a151 yes! Retired from operatic stage\a151 ha! Living in London\a151 quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\a148\a147Precisely so. But how\a151\a148\a147Was there a secret marriage?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147No legal papers or certificates?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\a148\a147There is the writing.\a148\a147Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\a148\a147My private note-paper.\a148\a147Stolen.\a148\a147My own seal.\a148\a147Imitated.\a148\a147My photograph.\a148\a147Bought.\a148\a147We were both in the photograph.\a148\a147Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\a148\a147I was mad\a151 insane.\a148\a147You have compromised yourself seriously.\a148\a147I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\a148\a147It must be recovered.\a148\a147We have tried and failed.\a148\a147Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\a148\a147She will not sell.\a148\a147Stolen, then.\a148\a147Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\a148\a147No sign of it?\a148\a147Absolutely none.\a148Holmes laughed. \a147It is quite a pretty little problem,\a148 said he.\a147But a very serious one to me,\a148 returned the King reproachfully.\a147Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\a148\a147To ruin me.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147I am about to be married.\a148\a147So I have heard.\a148\a147To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\a148\a147And Irene Adler?\a148\a147Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go\a151 none.\a148\a147You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\a148\a147I am sure.\a148\a147And why?\a148\a147Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\a148\a147Oh, then we have three days yet,\a148 said Holmes with a yawn. \a147That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\a148\a147Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\a148\a147Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\a148\a147Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\a148\a147Then, as to money?\a148\a147You have \icarte blanche\i.\a148\a147Absolutely?\a148\a147I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\a148\a147And for present expenses?\a148The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\a147There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\a148 he said.Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\a147And Mademoiselle\a146s address?\a148 he asked.\a147Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\a146s Wood.\a148Holmes took a note of it. \a147One other question,\a148 said he. \a147Was the photograph a cabinet?\a148\a147It was.\a148\a147Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\a148 he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \a147If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\a146clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\a148At three o\a146clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\a146clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\a146s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\a147Well, really!\a148 he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\a147What is it?\a148\a147It\a146s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\a148\a147I can\a146t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\a148\a147Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\a146clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a \ibijou\i villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\a147I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\a148\a147And what of Irene Adler?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, she has turned all the men\a146s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\a147This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\a146s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\a148\a147I am following you closely,\a148 I answered.\a147I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\a151 evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\a147He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \a145Drive like the devil,\a146 he shouted, \a145first to Gross & Hankey\a146s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\a146\a147Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\a146t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\a147\a160\a145The Church of St. Monica, John,\a146 she cried, \a145and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\a146\a147This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \a145The Church of St. Monica,\a146 said I, \a145and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\a146 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\a147My cabby drove fast. I don\a146t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\a147\a160\a145Thank God,\a146 he cried. \a145You\a146ll do. Come! Come!\a146\a147\a160\a145What then?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\a146t be legal.\a146\a147I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\a148\a147This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\a148 said I; \a147and what then?\a148\a147Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \a145I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\a146 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\a148\a147Which are?\a148\a147Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\a148 he answered, ringing the bell. \a147I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\a148\a147I shall be delighted.\a148\a147You don\a146t mind breaking the law?\a148\a147Not in the least.\a148\a147Nor running a chance of arrest?\a148\a147Not in a good cause.\a148\a147Oh, the cause is excellent!\a148\a147Then I am your man.\a148\a147I was sure that I might rely on you.\a148\a147But what is it you wish?\a148\a147When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\a148 he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \a147I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\a148\a147And what then?\a148\a147You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\a148\a147I am to be neutral?\a148\a147To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And when I raise my hand\a151 so\a151 you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\a148\a147Entirely.\a148\a147It is nothing very formidable,\a148 he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \a147It is an ordinary plumber\a146s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\a148\a147I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147Then you may entirely rely on me.\a148\a147That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new \ir\a244le\i I have to play.\a148He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\a146 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\a147You see,\a148 remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \a147this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\a148\a147Where, indeed?\a148\a147It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\a146s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\a148\a147Where, then?\a148\a147Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\a148\a147But it has twice been burgled.\a148\a147Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\a148\a147But how will you look?\a148\a147I will not look.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147I will get her to show me.\a148\a147But she will refuse.\a148\a147She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\a148As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\a147Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\a148 she asked.\a147He is dead,\a148 cried several voices.\a147No, no, there\a146s life in him!\a148 shouted another. \a147But he\a146ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\a148\a147He\a146s a brave fellow,\a148 said a woman. \a147They would have had the lady\a146s purse and watch if it hadn\a146t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\a146s breathing now.\a148\a147He can\a146t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\a148\a147Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\a148Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had entrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \a147Fire!\a148 The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\a151 gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids\a151 joined in a general shriek of \a147Fire!\a148 Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\a146s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\a147You did it very nicely, Doctor,\a148 he remarked. \a147Nothing could have been better. It is all right.\a148\a147You have the photograph?\a148\a147I know where it is.\a148\a147And how did you find out?\a148\a147She showed me, as I told you she would.\a148\a147I am still in the dark.\a148\a147I do not wish to make a mystery,\a148 said he, laughing. \a147The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\a148\a147I guessed as much.\a148\a147Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\a148\a147That also I could fathom.\a148\a147Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\a148\a147How did that help you?\a148\a147It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\a148\a147And now?\a148 I asked.\a147Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\a148\a147And when will you call?\a148\a147At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\a148We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\a147Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\a148There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\a147I\a146ve heard that voice before,\a148 said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \a147Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\a148I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\a147You have really got it!\a148 he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\a147Not yet.\a148\a147But you have hopes?\a148\a147I have hopes.\a148\a147Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\a148\a147We must have a cab.\a148\a147No, my brougham is waiting.\a148\a147Then that will simplify matters.\a148 We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\a147Irene Adler is married,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147Married! When?\a148\a147Yesterday.\a148\a147But to whom?\a148\a147To an English lawyer named Norton.\a148\a147But she could not love him.\a148\a147I am in hopes that she does.\a148\a147And why in hopes?\a148\a147Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\a146s plan.\a148\a147It is true. And yet\a151 Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\a148 He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\a148 said she.\a147I am Mr. Holmes,\a148 answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\a147Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\a148\a147What!\a148 Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \a147Do you mean that she has left England?\a148\a147Never to return.\a148\a147And the papers?\a148 asked the King hoarsely. \a147All is lost.\a148\a147We shall see.\a148 He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \a147Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\a148 My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\a147MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\a151 You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\a147Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\a147We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Very truly yours,IRENE NORTON, \in\a233e\i ADLER.\a148\a147What a woman\a151 oh, what a woman!\a148 cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \a147Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\a148\a147From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\a148 said Holmes coldly. \a147I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\a146s business to a more successful conclusion.\a148\a147On the contrary, my dear sir,\a148 cried the King; \a147nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\a148\a147I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\a148\a147I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring\a151\a148 He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\a147Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\a148 said Holmes.\a147You have but to name it.\a148\a147This photograph!\a148The King stared at him in amazement.\a147Irene\a146s photograph!\a148 he cried. \a147Certainly, if you wish it.\a148\a147I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\a148 He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\a146s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of \ithe\i woman.\p\BAdventure II\B - \X1\BThe Red-Headed League\B\X1\c\i\m="redh-09.png"\i\cI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\a147You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\a148 he said cordially.\a147I was afraid that you were engaged.\a148\a147So I am. Very much so.\a148\a147Then I can wait in the next room.\a148\a147Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\a148The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\a147Try the settee,\a148 said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \a147I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\a148\a147Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\a148 I observed.\a147You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\a148\a147A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\a148\a147You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\a148The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\a146s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.Sherlock Holmes\a146 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \a147Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\a148Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\a147How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked. \a147How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\a146s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\a146s carpenter.\a148\a147Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\a148\a147Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\a148\a147I won\a146t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\a148\a147Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\a148\a147What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\a148\a147Well, but China?\a148\a147The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\a146 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\a148Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \a147Well, I never!\a148 said he. \a147I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.\a148\a147I begin to think, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that I make a mistake in explaining. \a145Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\a146 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\a148\a147Yes, I have got it now,\a148 he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \a147Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\a148I took the paper from him and read as follows:\a147TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\a146clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\a146s Court, Fleet Street.\a148\a147What on earth does this mean?\a148 I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \a147It is a little off the beaten track, isn\a146t it?\a148 said he. \a147And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\a148\a147It is \iThe Morning Chronicle\i of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\a148\a147Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\a148\a147Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \a147I have a small pawnbroker\a146s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\a146s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\a148\a147What is the name of this obliging youth?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes.\a147His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\a146s not such a youth, either. It\a146s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\a148\a147Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\a187 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\a146t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\a148\a147Oh, he has his faults, too,\a148 said Mr. Wilson. \a147Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\a146s a good worker. There\a146s no vice in him.\a148\a147He is still with you, I presume?\a148\a147Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\a151 that\a146s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\a147The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\a147\a160\a145I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why that?\a146 I asks. \a147\a160\a145Why,\a146 says he, \a145here\a146s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\a146s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\a146 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\a146s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why, what is it, then?\a146 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\a146t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\a147\a160\a145Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\a146 he asked with his eyes open.\a147\a160\a145Never.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\a146\a147\a160\a145And what are they worth?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\a146s other occupations.\a146\a147Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\a147\a160\a145Tell me all about it,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said he, showing me the advertisement, \a145you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145But,\a146 said I, \a145there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\a146\a147\a160\a145Not so many as you might think,\a146 he answered. \a145You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\a146\a147Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\a147I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\a146s Court looked like a coster\a146s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\a151 straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\a148\a147Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\a148 remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \a147Pray continue your very interesting statement.\a148\a147There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\a147\a160\a145This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\a146 said my assistant, \a145and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\a146\a147\a160\a145And he is admirably suited for it,\a146 the other answered. \a145He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\a146 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\a147\a160\a145It would be injustice to hesitate,\a146 said he. \a145You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\a146 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \a145There is water in your eyes,\a146 said he as he released me. \a145I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\a146s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\a146 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\a147\a160\a145My name,\a146 said he, \a145is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\a146\a147I answered that I had not.\a147His face fell immediately.\a147\a160\a145Dear me!\a146 he said gravely, \a145that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\a146\a147My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\a147\a160\a145In the case of another,\a146 said he, \a145the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\a146 said Vincent Spaulding. \a145I should be able to look after that for you.\a146\a147\a160\a145What would be the hours?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Ten to two.\a146\a147Now a pawnbroker\a146s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\a147\a160\a145That would suit me very well,\a146 said I. \a145And the pay?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is 4 pounds a week.\a146\a147\a160\a145And the work?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is purely nominal.\a146\a147\a160\a145What do you call purely nominal?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\a146t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\a146\a147\a160\a145It\a146s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145No excuse will avail,\a146 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \a145neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\a146\a147\a160\a145And the work?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is to copy out the \iEncyclopaedia Britannica\i. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly,\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\a146 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\a147Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the \a145Encyclopaedia Britannica.\a146 Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\a146s Court.\a147Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\a146clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\a147This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\a146s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\a147Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\a146s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\a148\a147To an end?\a148\a147Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\a146clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\a148 He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\c\iTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\i\c\c\iIS\i\c\c\iDISSOLVED.\i\c\c\iOctober 9, 1890.\i\cSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\a147I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\a148 cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \a147If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\a148\a147No, no,\a148 cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \a147I really wouldn\a146t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\a148\a147I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said I, \a145the gentleman at No. 4.\a146\a147\a160\a145What, the red-headed man?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh,\a146 said he, \a145his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where could I find him?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\a146s.\a146\a147I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\a148\a147And what did you do then?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\a148\a147And you did very wisely,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\a148\a147Grave enough!\a148 said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \a147Why, I have lost four pound a week.\a148\a147As far as you are personally concerned,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\a148\a147No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank\a151 if it was a prank\a151 upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\a148\a147We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement\a151 how long had he been with you?\a148\a147About a month then.\a148\a147How did he come?\a148\a147In answer to an advertisement.\a148\a147Was he the only applicant?\a148\a147No, I had a dozen.\a148\a147Why did you pick him?\a148\a147Because he was handy and would come cheap.\a148\a147At half-wages, in fact.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\a148\a147Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\a146s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\a148Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \a147I thought as much,\a148 said he. \a147Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\a148\a147Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\a148\a147Hum!\a148 said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \a147He is still with you?\a148\a147Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\a148\a147And has your business been attended to in your absence?\a148\a147Nothing to complain of, sir. There\a146s never very much to do of a morning.\a148\a147That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\a148\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \a147what do you make of it all?\a148\a147I make nothing of it,\a148 I answered frankly. \a147It is a most mysterious business.\a148\a147As a rule,\a148 said Holmes, \a147the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\a148\a147What are you going to do, then?\a148 I asked.\a147To smoke,\a148 he answered. \a147It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\a146t speak to me for fifty minutes.\a148 He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\a147Sarasate plays at the St. James\a146s Hall this afternoon,\a148 he remarked. \a147What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\a148\a147I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\a148\a147Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\a148We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \a147JABEZ WILSON\a148 in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\a146s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\a148\a147Third right, fourth left,\a148 answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\a147Smart fellow, that,\a148 observed Holmes as we walked away. \a147He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\a148\a147Evidently,\a148 said I, \a147Mr. Wilson\a146s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\a148\a147Not him.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147The knees of his trousers.\a148\a147And what did you see?\a148\a147What I expected to see.\a148\a147Why did you beat the pavement?\a148\a147My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\a146s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\a148The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\a147Let me see,\a148 said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \a147I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\a146s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\a146s carriage-building \idep\a244t\i. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\a146ve done our work, so it\a146s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\a148My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\a146s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\a147You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\a148 he remarked as we emerged.\a147Yes, it would be as well.\a148\a147And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\a148\a147Why serious?\a148\a147A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\a148\a147At what time?\a148\a147Ten will be early enough.\a148\a147I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\a148\a147Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\a148 He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \a147Encyclopaedia\a148 down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\a146s assistant was a formidable man\a151 a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\a147Ha! Our party is complete,\a148 said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \a147Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\a146s adventure.\a148\a147We\a146re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\a148 said Jones in his consequential way. \a147Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\a148\a147I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\a148 observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\a147You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\a148 said the police agent loftily. \a147He has his own little methods, which are, if he won\a146t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\a148\a147Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\a148 said the stranger with deference. \a147Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\a148\a147I think you will find,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, \a147that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\a148\a147John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\a146s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\a146s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\a146ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\a146ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\a148\a147I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\a146ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\a148Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\a147We are close there now,\a148 my friend remarked. \a147This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\a148We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\a147You are not very vulnerable from above,\a148 Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\a147Nor from below,\a148 said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \a147Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\a148 he remarked, looking up in surprise.\a147I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\a148 said Holmes severely. \a147You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\a148The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\a147We have at least an hour before us,\a148 he remarked, \a147for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\a151 as no doubt you have divined\a151 in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\a148\a147It is our French gold,\a148 whispered the director. \a147We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\a148\a147Your French gold?\a148\a147Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\a148\a147Which were very well justified,\a148 observed Holmes. \a147And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\a148\a147And sit in the dark?\a148\a147I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a \ipartie carr\a233e\i, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\a146s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\a148I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness\a151 such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\a146s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\a147They have but one retreat,\a148 whispered Holmes. \a147That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\a148\a147I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\a148\a147Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\a148What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\a147It\a146s all clear,\a148 he whispered. \a147Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\a146ll swing for it!\a148Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\a146 hunting crop came down on the man\a146s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\a147It\a146s no use, John Clay,\a148 said Holmes blandly. \a147You have no chance at all.\a148\a147So I see,\a148 the other answered with the utmost coolness. \a147I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\a148\a147There are three men waiting for him at the door,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\a148\a147And I you,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\a148\a147You\a146ll see your pal again presently,\a148 said Jones. \a147He\a146s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\a148\a147I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\a148 remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \a147You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \a145sir\a146 and \a145please.\a146\a160\a148\a147All right,\a148 said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \a147Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\a148\a147That is better,\a148 said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\a147Really, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \a147I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\a148\a147I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\a148\a147You see, Watson,\a148 he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \a147it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the \iEncyclopaedia\i, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\a146s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\a146s hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\a148\a147But how could you guess what the motive was?\a148\a147Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\a146s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\a146s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar\a151 something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\a147So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\a146s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\a148\a147And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\a146s presence\a151 in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\a148\a147You reasoned it out beautifully,\a148 I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \a147It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\a148\a147It saved me from ennui,\a148 he answered, yawning. \a147Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\a148\a147And you are a benefactor of the race,\a148 said I.He shrugged his shoulders. \a147Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\a148 he remarked. \a147\a160\a145L\a146homme c\a146est rien\a151 l\a146oeuvre c\a146est tout,\a146 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\a148\p\BAdventure III\B - \X1\BA Case Of Identity\B\X1\c\i\m="iden-01.png"\i\c\a147My dear fellow,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \a147life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most \ioutr\a233\i results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\a148\a147And yet I am not convinced of it,\a148 I answered. \a147The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\a148\a147A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\a148I smiled and shook my head. \a147I can quite understand your thinking so.\a148 I said. \a147Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\a148\a151 I picked up the morning paper from the ground\a151\a147let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \a145A husband\a146s cruelty to his wife.\a146 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\a148\a147Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\a148 said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \a147This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\a148He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\a147Ah,\a148 said he, \a147I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\a148\a147And the ring?\a148 I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\a147It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\a148\a147And have you any on hand just now?\a148 I asked with interest.\a147Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\a148He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\a147I have seen those symptoms before,\a148 said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \a147Oscillation upon the pavement always means an \iaffaire du coeur\i. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\a148As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\a147Do you not find,\a148 he said, \a147that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\a148\a147I did at first,\a148 she answered, \a147but now I know where the letters are without looking.\a148 Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \a147You\a146ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\a148 she cried, \a147else how could you know all that?\a148\a147Never mind,\a148 said Holmes, laughing; \a147it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\a148\a147I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\a146m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \a147Yes, I did bang out of the house,\a148 she said, \a147for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\a151 that is, my father\a151 took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\a148\a147Your father,\a148 said Holmes, \a147your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\a148\a147Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\a148\a147And your mother is alive?\a148\a147Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\a146t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\a146s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\a146t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\a148I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\a147Your own little income,\a148 he asked, \a147does it come out of the business?\a148\a147Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\a206\a169 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\a148\a147You interest me extremely,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.\a148\a147I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\a146t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\a148\a147You have made your position very clear to me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148A flush stole over Miss Sutherland\a146s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \a147I met him first at the gasfitters\a146 ball,\a148 she said. \a147They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\a146s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147I suppose,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\a148\a147Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\a148\a147I see. Then at the gasfitters\a146 ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him\a151 that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\a148\a147No?\a148\a147Well, you know father didn\a146t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\a146t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\a148\a147But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\a148\a147Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\a148\a147Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\a148\a147Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer\a151 Mr. Angel\a151 was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street\a151 and\a151\a148\a147What office?\a148\a147That\a146s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\a146t know.\a148\a147Where did he live, then?\a148\a147He slept on the premises.\a148\a147And you don\a146t know his address?\a148\a147No\a151 except that it was Leadenhall Street.\a148\a147Where did you address your letters, then?\a148\a147To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\a146t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\a148\a147It was most suggestive,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\a148\a147He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\a146d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\a148\a147Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\a148\a147Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\a146t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\a146t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\a148\a147It missed him, then?\a148\a147Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\a148\a147Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\a148\a147Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\a146s, near King\a146s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\a148\a147It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\a148\a147Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\a148\a147But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\a148\a147She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\a148\a147And your father? Did you tell him?\a148\a147Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\a146t sleep a wink at night.\a148 She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\a147I shall glance into the case for you,\a148 said Holmes, rising, \a147and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\a148\a147Then you don\a146t think I\a146ll see him again?\a148\a147I fear not.\a148\a147Then what has happened to him?\a148\a147You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\a148\a147I advertised for him in last Saturday\a146s \iChronicle\i,\a148 said she. \a147Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\a148\a147Thank you. And your address?\a148\a147No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\a148\a147Mr. Angel\a146s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\a146s place of business?\a148\a147He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\a148\a147Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\a148\a147You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\a148For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\a147Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\a148 he observed. \a147I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \a14677, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\a148\a147You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\a148 I remarked.\a147Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\a146s appearance? Describe it.\a148\a147Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\a146t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\a148Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\a147\a146Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\a146s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\a148\a147It surprised me.\a148\a147But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\a148\a147And what else?\a148 I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\a146s incisive reasoning.\a147I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\a148I held the little printed slip to the light.\a147Missing,\a148 it said, \a147on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft 7 in in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing\a151\a148\a147That will do,\a148 said Holmes. \a147As to the letters,\a148 he continued, glancing over them, \a147they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\a148\a147They are typewritten,\a148 I remarked.\a147Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \a145Hosmer Angel\a146 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive\a151 in fact, we may call it conclusive.\a148\a147Of what?\a148\a147My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\a148\a147I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\a148\a147No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\a146s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\a146clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\a148I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\a146s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\a146clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the \id\a195\a136nouement\i of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\a147Well, have you solved it?\a148 I asked as I entered.\a147Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\a148\a147No, no, the mystery!\a148 I cried.\a147Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\a148\a147Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\a148The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\a147This is the girl\a146s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\a148The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\a147Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\a146clock?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 said Holmes quietly; \a147I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \a147I am delighted to hear it,\a148 he said.\a147It is a curious thing,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\a146s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \a145e,\a146 and a slight defect in the tail of the \a145r.\a146 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\a148\a147We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\a148 our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\a147And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\a148 Holmes continued. \a147I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \a145e\a146s\a146 slurred and the \a145r\a146s\a146 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\a148Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \a147I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\a148\a147Certainly,\a148 said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \a147I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\a148\a147What! where?\a148 shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\a147Oh, it won\a146t do\a151 really it won\a146t,\a148 said Holmes suavely. \a147There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\a146s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\a148Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \a147It\a151 it\a146s not actionable,\a148 he stammered.\a147I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\a148The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\a147The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\a148 said he, \a147and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\a146s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\a148\a147It was only a joke at first,\a148 groaned our visitor. \a147We never thought that she would have been so carried away.\a148\a147Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\a146s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\a146s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\a146s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\a148Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\a147It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\a148\a147The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\a148 said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \a147yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\a148 he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\a146s face, \a147it is not part of my duties to my client, but here\a146s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to\a151\a148 He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\a147There\a146s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\a148 said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \a147That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\a148\a147I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\a148 I remarked.\a147Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\a148\a147And how did you verify them?\a148\a147Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\a151 the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. \iVoil\a226\a128\a161 tout!\i\a148\a147And Miss Sutherland?\a148\a147If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \a145There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\a146 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\a148\p\BAdventure IV\B - \X1\BThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\B\X1\c\i\m="bosc-02.png"\i\cWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\a147Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\a148\a147What do you say, dear?\a148 said my wife, looking across at me. \a147Will you go?\a148\a147I really don\a146t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\a148\a147Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a146s cases.\a148\a147I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\a148 I answered. \a147But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\a148My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\a147It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\a148We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\a147Have you heard anything of the case?\a148 he asked.\a147Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\a148\a147The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\a148\a147That sounds a little paradoxical.\a148\a147But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\a148\a147It is a murder, then?\a148\a147Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\a147Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\a151 a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\a147On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\a147From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\a147The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\a146s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \a145wilful murder\a146 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\a148\a147I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\a148 I remarked. \a147If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\a148\a147Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\a148 answered Holmes thoughtfully. \a147It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\a148\a147I am afraid,\a148 said I, \a147that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\a148\a147There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\a148 he answered, laughing. \a147Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\a148\a147How on earth\a151\a148\a147My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my \im\a233tier\i, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\a148\a147What are they?\a148\a147It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\a146s jury.\a148\a147It was a confession,\a148 I ejaculated.\a147No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\a148\a147Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 said Holmes, \a147it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\a148I shook my head. \a147Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\a148 I remarked.\a147So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\a148\a147What is the young man\a146s own account of the matter?\a148\a147It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\a148He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\a147Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \a145I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \a147Cooee!\a148 which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\a146s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\a146\a147The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\a147Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\a147The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\a147Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\a147The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\a147Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\a147The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\a147Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\a147The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\a147Witness: I must still refuse.\a147The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \a145Cooee\a146 was a common signal between you and your father?\a147Witness: It was.\a147The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\a147Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\a147A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\a147Witness: Nothing definite.\a147The Coroner: What do you mean?\a147Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\a147\a160\a145Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, it was gone.\a146\a147\a160\a145You cannot say what it was?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I had a feeling something was there.\a146\a147\a160\a145How far from the body?\a146\a147\a160\a145A dozen yards or so.\a146\a147\a160\a145And how far from the edge of the wood?\a146\a147\a160\a145About the same.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, but with my back towards it.\a146\a147This concluded the examination of the witness.\a148\a147I see,\a148 said I as I glanced down the column, \a147that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\a146s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\a148Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \a147Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,\a148 said he, \a147to single out the very strongest points in the young man\a146s favour. Don\a146t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so \ioutr\a233\i as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\a148It was nearly four o\a146clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\a147I have ordered a carriage,\a148 said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \a147I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\a148\a147It was very nice and complimentary of you,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\a148Lestrade looked startled. \a147I do not quite follow,\a148 he said.\a147How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\a148Lestrade laughed indulgently. \a147You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\a148 he said. \a147The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\a146t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\a148He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\a147Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\a148 she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\a146s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \a147I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\a146t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\a148\a147I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\a148\a147But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\a148\a147I think that it is very probable.\a148\a147There, now!\a148 she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \a147You hear! He gives me hopes.\a148Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \a147I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\a148 he said.\a147But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\a148\a147In what way?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and\a151 and\a151 well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\a148\a147And your father?\a148 asked Holmes. \a147Was he in favour of such a union?\a148\a147No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\a148 A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\a147Thank you for this information,\a148 said he. \a147May I see your father if I call to-morrow?\a148\a147I am afraid the doctor won\a146t allow it.\a148\a147The doctor?\a148\a147Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\a148\a147Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\a148\a147Yes, at the mines.\a148\a147Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\a148\a147Yes, certainly.\a148\a147Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\a148\a147You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\a148\a147I will, Miss Turner.\a148\a147I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\a148 She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\a147I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\a148 said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\a146 silence. \a147Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\a148\a147I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Have you an order to see him in prison?\a148\a147Yes, but only for you and me.\a148\a147Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\a148\a147Ample.\a148\a147Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\a148I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\a146s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\a146s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\a146 attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\a146s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\a146 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\a146s innocence.It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\a147The glass still keeps very high,\a148 he remarked as he sat down. \a147It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\a148\a147And what did you learn from him?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147Could he throw no light?\a148\a147None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\a148\a147I cannot admire his taste,\a148 I remarked, \a147if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\a148\a147Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\a148\a147But if he is innocent, who has done it?\a148\a147Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \a145Cooee!\a146 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\a148There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\a146clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\a147There is serious news this morning,\a148 Lestrade observed. \a147It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\a148\a147An elderly man, I presume?\a148 said Holmes.\a147About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\a146s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\a148\a147Indeed! That is interesting,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\a148\a147Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\a146s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\a148\a147We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\a148 said Lestrade, winking at me. \a147I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\a148\a147You are right,\a148 said Holmes demurely; \a147you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\a148\a147Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\a148 replied Lestrade with some warmth.\a147And that is\a151\a148\a147That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\a148\a147Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\a148\a147Yes, that is it.\a148 It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\a146 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\a146s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little \id\a233tour\i into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\a146s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\a147What did you go into the pool for?\a148 he asked.\a147I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\a151\a148\a147Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\a148 He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \a147These are young McCarthy\a146s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\a146s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again\a151 of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\a148 He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\a147It has been a case of considerable interest,\a148 he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \a147I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\a148It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\a147This may interest you, Lestrade,\a148 he remarked, holding it out. \a147The murder was done with it.\a148\a147I see no marks.\a148\a147There are none.\a148\a147How do you know, then?\a148\a147The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\a148\a147And the murderer?\a148\a147Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\a148Lestrade laughed. \a147I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\a148 he said. \a147Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\a148\a147Nous verrons,\a148 answered Holmes calmly. \a147You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\a148\a147And leave your case unfinished?\a148\a147No, finished.\a148\a147But the mystery?\a148\a147It is solved.\a148\a147Who was the criminal, then?\a148\a147The gentleman I describe.\a148\a147But who is he?\a148\a147Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\a148Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \a147I am a practical man,\a148 he said, \a147and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\a148\a147All right,\a148 said Holmes quietly. \a147I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\a148Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\a147Look here, Watson,\a148 he said when the cloth was cleared \a147just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\a146t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\a148\a147Pray do so.\a148\a147Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\a146s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \a145Cooee!\a146 before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\a146s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\a148\a147What of this \a145Cooee!\a146 then?\a148\a147Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \a145Cooee!\a146 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \a145Cooee\a146 is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\a148\a147What of the rat, then?\a148Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \a147This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\a148 he said. \a147I wired to Bristol for it last night.\a148 He put his hand over part of the map. \a147What do you read?\a148\a147ARAT,\a148 I read.\a147And now?\a148 He raised his hand.\a147BALLARAT.\a148\a147Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\a148\a147It is wonderful!\a148 I exclaimed.\a147It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\a146s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\a148\a147Quite so.\a148\a147Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\a148\a147But how did you gain them?\a148\a147You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\a148\a147His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\a148\a147Yes, they were peculiar boots.\a148\a147But his lameness?\a148\a147The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\a151 he was lame.\a148\a147But his left-handedness.\a148\a147You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\a148\a147And the cigar-holder?\a148\a147I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\a148\a147Holmes,\a148 I said, \a147you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is\a151\a148\a147Mr. John Turner,\a148 cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\a147Pray sit down on the sofa,\a148 said Holmes gently. \a147You had my note?\a148\a147Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\a148\a147I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\a148 \a147And why did you wish to see me?\a148 He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\a147Yes,\a148 said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \a147It is so. I know all about McCarthy.\a148The old man sank his face in his hands. \a147God help me!\a148 he cried. \a147But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\a148\a147I am glad to hear you say so,\a148 said Holmes gravely.\a147I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart\a151 it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\a148\a147It may not come to that,\a148 said Holmes.\a147What?\a148\a147I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\a148\a147I am a dying man,\a148 said old Turner. \a147I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\a148Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \a147Just tell us the truth,\a148 he said. \a147I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\a148\a147It\a146s as well,\a148 said the old man; \a147it\a146s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\a147You didn\a146t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\a146ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\a147It was in the early \a14660\a146s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\a147One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\a147I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\a147\a160\a145Here we are, Jack,\a146 says he, touching me on the arm; \a145we\a146ll be as good as a family to you. There\a146s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\a146t\a151 it\a146s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\a146s always a policeman within hail.\a146\a147Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\a147His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\a147When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\a148\a147Well, it is not for me to judge you,\a148 said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \a147I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\a148\a147I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\a148\a147In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\a148\a147Farewell, then,\a148 said the old man solemnly. \a147Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\a148 Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\a147God help us!\a148 said Holmes after a long silence. \a147Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\a146s words, and say, \a145There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a160\a148James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\p\BAdventure V\B - \X1\BThe Five Orange Pips\B\X1\c\i\m="five-01.png"\i\cWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \a14682 and \a14690, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.The year \a14687 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque \iSophy Anderson\i, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\a146s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\a151 a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\a146s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\a146s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\a147Why,\a148 said I, glancing up at my companion, \a147that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\a148\a147Except yourself I have none,\a148 he answered. \a147I do not encourage visitors.\a148\a147A client, then?\a148\a147If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\a146s.\a148Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\a147Come in!\a148 said he.The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\a147I owe you an apology,\a148 he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \a147I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\a148\a147Give me your coat and umbrella,\a148 said Holmes. \a147They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\a148\a147Yes, from Horsham.\a148\a147That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\a148\a147I have come for advice.\a148\a147That is easily got.\a148\a147And help.\a148\a147That is not always so easy.\a148\a147I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\a148\a147Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\a148\a147He said that you could solve anything.\a148\a147He said too much.\a148\a147That you are never beaten.\a148\a147I have been beaten four times\a151 three times by men, and once by a woman.\a148\a147But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\a148\a147It is true that I have been generally successful.\a148\a147Then you may be so with me.\a148\a147I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\a148\a147It is no ordinary one.\a148\a147None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\a148\a147And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\a148\a147You fill me with interest,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\a148The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\a147My name,\a148 said he, \a147is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\a147You must know that my grandfather had two sons\a151 my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\a147My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\a146s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\a147He didn\a146t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\a146s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\a147One day\a151 it was in March, 1883\a151 a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\a146s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \a145From India!\a146 said he as he took it up, \a145Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\a146 Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \a145K. K. K.!\a146 he shrieked, and then, \a145My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\a146\a147\a160\a145What is it, uncle?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Death,\a146 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\a147\a160\a145They may do what they like, but I\a146ll checkmate them still,\a146 said he with an oath. \a145Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\a146\a147I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\a147\a160\a145I wish you, John,\a146 said my uncle, \a145to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\a146t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\a146\a147I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\a147Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \a145suicide\a146. But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 Holmes interposed, \a147your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\a148\a147The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\a148\a147Thank you. Pray proceed.\a148\a147When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \a145Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\a146 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\a146s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\a147Well, it was the beginning of \a14684 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \a14685. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\a147\a160\a145Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\a146 he stammered.\a147My heart had turned to lead. \a145It is K. K. K.,\a146 said I.\a147He looked inside the envelope. \a145So it is,\a146 he cried. \a145Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\a146\a147\a160\a145Put the papers on the sundial,\a146 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\a147\a160\a145What papers? What sundial?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\a146 said I; \a145but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\a146\a147\a160\a145Pooh!\a146 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \a145We are in a civilised land here, and we can\a146t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\a146\a147\a160\a145From Dundee,\a146 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\a147\a160\a145Some preposterous practical joke,\a146 said he. \a145What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should certainly speak to the police,\a146 I said.\a147\a160\a145And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then let me do so?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I forbid you. I won\a146t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\a146\a147It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\a147On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \a145death from accidental causes.\a146 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\a147In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\a146s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\a147It was in January, \a14685, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\a148The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\a147This is the envelope,\a148 he continued. \a147The postmark is London\a151 eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\a146s last message: \a145K. K. K.\a146; and then \a145Put the papers on the sundial.\a146\a160\a148\a147What have you done?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Nothing.\a148\a147Nothing?\a148\a147To tell the truth\a148\a151 he sank his face into his thin, white hands\a151\a147I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\a148\a147Tut! tut!\a148 cried Sherlock Holmes. \a147You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\a148\a147I have seen the police.\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\a148Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \a147Incredible imbecility!\a148 he cried.\a147They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\a148\a147Has he come with you to-night?\a148\a147No. His orders were to stay in the house.\a148Again Holmes raved in the air.\a147Why did you come to me,\a148 he cried, \a147and, above all, why did you not come at once?\a148\a147I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\a148\a147It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us\a151 no suggestive detail which might help us?\a148\a147There is one thing,\a148 said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \a147I have some remembrance,\a148 said he, \a147that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\a146s.\a148Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \a147March, 1869,\a148 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\a1474th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\a1477th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St. Augustine.\a1479th. McCauley cleared.\a14710th. John Swain cleared.\a14712th. Visited Paramore. All well.\a148\a147Thank you!\a148 said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \a147And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\a148\a147What shall I do?\a148\a147There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\a148\a147Entirely.\a148\a147Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\a148\a147I thank you,\a148 said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \a147You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\a148\a147Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\a148\a147By train from Waterloo.\a148\a147It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\a148\a147I am armed.\a148\a147That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\a148\a147I shall see you at Horsham, then?\a148\a147No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\a148\a147Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\a148 He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements\a151 blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\a151 and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\a147I think, Watson,\a148 he remarked at last, \a147that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\a148\a147Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\a148\a147Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\a148\a147But have you,\a148 I asked, \a147formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\a148\a147There can be no question as to their nature,\a148 he answered.\a147Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\a148Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \a147The ideal reasoner,\a148 he remarked, \a147would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 I answered, laughing. \a147It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\a148Holmes grinned at the last item. \a147Well,\a148 he said, \a147I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the \a145American Encyclopaedia\a146 which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\a148\a147The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\a148\a147From East London. What do you deduce from that?\a148\a147They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\a148\a147Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability\a151 the strong probability\a151 is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\a148\a147A greater distance to travel.\a148\a147But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\a148\a147Then I do not see the point.\a148\a147There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\a148\a147It is possible.\a148\a147More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\a148\a147Good God!\a148 I cried. \a147What can it mean, this relentless persecution?\a148\a147The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\a146s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\a148\a147But of what society?\a148\a147Have you never\a151\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice\a151\a147have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\a148\a147I never have.\a148Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \a147Here it is,\a148 said he presently:\a147\a160\a145Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape\a151 a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\a146\a147You will observe,\a148 said Holmes, laying down the volume, \a147that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\a148\a147Then the page we have seen\a151\a148\a147Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \a145sent the pips to A, B, and C\a146\a151 that is, sent the society\a146s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.\a148It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\a147You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\a148 said he; \a147I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\a146s.\a148\a147What steps will you take?\a148 I asked.\a147It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\a148\a147You will not go there first?\a148\a147No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\a148As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\a147Holmes,\a148 I cried, \a147you are too late.\a148\a147Ah!\a148 said he, laying down his cup, \a147I feared as much. How was it done?\a148 He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\a147My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \a145Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\a146 Here is the account:\a147Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\a148We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\a147That hurts my pride, Watson,\a148 he said at last. \a147It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\a151!\a148 He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\a147They must be cunning devils,\a148 he exclaimed at last. \a147How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\a148\a147To the police?\a148\a147No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\a148All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\a146clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\a147You are hungry,\a148 I remarked.\a147Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\a148\a147Nothing?\a148\a147Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\a148\a147And how have you succeeded?\a148\a147Well.\a148\a147You have a clue?\a148\a147I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\a148\a147What do you mean?\a148He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \a147S. H. for J. O.\a148 Then he sealed it and addressed it to \a147Captain James Calhoun, Barque \iLone Star\i, Savannah, Georgia.\a148\a147That will await him when he enters port,\a148 said he, chuckling. \a147It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\a148\a147And who is this Captain Calhoun?\a148\a147The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\a148\a147How did you trace it, then?\a148He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\a147I have spent the whole day,\a148 said he, \a147over Lloyd\a146s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \a14683. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the \iLone Star\i, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\a148\a147Texas, I think.\a148\a147I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque \iLone Star\i was there in January, \a14685, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\a148\a147Yes?\a148\a147The \iLone Star\i had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\a148\a147What will you do, then?\a148\a147Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\a148There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the \iLone Star\i of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \a147L. S.\a148 carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the \iLone Star\i.\p\BAdventure VI\B - \X1\BThe Man With The Twisted Lip\B\X1\c\i\m="twis-05.png"\i\cIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\a146s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\a146s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.One night\a151 it was in June, \a14689\a151 there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\a147A patient!\a148 said she. \a147You\a146ll have to go out.\a148I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\a147You will excuse my calling so late,\a148 she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\a146s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \a147Oh, I\a146m in such trouble!\a148 she cried; \a147I do so want a little help.\a148\a147Why,\a148 said my wife, pulling up her veil, \a147it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\a148\a147I didn\a146t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\a148 That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\a147It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\a148\a147Oh, no, no! I want the doctor\a146s advice and help, too. It\a146s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\a148It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\a146s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\a146s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\a147Thank you. I have not come to stay,\a148 said I. \a147There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\a148There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\a147My God! It\a146s Watson,\a148 said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \a147I say, Watson, what o\a146clock is it?\a148\a147Nearly eleven.\a148\a147Of what day?\a148\a147Of Friday, June 19th.\a148\a147Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\a146you want to frighten a chap for?\a148 He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\a147I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\a148\a147So I am. But you\a146ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes\a151 I forget how many. But I\a146ll go home with you. I wouldn\a146t frighten Kate\a151 poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\a148\a147Yes, I have one waiting.\a148\a147Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\a148I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \a147Walk past me, and then look back at me.\a148 The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\a147Holmes!\a148 I whispered, \a147what on earth are you doing in this den?\a148\a147As low as you can,\a148 he answered; \a147I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\a148\a147I have a cab outside.\a148\a147Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\a148It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\a146 requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\a146s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\a147I suppose, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\a148\a147I was certainly surprised to find you there.\a148\a147But not more so than I to find you.\a148\a147I came to find a friend.\a148\a147And I to find an enemy.\a148\a147An enemy?\a148\a147Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\a146s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\a146s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\a148\a147What! You do not mean bodies?\a148\a147Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\a148 He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\a151 a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\a146 hoofs.\a147Now, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \a147You\a146ll come with me, won\a146t you?\a148\a147If I can be of use.\a148\a147Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\a148\a147The Cedars?\a148\a147Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair\a146s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\a148\a147Where is it, then?\a148\a147Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\a148\a147But I am all in the dark.\a148\a147Of course you are. You\a146ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\a146s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\a148He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\a147You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \a145Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\a148\a147You forget that I know nothing about it.\a148\a147I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\a146s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\a146t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\a146ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\a148\a147Proceed, then.\a148\a147Some years ago\a151 to be definite, in May, 1884\a151 there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\a147Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\a146s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\a148\a147It is very clear.\a148\a147If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\a147Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\a151 for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night\a151 and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\a146s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\a147This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\a151 all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\a147And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\a146s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\a146s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\a146s clothes.\a147So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\a148\a147But a cripple!\a148 said I. \a147What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\a148\a147He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\a148\a147Pray continue your narrative.\a148\a147Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\a146s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\a147And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\a146s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\a148\a147I cannot imagine.\a148\a147No, I don\a146t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\a151421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\a148\a147But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\a148\a147No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\a146s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\a148\a147It certainly sounds feasible.\a148\a147Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\a151 what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance\a151 are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\a148While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\a147We are on the outskirts of Lee,\a148 said my companion. \a147We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\a146s feet.\a148\a147But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\a148 I asked.\a147Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\a148We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\a146s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light \imousseline de soie\i, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\a147Well?\a148 she cried, \a147well?\a148 And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\a147No good news?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147No bad?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\a148\a147This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\a148\a147I am delighted to see you,\a148 said she, pressing my hand warmly. \a147You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\a148\a147My dear madam,\a148 said I, \a147I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\a148\a147Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \a147I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\a148\a147Certainly, madam.\a148\a147Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\a148\a147Upon what point?\a148\a147In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\a148Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \a147Frankly, now!\a148 she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\a147Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\a148\a147You think that he is dead?\a148\a147I do.\a148\a147Murdered?\a148\a147I don\a146t say that. Perhaps.\a148\a147And on what day did he meet his death?\a148\a147On Monday.\a148\a147Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\a148Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\a147What!\a148 he roared.\a147Yes, to-day.\a148 She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\a147May I see it?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\a147Coarse writing,\a148 murmured Holmes. \a147Surely this is not your husband\a146s writing, madam.\a148\a147No, but the enclosure is.\a148\a147I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\a148\a147How can you tell that?\a148\a147The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\a148\a147Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\a148\a147And you are sure that this is your husband\a146s hand?\a148\a147One of his hands.\a148\a147One?\a148\a147His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\a148\a147\a160\a145Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.\a151 NEVILLE.\a146 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\a146s hand, madam?\a148\a147None. Neville wrote those words.\a148\a147And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\a148\a147But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\a148\a147No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\a148\a147Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\a148\a147That is possible.\a148\a147If so, much may have happened between.\a148\a147Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\a148\a147I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\a148\a147I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\a148\a147And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\a148\a147Very much so.\a148\a147Was the window open?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Then he might have called to you?\a148\a147He might.\a148\a147He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147A call for help, you thought?\a148\a147Yes. He waved his hands.\a148\a147But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\a148\a147It is possible.\a148\a147And you thought he was pulled back?\a148\a147He disappeared so suddenly.\a148\a147He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\a148\a147No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\a148\a147Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\a148\a147But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\a148\a147Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\a148A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\a147Awake, Watson?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes.\a148\a147Game for a morning drive?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\a148 He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\a147I want to test a little theory of mine,\a148 said he, pulling on his boots. \a147I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\a148\a147And where is it?\a148 I asked, smiling.\a147In the bathroom,\a148 he answered. \a147Oh, yes, I am not joking,\a148 he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \a147I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\a148We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\a147It has been in some points a singular case,\a148 said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \a147I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\a148In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\a146s head while the other led us in.\a147Who is on duty?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\a148\a147Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\a148 A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \a147I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\a148 \a147Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\a148 It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\a147What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I called about that beggarman, Boone\a151 the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\a148\a147Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\a148\a147So I heard. You have him here?\a148\a147In the cells.\a148\a147Is he quiet?\a148\a147Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\a148\a147Dirty?\a148\a147Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\a146s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\a148\a147I should like to see him very much.\a148\a147Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\a148\a147No, I think that I\a146ll take it.\a148\a147Very good. Come this way, if you please.\a148 He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\a147The third on the right is his,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Here it is!\a148 He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\a147He is asleep,\a148 said he. \a147You can see him very well.\a148We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\a147He\a146s a beauty, isn\a146t he?\a148 said the inspector.\a147He certainly needs a wash,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\a148 He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\a147He! he! You are a funny one,\a148 chuckled the inspector.\a147Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t know why not,\a148 said the inspector. \a147He doesn\a146t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\a148 He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\a146s face.\a147Let me introduce you,\a148 he shouted, \a147to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\a148Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\a146s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\a147Great heavens!\a148 cried the inspector, \a147it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\a148The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \a147Be it so,\a148 said he. \a147And pray what am I charged with?\a148\a147With making away with Mr. Neville St.\a151 Oh, come, you can\a146t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\a148 said the inspector with a grin. \a147Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\a148\a147If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\a148\a147No crime, but a very great error has been committed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You would have done better to have trusted you wife.\a148\a147It was not the wife; it was the children,\a148 groaned the prisoner. \a147God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\a148Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\a147If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\a148 said he, \a147of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\a148\a147God bless you!\a148 cried the prisoner passionately. \a147I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\a147You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\a147I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit\a146s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\a146s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\a147Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\a147Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds a year\a151 which is less than my average takings\a151 but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\a147As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\a147Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\a146s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\a147I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\a148\a147That note only reached her yesterday,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Good God! What a week she must have spent!\a148\a147The police have watched this Lascar,\a148 said Inspector Bradstreet, \a147and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\a148\a147That was it,\a148 said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \a147I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\a148\a147Many times; but what was a fine to me?\a148\a147It must stop here, however,\a148 said Bradstreet. \a147If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\a148\a147I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\a148\a147In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\a148\a147I reached this one,\a148 said my friend, \a147by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\a148\BAdventure VII\B - \X1\BThe Blue Carbuncle\B\X1\c\i\m="blue-04.png"\i\cI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\a147You are engaged,\a148 said I; \a147perhaps I interrupt you.\a148\a147Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\a148\a151 he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat\a151\a147but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\a148I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \a147I suppose,\a148 I remarked, \a147that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\a151 that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\a148\a147No, no. No crime,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \a147Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\a148\a147So much so,\a148 I remarked, \a147that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\a148\a147Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147It is to him that this trophy belongs.\a148\a147It is his hat.\a148\a147No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\a146s fire. The facts are these: about four o\a146clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\a146s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\a148\a147Which surely he restored to their owner?\a148\a147My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \a145For Mrs. Henry Baker\a146 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\a146s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \a145H. B.\a146 are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\a148\a147What, then, did Peterson do?\a148\a147He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\a148\a147Did he not advertise?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\a148\a147Only as much as we can deduce.\a148\a147From his hat?\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\a148\a147Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\a148I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\a146s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \a147H. B.\a148 were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\a147I can see nothing,\a148 said I, handing it back to my friend.\a147On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\a148\a147Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\a148He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \a147It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\a148 he remarked, \a147and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\a148 he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \a147He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\a148\a147You are certainly joking, Holmes.\a148\a147Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\a148\a147I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\a148For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \a147It is a question of cubic capacity,\a148 said he; \a147a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\a148\a147The decline of his fortunes, then?\a148\a147This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\a148\a147Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\a148Sherlock Holmes laughed. \a147Here is the foresight,\a148 said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \a147They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\a148\a147Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\a148\a147The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\a148\a147But his wife\a151 you said that she had ceased to love him.\a148\a147This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\a146s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\a146s affection.\a148\a147But he might be a bachelor.\a148\a147Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\a146s leg.\a148\a147You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\a148\a147One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow\a151 walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\a148\a147Well, it is very ingenious,\a148 said I, laughing; \a147but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\a148Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\a147The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\a148 he gasped.\a147Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\a148 Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\a146s excited face.\a147See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\a148 He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \a147By Jove, Peterson!\a148 said he, \a147this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\a148\a147A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\a148\a147It\a146s more than a precious stone. It is \ithe\i precious stone.\a148\a147Not the Countess of Morcar\a146s blue carbuncle?\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in \iThe Times\i every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\a148\a147A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\a148 The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\a147That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\a148\a147It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\a148 I remarked.\a147Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\a146s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\a148 He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\a147Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\a146s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\a148\a147Hum! So much for the police-court,\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \a147The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\a148\a147What will you say?\a148\a147Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \a145Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\a146 That is clear and concise.\a148\a147Very. But will he see it?\a148\a147Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\a148\a147In which, sir?\a148\a147Oh, in the \iGlobe\i, \iStar\i, \iPall Mall\i, \iSt. James\a146s Gazette\i, \iEvening News\i, \iStandard\i, \iEcho\i, and any others that occur to you.\a148\a147Very well, sir. And this stone?\a148\a147Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\a148When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \a147It\a146s a bonny thing,\a148 said he. \a147Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\a146s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\a146ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\a148\a147Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\a148\a147I cannot tell.\a148\a147Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\a148\a147It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\a148\a147And you can do nothing until then?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\a148\a147Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\a148I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\a146 room.\a147Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,\a148 said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \a147Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\a148\a147Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\a148He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\a146 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\a147We have retained these things for some days,\a148 said Holmes, \a147because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\a148Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \a147Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\a148 he remarked. \a147I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\a148\a147Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\a148\a147To eat it!\a148 Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\a147Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\a148\a147Oh, certainly, certainly,\a148 answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\a147Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish\a151\a148The man burst into a hearty laugh. \a147They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\a148 said he, \a147but beyond that I can hardly see what use the \idisjecta membra\i of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\a148Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\a147There is your hat, then, and there your bird,\a148 said he. \a147By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\a148\a147Certainly, sir,\a148 said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \a147There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum\a151 we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\a148 With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\a147So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\a148 said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \a147It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\a148\a147Not particularly.\a148\a147Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\a148\a147By all means.\a148It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\a146 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\a147Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\a148 said he.\a147My geese!\a148 The man seemed surprised.\a147Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\a148\a147Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\a146s not our geese.\a148\a147Indeed! Whose, then?\a148\a147Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\a148\a147Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\a148\a147Breckinridge is his name.\a148\a147Ah! I don\a146t know him. Well, here\a146s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\a148\a147Now for Mr. Breckinridge,\a148 he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \a147Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\a146 penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\a148We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\a147Good-evening. It\a146s a cold night,\a148 said Holmes.The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\a147Sold out of geese, I see,\a148 continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\a147Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\a148\a147That\a146s no good.\a148\a147Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\a148\a147Ah, but I was recommended to you.\a148\a147Who by?\a148\a147The landlord of the Alpha.\a148\a147Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\a148\a147Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\a148To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\a147Now, then, mister,\a148 said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \a147what are you driving at? Let\a146s have it straight, now.\a148\a147It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\a148\a147Well then, I shan\a146t tell you. So now!\a148\a147Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\a146t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\a148\a147Warm! You\a146d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\a146s \a145Where are the geese?\a146 and \a145Who did you sell the geese to?\a146 and \a145What will you take for the geese?\a146 One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\a148\a147Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\a148 said Holmes carelessly. \a147If you won\a146t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\a146m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\a148\a147Well, then, you\a146ve lost your fiver, for it\a146s town bred,\a148 snapped the salesman.\a147It\a146s nothing of the kind.\a148\a147I say it is.\a148\a147I don\a146t believe it.\a148\a147D\a146you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\a148\a147You\a146ll never persuade me to believe that.\a148\a147Will you bet, then?\a148\a147It\a146s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\a146ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\a148The salesman chuckled grimly. \a147Bring me the books, Bill,\a148 said he.The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\a147Now then, Mr. Cocksure,\a148 said the salesman, \a147I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\a146ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147That\a146s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\a146you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\a148\a147Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\a151249,\a148 read Holmes.\a147Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\a148Holmes turned to the page indicated. \a147Here you are, \a145Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\a146\a160\a148\a147Now, then, what\a146s the last entry?\a148\a147\a160\a145December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\a146\a160\a148\a147Quite so. There you are. And underneath?\a148\a147\a160\a145Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\a146\a160\a148\a147What have you to say now?\a148Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\a147When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \i\a145Pink \a145un\a146\i protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\a148 said he. \a147I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\a151\a148His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\a147I\a146ve had enough of you and your geese,\a148 he shouted. \a147I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\a146ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\a146ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\a148\a147No; but one of them was mine all the same,\a148 whined the little man.\a147Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\a148\a147She told me to ask you.\a148\a147Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\a146ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\a148 He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\a147Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\a148 whispered Holmes. \a147Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\a148 Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\a147Who are you, then? What do you want?\a148 he asked in a quavering voice.\a147You will excuse me,\a148 said Holmes blandly, \a147but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\a148\a147You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\a148\a147My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\a146t know.\a148\a147But you can know nothing of this?\a148\a147Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\a148\a147Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\a148 cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \a147I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\a148Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \a147In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\a148 said he. \a147But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\a148The man hesitated for an instant. \a147My name is John Robinson,\a148 he answered with a sidelong glance.\a147No, no; the real name,\a148 said Holmes sweetly. \a147It is always awkward doing business with an \ialias\i.\a148A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \a147Well then,\a148 said he, \a147my real name is James Ryder.\a148\a147Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\a148The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\a147Here we are!\a148 said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \a147The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested\a151 white, with a black bar across the tail.\a148Ryder quivered with emotion. \a147Oh, sir,\a148 he cried, \a147can you tell me where it went to?\a148\a147It came here.\a148\a147Here?\a148\a147Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\a146t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\a151 the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\a148Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\a147The game\a146s up, Ryder,\a148 said Holmes quietly. \a147Hold up, man, or you\a146ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\a146s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\a148For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\a147I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\a146s?\a148\a147It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\a148 said he in a crackling voice.\a147I see\a151 her ladyship\a146s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\a146s room\a151 you and your confederate Cusack\a151 and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then\a151\a148Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\a146s knees. \a147For God\a146s sake, have mercy!\a148 he shrieked. \a147Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\a146ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\a146t bring it into court! For Christ\a146s sake, don\a146t!\a148\a147Get back into your chair!\a148 said Holmes sternly. \a147It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\a148\a147I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\a148\a147Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\a148Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \a147I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\a148 said he. \a147When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\a146s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\a147I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\a147My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds\a151 a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\a147\a160\a145Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\a146 says she.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said I, \a145you said you\a146d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh,\a146 says she, \a145we\a146ve set yours aside for you\a151 Jem\a146s bird, we call it. It\a146s the big white one over yonder. There\a146s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\a146\a147\a160\a145Thank you, Maggie,\a146 says I; \a145but if it is all the same to you, I\a146d rather have that one I was handling just now.\a146\a147\a160\a145The other is a good three pound heavier,\a146 said she, \a145and we fattened it expressly for you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Never mind. I\a146ll have the other, and I\a146ll take it now,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Oh, just as you like,\a146 said she, a little huffed. \a145Which is it you want, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\a146\a147Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\a146s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\a147\a160\a145Where are they all, Maggie?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Gone to the dealer\a146s, Jem.\a146\a147\a160\a145Which dealer\a146s?\a146\a147\a160\a145Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\a146\a147\a160\a145But was there another with a barred tail?\a146 I asked, \a145the same as the one I chose?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\a146\a147Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\a151 and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\a148 He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\a146 finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\a147Get out!\a148 said he.\a147What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\a148\a147No more words. Get out!\a148And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\a147After all, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \a147I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\a148\p\BAdventure VIII\B - \X1\BThe Speckled Band\B\X1\c\i\m="spec-08.png"\i\cOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.It was early in April in the year \a14683 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\a147Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147but it\a146s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\a148\a147What is it, then\a151 a fire?\a148\a147No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\a148\a147My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\a148I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\a147Good-morning, madam,\a148 said Holmes cheerily. \a147My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\a148\a147It is not cold which makes me shiver,\a148 said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\a147What, then?\a148\a147It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\a148 She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\a147You must not fear,\a148 said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \a147We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\a148\a147You know me, then?\a148\a147No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\a148The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\a147There is no mystery, my dear madam,\a148 said he, smiling. \a147The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\a148\a147Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\a148 said she. \a147I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\a151 none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\a148Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\a147Farintosh,\a148 said he. \a147Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\a148\a147Alas!\a148 replied our visitor, \a147the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\a148\a147I am all attention, madam.\a148\a147My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\a148Holmes nodded his head. \a147The name is familiar to me,\a148 said he.\a147The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\a147When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\a146s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\a151 not less than 1000 pounds a year\a151 and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died\a151 she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\a147But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\a146s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\a147Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\a147You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\a148\a147Your sister is dead, then?\a148\a147She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\a146s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\a146s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\a148Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\a147Pray be precise as to details,\a148 said he.\a147It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\a146s, the second my sister\a146s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\a148\a147Perfectly so.\a148\a147The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\a146clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\a147\a160\a145Tell me, Helen,\a146 said she, \a145have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\a146\a147\a160\a145Never,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly not. But why?\a146\a147\a160\a145Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\a151 perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\a146 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\a148\a147Indeed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\a148\a147Always.\a148\a147And why?\a148\a147I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\a148\a147Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\a148\a147I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\a146s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\a146s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \a145Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\a146 There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\a146s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\a146s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 said Holmes, \a147are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\a148\a147That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\a148\a147Was your sister dressed?\a148\a147No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\a148\a147Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\a148\a147He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\a146s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\a148\a147How about poison?\a148\a147The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\a148\a147What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\a148\a147It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\a148\a147Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\a148\a147Yes, there are nearly always some there.\a148\a147Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\a151 a speckled band?\a148\a147Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\a148Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\a147These are very deep waters,\a148 said he; \a147pray go on with your narrative.\a148\a147Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage\a151 Percy Armitage\a151 the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\a148\a147You have done wisely,\a148 said my friend. \a147But have you told me all?\a148\a147Yes, all.\a148\a147Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\a148\a147Why, what do you mean?\a148For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\a146s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\a147You have been cruelly used,\a148 said Holmes.The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \a147He is a hard man,\a148 she said, \a147and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\a148There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\a147This is a very deep business,\a148 he said at last. \a147There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\a148\a147As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\a148\a147Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\a148\a147I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\a146clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\a148 \a147And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\a148\a147No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\a148 She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\a147And what do you think of it all, Watson?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\a147It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\a148\a147Dark enough and sinister enough.\a148\a147Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\a148\a147What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\a148\a147I cannot think.\a148\a147When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\a146s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\a148\a147But what, then, did the gipsies do?\a148\a147I cannot imagine.\a148\a147I see many objections to any such theory.\a148\a147And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\a148The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\a147Which of you is Holmes?\a148 asked this apparition.\a147My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\a148 said my companion quietly.\a147I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\a148\a147Indeed, Doctor,\a148 said Holmes blandly. \a147Pray take a seat.\a148\a147I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\a148\a147It is a little cold for the time of the year,\a148 said Holmes.\a147What has she been saying to you?\a148 screamed the old man furiously.\a147But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\a148 continued my companion imperturbably.\a147Ha! You put me off, do you?\a148 said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \a147I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\a148My friend smiled.\a147Holmes, the busybody!\a148His smile broadened.\a147Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\a148Holmes chuckled heartily. \a147Your conversation is most entertaining,\a148 said he. \a147When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\a148\a147I will go when I have said my say. Don\a146t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\a148 He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\a147See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\a148 he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\a147He seems a very amiable person,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\a148 As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\a147Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\a146 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\a148It was nearly one o\a146clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\a147I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\a148 said he. \a147To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\a146s death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\a146s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\a146s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\a148At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\a147Look there!\a148 said he.A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\a147Stoke Moran?\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\a148 remarked the driver.\a147There is some building going on there,\a148 said Holmes; \a147that is where we are going.\a148\a147There\a146s the village,\a148 said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \a147but if you want to get to the house, you\a146ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\a148\a147And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\a148 observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \a147Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\a148We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\a147I thought it as well,\a148 said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \a147that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\a148Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \a147I have been waiting so eagerly for you,\a148 she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \a147All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\a148\a147We have had the pleasure of making the doctor\a146s acquaintance,\a148 said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\a147Good heavens!\a148 she cried, \a147he has followed me, then.\a148\a147So it appears.\a148\a147He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\a148\a147He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\a146s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\a148The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\a147This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\a146s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\a146s chamber?\a148\a147Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\a148\a147Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\a148\a147There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\a148\a147Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\a148\a147Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\a148\a147As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\a148Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \a147Hum!\a148 said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \a147my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\a148A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\a147Where does that bell communicate with?\a148 he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\a147It goes to the housekeeper\a146s room.\a148\a147It looks newer than the other things?\a148\a147Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\a148\a147Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\a148\a147No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\a148\a147Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\a148 He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\a147Why, it\a146s a dummy,\a148 said he.\a147Won\a146t it ring?\a148\a147No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\a148\a147How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\a148\a147Very strange!\a148 muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \a147There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\a148\a147That is also quite modern,\a148 said the lady.\a147Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\a148\a147They seem to have been of a most interesting character\a151 dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\a148Dr. Grimesby Roylott\a146s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\a147What\a146s in here?\a148 he asked, tapping the safe.\a147My stepfather\a146s business papers.\a148\a147Oh! you have seen inside, then?\a148\a147Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\a148\a147There isn\a146t a cat in it, for example?\a148\a147No. What a strange idea!\a148\a147Well, look at this!\a148 He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\a147No; we don\a146t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\a148\a147Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\a148 He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\a147Thank you. That is quite settled,\a148 said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \a147Hullo! Here is something interesting!\a148The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\a147What do you make of that, Watson?\a148\a147It\a146s a common enough lash. But I don\a146t know why it should be tied.\a148\a147That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\a146s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\a148I had never seen my friend\a146s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\a147It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\a148 said he, \a147that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\a148\a147I shall most certainly do so.\a148\a147The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\a148\a147I assure you that I am in your hands.\a148\a147In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\a148Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\a147Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\a148\a147Yes, that is the Crown.\a148\a147Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\a148\a147Oh, yes, easily.\a148\a147The rest you will leave in our hands.\a148\a147But what will you do?\a148\a147We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\a148\a147I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\a148 said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\a146s sleeve.\a147Perhaps I have.\a148\a147Then, for pity\a146s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\a146s death.\a148\a147I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\a148\a147You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\a148\a147No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\a148Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\a146s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \a147I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\a148\a147Can I be of assistance?\a148\a147Your presence might be invaluable.\a148\a147Then I shall certainly come.\a148\a147It is very kind of you.\a148\a147You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\a148\a147No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\a148\a147I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\a148\a147You saw the ventilator, too?\a148\a147Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\a148\a147I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\a146s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\a146s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\a148\a147But what harm can there be in that?\a148\a147Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\a148\a147I cannot as yet see any connection.\a148\a147Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\a148\a147I cannot say that I have.\a148\a147The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope\a151 or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\a148\a147Holmes,\a148 I cried, \a147I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\a148\a147Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\a146 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\a148About nine o\a146clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\a147That is our signal,\a148 said Holmes, springing to his feet; \a147it comes from the middle window.\a148As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\a147My God!\a148 I whispered; \a147did you see it?\a148Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\a147It is a nice household,\a148 he murmured. \a147That is the baboon.\a148I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\a146 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\a147The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\a148I nodded to show that I had heard.\a147We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\a148I nodded again.\a147Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\a148I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\a151 a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\a147You see it, Watson?\a148 he yelled. \a147You see it?\a148But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\a147What can it mean?\a148 I gasped.\a147It means that it is all over,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\a146s room.\a148With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\a147The band! the speckled band!\a148 whispered Holmes.I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\a147It is a swamp adder!\a148 cried Holmes; \a147the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\a148As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\a146s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\a146s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\a146s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\a147I had,\a148 said he, \a147come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \a145band,\a146 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\a147I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\a148\a147With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\a148\a147And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\a146s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\a148\p\BAdventure IX\B - \X1\BThe Engineer\a146s Thumb\B\X1\c\i\m="engr-06.png"\i\cOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\a151 that of Mr. Hatherley\a146s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\a146s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth \ien bloc\i in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.It was in the summer of \a14689, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.One morning, at a little before seven o\a146clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\a147I\a146ve got him here,\a148 he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \a147he\a146s all right.\a148\a147What is it, then?\a148 I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\a147It\a146s a new patient,\a148 he whispered. \a147I thought I\a146d bring him round myself; then he couldn\a146t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\a148 And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\a147I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\a148 said he, \a147but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\a148I took it up and glanced at it. \a147Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\a148 That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \a147I regret that I have kept you waiting,\a148 said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \a147You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\a148\a147Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,\a148 said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\a147Stop it!\a148 I cried; \a147pull yourself together!\a148 and I poured out some water from a caraffe.It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\a147I have been making a fool of myself,\a148 he gasped.\a147Not at all. Drink this.\a148 I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\a147That\a146s better!\a148 said he. \a147And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\a148He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried, \a147this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\a148\a147Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\a148\a147Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.\a148\a147It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\a148\a147This has been done,\a148 said I, examining the wound, \a147by a very heavy and sharp instrument.\a148\a147A thing like a cleaver,\a148 said he.\a147An accident, I presume?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147What! a murderous attack?\a148\a147Very murderous indeed.\a148\a147You horrify me.\a148I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\a147How is that?\a148 I asked when I had finished.\a147Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\a148\a147Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\a148\a147Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\a148\a147Ha!\a148 cried I, \a147if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\a148\a147Oh, I have heard of that fellow,\a148 answered my visitor, \a147and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\a148\a147I\a146ll do better. I\a146ll take you round to him myself.\a148\a147I should be immensely obliged to you.\a148\a147We\a146ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\a148\a147Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\a148\a147Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\a148 I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of \iThe Times\i and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\a147It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\a148 said he. \a147Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said my patient. \a147but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\a148Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\a147You must know,\a148 said he, \a147that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\a146s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\a147I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\a147Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \a145Colonel Lysander Stark\a146 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Hatherley?\a146 said he, with something of a German accent. \a145You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\a146\a147I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \a145May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\a146\a147\a160\a145That is quite correct,\a146 I answered; \a145but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\a146\a147\a160\a145Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but \iabsolute\i secrecy is quite essential\a151 absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\a146\a147\a160\a145If I promise to keep a secret,\a146 said I, \a145you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\a146\a147He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\a147\a160\a145Do you promise, then?\a146 said he at last.\a147\a160\a145Yes, I promise.\a146\a147\a160\a145Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have already given you my word.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very good.\a146 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\a147\a160\a145That\a146s all right,\a146 said he, coming back. \a145I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\a146s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\a146 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\a147A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\a147\a160\a145I beg that you will state your business, sir,\a146 said I; \a145my time is of value.\a146 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\a147\a160\a145How would fifty guineas for a night\a146s work suit you?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Most admirably.\a146\a147\a160\a145I say a night\a146s work, but an hour\a146s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\a146\a147\a160\a145The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\a146\a147\a160\a145Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where to?\a146\a147\a160\a145To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very good.\a146\a147\a160\a145I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\a146\a147\a160\a145There is a drive, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\a146\a147\a160\a145That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\a146\a147\a160\a145We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\a146\a147I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \a145Not at all,\a146 said I, \a145I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\a146\a147\a160\a145Entirely.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\a146s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have heard so.\a146\a147\a160\a145Some little time ago I bought a small place\a151 a very small place\a151 within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\a146s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left\a151 both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\a146\a147\a160\a145I quite follow you,\a146 said I. \a145The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\a146s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah!\a146 said he carelessly, \a145we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\a146 He rose as he spoke. \a145I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\a146\a147\a160\a145I shall certainly be there.\a146\a147\a160\a145And not a word to a soul.\a146 He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\a147Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\a146s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\a147At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\a146clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\a148\a147One horse?\a148 interjected Holmes.\a147Yes, only one.\a148\a147Did you observe the colour?\a148\a147Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\a148\a147Tired-looking or fresh?\a148\a147Oh, fresh and glossy.\a148\a147Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\a148\a147Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\a147It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\a147\a160\a145Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\a146 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \a145I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\a146 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\a147I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\a147Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\a147\a160\a145I would go,\a146 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \a145I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145But, madam,\a146 said I, \a145I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is not worth your while to wait,\a146 she went on. \a145You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\a146 And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \a145For the love of Heaven!\a146 she whispered, \a145get away from here before it is too late!\a146\a147But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\a147The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\a147\a160\a145This is my secretary and manager,\a146 said the colonel. \a145By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\a146\a147\a160\a145On the contrary,\a146 said I, \a145I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\a146\a147He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \a145Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\a146 said he. \a145Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\a146\a147\a160\a145I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, no, it is in the house.\a146\a147\a160\a145What, you dig fuller\a146s-earth in the house?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\a146\a147We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\a147Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\a147\a160\a145We are now,\a146 said he, \a145actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\a146\a147I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\a146s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\a147\a160\a145What are you doing there?\a146 he asked.\a147I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \a145I was admiring your fuller\a146s-earth,\a146 said I; \a145I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\a146\a147The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\a147\a160\a145Very well,\a146 said he, \a145you shall know all about the machine.\a146 He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \a145Hullo!\a146 I yelled. \a145Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\a146\a147And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\a147I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\a147I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\a147\a160\a145Come! come!\a146 she cried breathlessly. \a145They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\a146\a147This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\a146s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\a147\a160\a145It is your only chance,\a146 said she. \a145It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\a146\a147As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\a146s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\a147\a160\a145Fritz! Fritz!\a146 she cried in English, \a145remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\a146\a147\a160\a145You are mad, Elise!\a146 he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \a145You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\a146 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\a147I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\a147How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\a146s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\a147Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\a147It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\a148We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\a147Here is an advertisement which will interest you,\a148 said he. \a147It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \a145Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\a146clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\a146 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 cried my patient. \a147Then that explains what the girl said.\a148\a147Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\a148Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\a147There you are,\a148 said he. \a147That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\a148\a147It was an hour\a146s good drive.\a148\a147And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\a148\a147They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\a148\a147What I cannot understand,\a148 said I, \a147is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\a146s entreaties.\a148\a147I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\a148\a147Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,\a148 said Bradstreet. \a147Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\a148\a147I think I could lay my finger on it,\a148 said Holmes quietly.\a147Really, now!\a148 cried the inspector, \a147you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\a148\a147And I say east,\a148 said my patient.\a147I am for west,\a148 remarked the plain-clothes man. \a147There are several quiet little villages up there.\a148\a147And I am for north,\a148 said I, \a147because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\a148\a147Come,\a148 cried the inspector, laughing; \a147it\a146s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\a148\a147You are all wrong.\a148\a147But we can\a146t \iall\i be.\a148\a147Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.\a148 He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \a147This is where we shall find them.\a148\a147But the twelve-mile drive?\a148 gasped Hatherley.\a147Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\a148\a147Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\a148 observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \a147Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\a148\a147None at all,\a148 said Holmes. \a147They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\a148\a147We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\a148 said the inspector. \a147They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\a148But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\a147A house on fire?\a148 asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\a147Yes, sir!\a148 said the station-master.\a147When did it break out?\a148\a147I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\a148\a147Whose house is it?\a148\a147Dr. Becher\a146s.\a148\a147Tell me,\a148 broke in the engineer, \a147is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\a148The station-master laughed heartily. \a147No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\a146t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\a148The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\a147That\a146s it!\a148 cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \a147There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\a148\a147Well, at least,\a148 said Holmes, \a147you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\a148And Holmes\a146 fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\a146 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\a147Well,\a148 said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \a147it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\a148\a147Experience,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\a148\p\BAdventure X\B - \X1\BThe Noble Bachelor\B\X1\c\i\m="nobl-04.png"\i\cThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\a146s noble correspondent could be.\a147Here is a very fashionable epistle,\a148 I remarked as he entered. \a147Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\a148\a147Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\a148 he answered, smiling, \a147and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\a148He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\a147Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\a148\a147Not social, then?\a148\a147No, distinctly professional.\a148\a147And from a noble client?\a148\a147One of the highest in England.\a148\a147My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\a148\a147I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\a148\a147It looks like it,\a148 said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \a147I have had nothing else to do.\a148\a147It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\a148\a147Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\a148\a147That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\a147\a160\a145MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\a151 Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\a146clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.\a146\a147It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\a148 remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\a147He says four o\a146clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\a148\a147Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\a148 He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \a147Here he is,\a148 said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \a147\a160\a145Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\a146 Hum! \a145Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\a146 He\a146s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\a148\a147I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\a148 said I, \a147for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\a148\a147Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now\a151 though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\a148\a147Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the \iMorning Post\i, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \a145A marriage has been arranged,\a146 it says, \a145and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\a146 That is all.\a148\a147Terse and to the point,\a148 remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\a147There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \a145There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\a146s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\a146\a160\a148\a147Anything else?\a148 asked Holmes, yawning.\a147Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the \iMorning Post\i to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\a146s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later\a151 that is, on Wednesday last\a151 there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\a146s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\a148\a147Before the what?\a148 asked Holmes with a start.\a147The vanishing of the lady.\a148\a147When did she vanish, then?\a148\a147At the wedding breakfast.\a148\a147Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\a148\a147Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\a148\a147They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\a148\a147I warn you that they are very incomplete.\a148\a147Perhaps we may make them less so.\a148\a147Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \a145Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\a146:\a147\a160\a145The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\a147\a160\a145The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\a146s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\a146\a160\a148\a147And is that all?\a148\a147Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\a148\a147And it is\a151\a148\a147That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a \idanseuse\i at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now\a151 so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\a148\a147And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\a148\a147Lord Robert St. Simon,\a148 announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\a147Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\a148 said Holmes, rising and bowing. \a147Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\a148\a147A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\a148\a147No, I am descending.\a148\a147I beg pardon.\a148\a147My last client of the sort was a king.\a148\a147Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\a148\a147The King of Scandinavia.\a148\a147What! Had he lost his wife?\a148\a147You can understand,\a148 said Holmes suavely, \a147that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\a148\a147Of course! Very right! very right! I\a146m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\a148\a147Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\a151 this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\a148Lord St. Simon glanced over it. \a147Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\a148\a147But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\a148\a147Pray do so.\a148\a147When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\a148\a147In San Francisco, a year ago.\a148\a147You were travelling in the States?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Did you become engaged then?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147But you were on a friendly footing?\a148\a147I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\a148\a147Her father is very rich?\a148\a147He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\a148\a147And how did he make his money?\a148\a147In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\a148\a147Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady\a146s\a151 your wife\a146s character?\a148The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \a147You see, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\a151 volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\a148\a151 he gave a little stately cough\a151\a147had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\a148\a147Have you her photograph?\a148\a147I brought this with me.\a148 He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\a147The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\a148\a147Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\a148\a147She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\a148\a147A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\a148\a147And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\a148\a147I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\a148\a147Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Was she in good spirits?\a148\a147Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\a148\a147Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\a148\a147She was as bright as possible\a151 at least until after the ceremony.\a148\a147And did you observe any change in her then?\a148\a147Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\a148\a147Pray let us have it, for all that.\a148\a147Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\a146s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\a148\a147Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\a148\a147Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\a148\a147This gentleman was not one of your wife\a146s friends?\a148\a147No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\a148\a147Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\a146s house?\a148\a147I saw her in conversation with her maid.\a148\a147And who is her maid?\a148\a147Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\a148\a147A confidential servant?\a148\a147A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\a148\a147How long did she speak to this Alice?\a148\a147Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\a148\a147You did not overhear what they said?\a148\a147Lady St. Simon said something about \a145jumping a claim.\a146 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\a148\a147American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\a148\a147She walked into the breakfast-room.\a148\a147On your arm?\a148\a147No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\a148\a147But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\a146s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\a148\a147Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\a146s house that morning.\a148\a147Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\a148Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \a147We have been on a friendly footing for some years\a151 I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\a146s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\a148\a147Did your wife hear all this?\a148\a147No, thank goodness, she did not.\a148\a147And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\a148\a147Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\a148\a147Well, it is a possible supposition.\a148\a147You think so, too?\a148\a147I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\a148\a147I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\a148\a147Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\a148\a147Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\a148\a147In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\a148\a147Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\a151 I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success\a151 I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\a148\a147Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\a148\a147We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\a148\a147Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\a148\a147Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\a148 said our client, rising.\a147I have solved it.\a148\a147Eh? What was that?\a148\a147I say that I have solved it.\a148\a147Where, then, is my wife?\a148\a147That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\a148Lord St. Simon shook his head. \a147I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\a148 he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\a147It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \a147I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\a146s example.\a148\a147But I have heard all that you have heard.\a148\a147Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\a151 but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\a148The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\a147What\a146s up, then?\a148 asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \a147You look dissatisfied.\a148\a147And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\a148\a147Really! You surprise me.\a148\a147Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\a148\a147And very wet it seems to have made you,\a148 said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\a147Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\a148\a147In heaven\a146s name, what for?\a148\a147In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\a148Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\a147Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\a148 he asked.\a147Why? What do you mean?\a148\a147Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\a148Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \a147I suppose you know all about it,\a148 he snarled.\a147Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\a148\a147Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\a148\a147I think it very unlikely.\a148\a147Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\a148 He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\a146s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \a147There,\a148 said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \a147There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\a148\a147Oh, indeed!\a148 said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \a147You dragged them from the Serpentine?\a148\a147No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\a148\a147By the same brilliant reasoning, every man\a146s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\a148\a147At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\a148\a147I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\a148\a147Are you, indeed, now?\a148 cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \a147I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\a148\a147And how?\a148\a147In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\a148 He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \a147Listen to this: \a145You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.\a146 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\a148\a147Very good, Lestrade,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\a148 He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \a147This is indeed important,\a148 said he.\a147Ha! you find it so?\a148\a147Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\a148Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \a147Why,\a148 he shrieked, \a147you\a146re looking at the wrong side!\a148\a147On the contrary, this is the right side.\a148\a147The right side? You\a146re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\a148\a147And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\a148\a147There\a146s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147\a160\a145Oct. 4th, rooms 8\is\i., breakfast 2\is\i. 6\id\i., cocktail 1\is\i., lunch 2\is\i. 6\id\i., glass sherry, 8\id\i.\a146 I see nothing in that.\a148\a147Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\a148\a147I\a146ve wasted time enough,\a148 said Lestrade, rising. \a147I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\a148 He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\a147Just one hint to you, Lestrade,\a148 drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \a147I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\a148Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \a147There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\a148 he remarked, \a147so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\a148It was after five o\a146clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\a146s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a \ipat\a233 de foie gras\i pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.Just before nine o\a146clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\a147They have laid the supper, then,\a148 he said, rubbing his hands.\a147You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\a148\a147Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\a148 said he. \a147I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\a148It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\a147My messenger reached you, then?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\a148\a147The best possible.\a148Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\a147What will the Duke say,\a148 he murmured, \a147when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\a148\a147It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\a148\a147Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\a148\a147I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\a148\a147It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\a148 said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\a147You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\a148\a147I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\a148\a147I think that I heard a ring,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\a148 He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \a147Lord St. Simon,\a148 said he \a147allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\a148At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\a147You\a146re angry, Robert,\a148 said she. \a147Well, I guess you have every cause to be.\a148\a147Pray make no apology to me,\a148 said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\a147Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\a146t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\a146t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\a148\a147Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\a148\a147If I may give an opinion,\a148 remarked the strange gentleman, \a147we\a146ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\a148 He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\a147Then I\a146ll tell our story right away,\a148 said the lady. \a147Frank here and I met in \a14684, in McQuire\a146s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn\a146t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \a146Frisco. Frank wouldn\a146t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \a145Why shouldn\a146t we be married right away, then,\a146 said he, \a145and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\a146t claim to be your husband until I come back?\a146 Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\a147The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\a146 camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\a146s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \a146Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \a146Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\a147Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\a146d have done my duty by him. We can\a146t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\a146t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\a146t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\a147When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\a146t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me\a151 seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also\a151 but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \a146Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\a148\a147I saw it in a paper,\a148 explained the American. \a147It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\a148\a147Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again\a151 just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\a148Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\a147Excuse me,\a148 he said, \a147but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\a148\a147Then you won\a146t forgive me? You won\a146t shake hands before I go?\a148\a147Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\a148 He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\a147I had hoped,\a148 suggested Holmes, \a147that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\a148\a147I think that there you ask a little too much,\a148 responded his Lordship. \a147I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\a148 He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\a147Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\a148\a147The case has been an interesting one,\a148 remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \a147because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\a148\a147You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\a148\a147From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\a146s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\a146s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\a151 which in miners\a146 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to\a151 the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband\a151 the chances being in favour of the latter.\a148\a147And how in the world did you find them?\a148\a147It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\a148\a147How did you deduce the select?\a148\a147By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\a148\a147But with no very good result,\a148 I remarked. \a147His conduct was certainly not very gracious.\a148\a147Ah, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, smiling, \a147perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\a148\p\BAdventure XI\B - \X1\BThe Beryl Coronet\B\X1\c\i\m="BERY-09.png"\i\c\a147Holmes,\a148 said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \a147here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\a148My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\a147What on earth can be the matter with him?\a148 I asked. \a147He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\a148\a147I believe that he is coming here,\a148 said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\a147Here?\a148\a147Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\a148 As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\a147You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\a148 said he. \a147You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\a148The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\a147No doubt you think me mad?\a148 said he.\a147I see that you have had some great trouble,\a148 responded Holmes.\a147God knows I have!\a151 a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\a148\a147Pray compose yourself, sir,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\a148\a147My name,\a148 answered our visitor, \a147is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\a148The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\a147I feel that time is of value,\a148 said he; \a147that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\a147It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\a147Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\a151 well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\a151 one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Holder,\a146 said he, \a145I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\a146\a147\a160\a145The firm does so when the security is good.\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145It is absolutely essential to me,\a146 said he, \a145that I should have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\a146s self under obligations.\a146\a147\a160\a145For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\a146 said I, \a145were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should much prefer to have it so,\a146 said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \a145You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\a146\a147\a160\a145One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Precisely.\a146 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \a145There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\a146 said he, \a145and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\a146\a147I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\a147\a160\a145You doubt its value?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Not at all. I only doubt\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\a146\a147\a160\a145Ample.\a146\a147\a160\a145You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\a146\a147Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\a147When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\a146 safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\a147And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\a147So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\a151 a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\a147It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\a147And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\a146s quick insight into character.\a147And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house\a151 sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\a151 forever too late!\a147Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\a147When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\a147\a160\a145Where have you put it?\a146 asked Arthur.\a147\a160\a145In my own bureau.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, I hope to goodness the house won\a146t be burgled during the night.\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145It is locked up,\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\a146\a147He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\a147\a160\a145Look here, dad,\a146 said he with his eyes cast down, \a145can you let me have 200 pounds?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I cannot!\a146 I answered sharply. \a145I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have been very kind,\a146 said he, \a145but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\a146\a147\a160\a145And a very good thing, too!\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\a146 said he. \a145I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\a146\a147I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \a145You shall not have a farthing from me,\a146 I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\a147When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure\a151 a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\a147\a160\a145Tell me, dad,\a146 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \a145did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly not.\a146\a147\a160\a145She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\a146\a147\a160\a145You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite sure, dad.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then, good-night.\a146 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\a147I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\a148\a147On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\a148\a147I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\a147\a160\a145Arthur!\a146 I screamed, \a145you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\a146\a147The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\a147\a160\a145You blackguard!\a146 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \a145You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\a146\a147\a160\a145Stolen!\a146 he cried.\a147\a160\a145Yes, thief!\a146 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\a147\a160\a145There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\a146\a147\a160\a145You have called me names enough,\a146 said he, \a145I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\a146 I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \a145I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall learn nothing from me,\a146 said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \a145If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\a146\a147By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\a146s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\a147\a160\a145At least,\a146 said he, \a145you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\a146\a147\a160\a145That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\a146 said I. And then, realizing the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\a147\a160\a145You may as well face the matter,\a146 said I; \a145you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\a146\a147\a160\a145Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\a146 he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\a148He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\a147Do you receive much company?\a148 he asked.\a147None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\a146s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\a148\a147Do you go out much in society?\a148\a147Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\a148\a147That is unusual in a young girl.\a148\a147She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\a148\a147This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\a148\a147Terrible! She is even more affected than I.\a148\a147You have neither of you any doubt as to your son\a146s guilt?\a148\a147How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\a148\a147I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\a148\a147Yes, it was twisted.\a148\a147Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\a148\a147God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\a148\a147Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\a148\a147They considered that it might be caused by Arthur\a146s closing his bedroom door.\a148\a147A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\a148\a147They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\a148\a147Have they thought of looking outside the house?\a148\a147Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\a148\a147Now, my dear sir,\a148 said Holmes. \a147is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\a148\a147But what other is there?\a148 cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \a147If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\a148\a147It is our task to find that out,\a148 replied Holmes; \a147so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\a148My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\a146s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\a146 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\a146s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\a146s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\a146s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\a147You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\a148 she asked.\a147No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\a148\a147But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\a146s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\a148\a147Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\a148\a147Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\a148\a147How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\a148\a147Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\a148\a147I shall never let it drop until the gems are found\a151 never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\a148\a147This gentleman?\a148 she asked, facing round to me.\a147No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\a148\a147The stable lane?\a148 She raised her dark eyebrows. \a147What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\a148\a147I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\a148 returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \a147I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\a148\a147Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\a148\a147You heard nothing yourself last night?\a148\a147Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\a148\a147You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Were they all fastened this morning?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\a148\a147Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\a146s remarks about the coronet.\a148\a147I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\a148\a147But what is the good of all these vague theories,\a148 cried the banker impatiently, \a147when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\a148\a147Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\a148\a147Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\a148\a147Do you know him?\a148\a147Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\a148\a147He stood,\a148 said Holmes, \a147to the left of the door\a151 that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\a148\a147Yes, he did.\a148\a147And he is a man with a wooden leg?\a148Something like fear sprang up in the young lady\a146s expressive black eyes. \a147Why, you are like a magician,\a148 said she. \a147How do you know that?\a148 She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\a146 thin, eager face.\a147I should be very glad now to go upstairs,\a148 said he. \a147I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\a148He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \a147Now we shall go upstairs,\a148 said he at last.The banker\a146s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\a147Which key was used to open it?\a148 he asked.\a147That which my son himself indicated\a151 that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\a148\a147Have you it here?\a148\a147That is it on the dressing-table.\a148Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\a147It is a noiseless lock,\a148 said he. \a147It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\a148 He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\a146s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\a147Now, Mr. Holder,\a148 said Holmes, \a147here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\a148The banker recoiled in horror. \a147I should not dream of trying,\a148 said he.\a147Then I will.\a148 Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \a147I feel it give a little,\a148 said he; \a147but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\a148\a147I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\a148\a147But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\a148\a147I confess that I still share my uncle\a146s perplexity.\a148\a147Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\a148\a147He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\a148\a147Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\a148He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\a147I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\a148 said he; \a147I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\a148\a147But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\a148\a147I cannot tell.\a148The banker wrung his hands. \a147I shall never see them again!\a148 he cried. \a147And my son? You give me hopes?\a148\a147My opinion is in no way altered.\a148\a147Then, for God\a146s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\a148\a147If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me \icarte blanche\i to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\a148\a147I would give my fortune to have them back.\a148\a147Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\a148It was obvious to me that my companion\a146s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\a147I think that this should do,\a148 said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \a147I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\a146t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\a146-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\a148 He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\a147I only looked in as I passed,\a148 said he. \a147I am going right on.\a148\a147Where to?\a148\a147Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\a146t wait up for me in case I should be late.\a148\a147How are you getting on?\a148\a147Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\a148I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\a147You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\a148\a147Why, it is after nine now,\a148 I answered. \a147I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\a148It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\a147I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\a148 said he. \a147Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\a148\a147Deserted you?\a148\a147Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\a147\a160\a145MY DEAREST UNCLE:\a151 I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\a151 MARY.\a146\a147What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\a148\a147No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\a148\a147Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\a148\a147You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?\a148\a147I would pay ten.\a148\a147That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.\a148With a dazed face the banker made out the required cheque. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\a147You have it!\a148 he gasped. \a147I am saved! I am saved!\a148The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\a147There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\a147Owe!\a148 He caught up a pen. \a147Name the sum, and I will pay it.\a148\a147No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\a148\a147Then it was not Arthur who took them?\a148\a147I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\a148\a147You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\a148\a147He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\a148\a147For heaven\a146s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\a148\a147I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\a148\a147My Mary? Impossible!\a148\a147It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\a151 a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\a148\a147I cannot, and I will not, believe it!\a148 cried the banker with an ashen face.\a147I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\a146 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\a147Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\a147As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\a148\a147Is it possible?\a148 gasped the banker.\a147You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\a148\a147And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\a148 cried Mr. Holder. \a147Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\a148\a147When I arrived at the house,\a148 continued Holmes, \a147I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\a146s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\a147There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\a147On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\a147It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\a151 the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\a147And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\a147Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\a146s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\a148\a147I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\a148 said Mr. Holder.\a147Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held\a1511000 pounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \a145Why, dash it all!\a146 said he, \a145I\a146ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\a146 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\a146clock, after what I may call a really hard day\a146s work.\a148\a147A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\a148 said the banker, rising. \a147Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\a148\a147I think that we may safely say,\a148 returned Holmes, \a147that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\a148\p\BAdventure XII\B - \X1\BThe Copper Beeches\B\X1\c\i\m="copp-06.png"\i\c\a147To the man who loves art for its own sake,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the \iDaily Telegraph\i, \a147it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many \icauses c\a200l\a203bres\i and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\a148\a147And yet,\a148 said I, smiling, \a147I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\a148\a147You have erred, perhaps,\a148 he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood\a151\a147you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\a148\a147It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\a148 I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\a146s singular character.\a147No, it is not selfishness or conceit,\a148 said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \a147If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\a151 a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\a148It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\a147At the same time,\a148 he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \a147you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\a148\a147The end may have been so,\a148 I answered, \a147but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\a148\a147Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\a148 He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\a147DEAR MR. HOLMES:\a151 I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfullyVIOLET HUNTER.\a148\a147Do you know the young lady?\a148 I asked.\a147Not I.\a148\a147It is half-past ten now.\a148\a147Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\a148\a147It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\a148\a147Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\a148As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\a146s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\a147You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\a148 said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \a147but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\a148\a147Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\a148I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\a147I have been a governess for five years,\a148 said she, \a147in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\a146s end as to what I should do.\a147There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\a146s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\a147Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\a147\a160\a145That will do,\a146 said he; \a145I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\a146 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\a147\a160\a145You are looking for a situation, miss?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir.\a146\a147\a160\a145As governess?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir.\a146\a147\a160\a145And what salary do you ask?\a146\a147\a160\a145I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, tut, tut! sweating\a151 rank sweating!\a146 he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \a145How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\a146\a147\a160\a145My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\a146 said I. \a145A little French, a little German, music, and drawing\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145Tut, tut!\a146 he cried. \a145This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.\a146\a147You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\a147\a160\a145It is also my custom,\a146 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \a145to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\a146\a147It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\a147\a160\a145May I ask where you live, sir?\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\a146\a147\a160\a145And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\a146\a147\a160\a145One child\a151 one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\a146 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\a147I was a little startled at the nature of the child\a146s amusement, but the father\a146s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\a147\a160\a145My sole duties, then,\a146 I asked, \a145are to take charge of a single child?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\a146 he cried. \a145Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\a146\a147\a160\a145I should be happy to make myself useful.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know\a151 faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\a146\a147\a160\a145No,\a146 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\a147\a160\a145Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, no.\a146\a147\a160\a145Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\a146\a147I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\a147\a160\a145I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\a146 said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\a147\a160\a145I am afraid that it is quite essential,\a146 said he. \a145It is a little fancy of my wife\a146s, and ladies\a146 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\a146 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\a146t cut your hair?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, sir, I really could not,\a146 I answered firmly.\a147\a160\a145Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\a146\a147The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\a147\a160\a145Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\a146 she asked.\a147\a160\a145If you please, Miss Stoper.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\a146 said she sharply. \a145You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\a146 She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\a147The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. DEAR MISS HUNTER: Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\a148\a147That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\a148\a147Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\a148 said Holmes, smiling.\a147But you would not advise me to refuse?\a148\a147I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\a148\a147What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\a148\a147Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\a148\a147That is a possible solution\a151 in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\a148\a147But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\a148\a147Well, yes, of course the pay is good\a151 too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some strong reason behind.\a148\a147I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\a148\a147Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\a151\a148\a147Danger! What danger do you foresee?\a148Holmes shook his head gravely. \a147It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\a148 said he. \a147But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\a148\a147That is enough.\a148 She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \a147I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\a148 With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\a147At least,\a148 said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \a147she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\a148\a147And she would need to be,\a148 said Holmes gravely. \a147I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\a148It was not very long before my friend\a146s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \a147Data! data! data!\a148 he cried impatiently. \a147I can\a146t make bricks without clay.\a148 And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\a147Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\a148 said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.The summons was a brief and urgent one.\a147Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\a148 it said. \a147Do come! I am at my wit\a146s end. HUNTER.\a148\a147Will you come with me?\a148 asked Holmes, glancing up.\a147I should wish to.\a148\a147Just look it up, then.\a148\a147There is a train at half-past nine,\a148 said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \a147It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\a148\a147That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\a148By eleven o\a146clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\a146s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\a147Are they not fresh and beautiful?\a148 I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.But Holmes shook his head gravely.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried. \a147Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\a148\a147They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\a148\a147You horrify me!\a148\a147But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\a146s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\a148\a147No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\a148\a147Quite so. She has her freedom.\a148\a147What \ican\i be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\a148\a147I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\a148The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\a147I am so delighted that you have come,\a148 she said earnestly. \a147It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\a148\a147Pray tell us what has happened to you.\a148\a147I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\a148\a147Let us have everything in its due order.\a148 Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\a147In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\a148\a147What can you not understand?\a148\a147Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\a146s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\a147I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\a146s young wife.\a147Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\a148\a147I am glad of all details,\a148 remarked my friend, \a147whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\a148\a147I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\a147For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\a147\a160\a145Oh, yes,\a146 said he, turning to me, \a145we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\a146\a147The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\a147Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense \ir\a200pertoire\i, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\a147You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\a147\a160\a145Jephro,\a146 said she, \a145there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\a146\a147\a160\a145No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145No, I know no one in these parts.\a146\a147\a160\a145Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\a146\a147\a160\a145Surely it would be better to take no notice.\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\a146\a147I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\a148\a147Pray continue,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\a148\a147You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\a147\a160\a145Look in here!\a146 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \a145Is he not a beauty?\a146\a147I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\a147\a160\a145Don\a146t be frightened,\a146 said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \a145It\a146s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\a146 sake don\a146t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\a146s as much as your life is worth.\a146\a147The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\a146clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\a147And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\a147I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How \icould\i my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\a147I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\a147This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\a147\a160\a145Ah!\a146 said he, \a145you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\a146\a147I assured him that I was not offended. \a145By the way,\a146 said I, \a145you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\a146\a147He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\a147\a160\a145Photography is one of my hobbies,\a146 said he. \a145I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\a146 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\a151 a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\a146s instinct; perhaps it was woman\a146s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\a147It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\a147There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran\a151 ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\a147\a160\a145So,\a146 said he, smiling, \a145it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, I am so frightened!\a146 I panted.\a147\a160\a145My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\a146\a151 you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\a151\a145and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\a146\a147But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\a147\a160\a145I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\a146 I answered. \a145But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\a146\a147\a160\a145Only that?\a146 said he, looking at me keenly.\a147\a160\a145Why, what did you think?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Why do you think that I lock this door?\a146\a147\a160\a145I am sure that I do not know.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\a146 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\a147\a160\a145I am sure if I had known\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\a146\a151 here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\a151\a145I\a146ll throw you to the mastiff.\a146\a147I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\a146clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\a148Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\a147Is Toller still drunk?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\a148\a147That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\a148\a147Yes, the wine-cellar.\a148\a147You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\a148\a147I will try. What is it?\a148\a147We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\a146clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\a148\a147I will do it.\a148\a147Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers\a151 possibly her fianc\a200\a151 and no doubt, as you wore the girl\a146s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\a148\a147What on earth has that to do with it?\a148 I ejaculated.\a147My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\a146t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\a146s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\a146s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\a148\a147I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\a148 cried our client. \a147A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\a148\a147We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\a146clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\a148We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\a147Have you managed it?\a148 asked Holmes.A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \a147That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\a148 said she. \a147Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\a146s.\a148\a147You have done well indeed!\a148 cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \a147Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\a148We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\a146 face clouded over.\a147I trust that we are not too late,\a148 said he. \a147I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\a148It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\a147There has been some villainy here,\a148 said Holmes; \a147this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\a146s intentions and has carried his victim off.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\a148 He swung himself up onto the roof. \a147Ah, yes,\a148 he cried, \a147here\a146s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\a148\a147But it is impossible,\a148 said Miss Hunter; \a147the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\a148\a147He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\a148The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\a147You villain!\a148 said he, \a147where\a146s your daughter?\a148The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\a147It is for me to ask you that,\a148 he shrieked, \a147you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\a146ll serve you!\a148 He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\a147He\a146s gone for the dog!\a148 cried Miss Hunter.\a147I have my revolver,\a148 said I.\a147Better close the front door,\a148 cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\a147My God!\a148 he cried. \a147Someone has loosed the dog. It\a146s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\a146ll be too late!\a148Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\a146s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\a147Mrs. Toller!\a148 cried Miss Hunter.\a147Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\a146t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\a148\a147Ha!\a148 said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \a147It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\a148\a147Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\a148\a147Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\a148\a147I will soon make it clear to you,\a148 said she; \a147and I\a146d have done so before now if I could ha\a146 got out from the cellar. If there\a146s police-court business over this, you\a146ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\a146s friend too.\a147She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\a146t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\a146s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\a146s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\a146t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\a146s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\a146t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\a148\a147Ah,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\a148\a147That was it, sir.\a148\a147But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\a148\a147Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\a148 said Mrs. Toller serenely.\a147And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\a148\a147You have it, sir, just as it happened.\a148\a147I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\a148 said Holmes, \a147for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our \ilocus standi\i now is rather a questionable one.\a148And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\a146s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\p\c\l\B\X0The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\c\p\X1\lSilver Blaze\B\X1\c\i\m="silv-02.png"\i\c\a147I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,\a148 said Holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning.\a147Go! Where to?\a148\a147To Dartmoor; to King\a146s Pyland.\a148I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed upon this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what I had both expected and hoped for.\a147I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the way,\a148 said I.\a147My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.\a148And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the corner of a first-class carriage flying along \ien route\i for Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.\a147We are going well,\a148 said he, looking out the window and glancing at his watch. \a147Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.\a148\a147I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,\a148 said I.\a147Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?\a148\a147I have seen what the \iTelegraph\i and the \iChronicle\i have to say.\a148\a147It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such personal importance to so many people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact\a151 of absolute undeniable fact\a151 from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my cooperation.\a147Tuesday evening!\a148 I exclaimed. \a147And this is Thursday morning. Why didn\a146t you go down yesterday?\a148\a147Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson\a151 which is, I am afraid, a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe is possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.\a148\a147You have formed a theory, then?\a148\a147At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we start.\a148I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our journey.\a147Silver Blaze,\a148 said he, \a147is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday.\a147The fact was, of course, appreciated at King\a146s Pyland, where the Colonel\a146s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey who rode in Colonel Ross\a146s colours before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.\a147On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o\a146clock. Two of the lads walked up to the trainer\a146s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path ran across the open moor.\a147Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a gray suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it.\a147\a160\a145Can you tell me where I am?\a146 he asked. \a145I had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.\a146\a147\a160\a145You are close to the King\a146s Pyland training-stables,\a146 said she.\a147\a160\a145Oh, indeed. What a stroke of luck!\a146 he cried. \a145I understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?\a148 He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. \a145See that the boy has this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.\a146\a147She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.\a147\a160\a145Good-evening,\a146 said he, looking through the window. \a145I wanted to have a word with you\a148. The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.\a147\a160\a145What business have you here?\a146 asked the lad.\a147\a160\a145It\a146s business that may put something into your pocket,\a146 said the other. \a145You\a146ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup\a151 Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won\a146t be a loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?\a146\a147\a160\a145So, you\a146re one of those damned touts!\a146 cried the lad. \a145I\a146ll show you how we serve them in King\a146s Pyland\a148. He sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 I asked. \a147Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?\a148\a147Excellent, Watson, excellent!\a148 murmured my companion. \a147The importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.\a147Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.\a147Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite\a146s stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.\a147The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy.\a147About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker\a146s overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognized by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables. Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman. As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill effect.\a147Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what the police have done in the matter. \a147Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favourite. On being arrested he volunteered that statement that he had come down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the King\a146s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed. On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of Straker\a146s knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.\a148I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to each other.\a147Is it not possible,\a148 I suggested, \a147that the incised wound upon Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?\a148\a147It is more than possible; it is probable,\a148 said Holmes. \a147In that case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.\a148\a147And yet,\a148 said I, \a147even now I fail to understand what the theory of the police can be.\a148\a147I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it,\a148 returned my companion. \a147The police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued. Simpson beat out the trainer\a146s brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than our present position.\a148It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the station\a151 the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.\a147I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said the Colonel. \a147The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.\a148\a147Have there been any fresh developments?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,\a148 said the Inspector. \a147We have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.\a148A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.\a147The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,\a148 he remarked, \a147and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same time I recognize that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.\a148\a147How about Straker\a146s knife?\a148\a147We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.\a148\a147My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.\a148\a147Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man\a146s hand. I really think we have enough to go before a jury.\a148Holmes shook his head. \a147A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,\a148 said he. \a147Why should he take the horse out of the stable. If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there. Has a duplicate key been found in his possession. What chemist sold him the powdered opium. Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this. What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?\a148\a147He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away. The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.\a148\a147What does he say about the cravat?\a148\a147He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable.\a148Holmes pricked up his ears.\a147We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?\a148\a147It is certainly possible.\a148\a147The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.\a148\a147There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?\a148\a147Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.\a148\a147And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the Mapleton stables?\a148\a147Nothing at all.\a148Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased. A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road. Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long gray-tiled out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.\a147Excuse me,\a148 said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him in some surprise. \a147I was day-dreaming\a148. There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.\a147Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?\a148 said Gregory.\a147I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?\a148\a147Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.\a148\a147He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?\a148\a147I have always found him an excellent servant.\a148\a147I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in this pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?\a148\a147I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care to see them.\a148\a147I should be very glad\a148. We all filed into the front room and sat round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P brier-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very delicate, inflexible bade marked Weiss & Co., London.\a147This is a very singular knife,\a148 said Holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely. \a147I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one which was found in the dead man\a146s grasp. Watson, this knife is surely in your line?\a148\a147It is what we call a cataract knife,\a148 said I.\a147I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.\a148\a147The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,\a148 said the Inspector. \a147His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment.\a148\a147Very possible. How about these papers?\a148\a147Three of them are receipted hay-dealers\a146 accounts. One of them is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner\a146s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs. Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband\a146s and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.\a148\a147Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,\a148 remarked Holmes, glancing down the account. \a147Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.\a148As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector\a146s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager, stamped with the print of a recent horror.\a147Have you got them. Have you found them?\a148 she panted.\a147No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to help us, and we shall do all that is possible.\a148\a147Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time ago, Mrs. Straker?\a148 said Holmes.\a147No, sir; you are mistaken.\a148\a147Dear me. Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.\a148\a147I never had such a dress, sir,\a148 answered the lady.\a147Ah, that quite settles it,\a148 said Holmes. And with an apology he followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.\a147There was no wind that night, I understand,\a148 said Holmes.\a147None; but very heavy rain.\a148\a147In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush, but placed there.\a148\a147Yes, it was laid across the bush.\a148\a147You fill me with interest. I perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since Monday night.\a148\a147A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all stood upon that.\a148\a147Excellent.\a148\a147In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson\a146s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.\a148\a147My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!. Homes took the bag, and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him. \a147Hullo!\a148 said he, suddenly. \a147What\a146s this?\a148 It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.\a147I cannot think how I came to overlook it,\a148 said the Inspector, with an expression of annoyance.\a147It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was looking for it.\a148\a147What! You expected to find it?\a148\a147I thought it not unlikely.\a148He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and bushes.\a147I am afraid that there are no more tracks,\a148 said the Inspector. \a147I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148 said Holmes, rising. \a147I should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.\a148Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion\a146s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. \a147I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,\a148 said he. \a147There are several points on which I should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse\a146s name from the entries for the Cup.\a148\a147Certainly not,\a148 cried Holmes, with decision. \a147I should let the name stand.\a148The Colonel bowed. \a147I am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,\a148 said he. \a147You will find us at poor Straker\a146s house when you have finished your walk, and we can drive together into Tavistock.\a148He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought.\a147It\a146s this way, Watson,\a148 said he at last. \a147We may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to. The horse is a very gregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to King\a146s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild upon the moor. He would surely have been seen by now. And why should gypsies kidnap him. These people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is clear.\a148\a147Where is he, then?\a148\a147I have already said that he must have gone to King\a146s Pyland or to Mapleton. He is not at King\a146s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But if falls away towards Mapleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.\a148We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes\a146 request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.\a147See the value of imagination,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It is the one quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let us proceed.\a148We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face. A man\a146s track was visible beside the horse\a146s.\a147The horse was alone before,\a148 I cried.\a147Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?\a148The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King\a146s Pyland. Homes whistled, and we both followed along after it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.\a147One for you, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, when I pointed it out. \a147You have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on our own traces. Let us follow the return track.\a148We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a groom ran out from them.\a147We don\a146t want any loiterers about here,\a148 said he.\a147I only wished to ask a question,\a148 said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. \a147Should I be too early to see your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o\a146clock to-morrow morning?\a148\a147Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.\a148As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.\a147What\a146s this, Dawson!\a148 he cried. \a147No gossiping. Go about your business. And you, what the devil do you want here?\a148\a147Ten minutes\a146 talk with you, my good sir,\a148 said Holmes in the sweetest of voices.\a147I\a146ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no stranger here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.\a148Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer\a146s ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.\a147It\a146s a lie!\a148 he shouted, \a147an infernal lie!\a148\a147Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your parlour?\a148\a147Oh, come in if you wish to.\a148Holmes smiled. \a147I shall not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.\a148It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into grays before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion\a146s side like a dog with its master.\a147You instructions will be done. It shall all be done,\a148 said he.\a147There must be no mistake,\a148 said Holmes, looking round at him. The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.\a147Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it first or not?\a148Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. \a147No, don\a146t,\a148 said he; \a147I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or\a151\a148\a147Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!\a148\a147Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow\a148. He turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to him, and we set off for King\a146s Pyland.\a147A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,\a148 remarked Holmes as we trudged along together.\a147He has the horse, then?\a148\a147He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his astonishment at recognizing, from the white forehead which has given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to King\a146s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.\a148\a147But his stables had been searched?\a148\a147Oh, and old horse-fakir like him has many a dodge.\a148\a147But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has every interest in injuring it?\a148\a147My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.\a148\a147Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy in any case.\a148\a147The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the advantage of being unofficial. I don\a146t know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel\a146s manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.\a148\a147Certainly not without your permission.\a148\a147And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the question of who killed John Straker.\a148\a147And you will devote yourself to that?\a148\a147On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.\a148I was thunderstruck by my friend\a146s words. We had only been a few hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at the trainer\a146s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting us in the parlour.\a147My friend and I return to town by the night-express,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful Dartmoor air.\a148The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel\a146s lip curled in a sneer.\a147So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,\a148 said he.Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \a147There are certainly grave difficulties in the way,\a148 said he. \a147I have every hope, however, that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?\a148The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.\a147My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the maid.\a148\a147I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London consultant,\a148 said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room. \a147I do not see that we are any further than when he came.\a148\a147At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,\a148 said I.\a147Yes, I have his assurance,\a148 said the Colonel, with a shrug of his shoulders. \a147I should prefer to have the horse.\a148I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he entered the room again.\a147Now, gentlemen,\a148 said he, \a147I am quite ready for Tavistock.\a148As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.\a147You have a few sheep in the paddock,\a148 he said. \a147Who attends to them?\a148\a147I do, sir.\a148\a147Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?\a148\a147Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.\a148I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together.\a147A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,\a148 said he, pinching my arm. \a147Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!\a148Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion which he had formed of my companion\a146s ability, but I saw by the Inspector\a146s face that his attention had been keenly aroused.\a147You consider that to be important?\a148 he asked.\a147Exceedingly so.\a148\a147Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\a148\a147To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\a148\a147The dog did nothing in the night-time.\a148\a147That was the curious incident,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes.Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme.\a147I have seen nothing of my horse,\a148 said he.\a147I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?\a148 asked Holmes.The Colonel was very angry. \a147I have been on the turf for twenty years, and never was asked such a question as that before,\a148 said he. \a147A child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.\a148\a147How is the betting?\a148\a147Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can hardly get three to one now.\a148\a147Hum!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Somebody knows something, that is clear.\a148As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I glanced at the card to see the entries.Wessex Plate [it ran] 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and five year olds. Second, \a163300. Third, \a163200. New course (one mile and five furlongs). Mr. Heath Newton\a146s The Negro. Red cap. Cinnamon jacket. Colonel Wardlaw\a146s Pugilist. Pink cap. Blue and black jacket. Lord Backwater\a146s Desborough. Yellow cap and sleeves. Colonel Ross\a146s Silver Blaze. Black cap. Red jacket. Duke of Balmoral\a146s Iris. Yellow and black stripes. Lord Singleford\a146s Rasper. Purple cap. Black sleeves.\a147We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,\a148 said the Colonel. \a147Why, what is that. Silver Blaze favourite?\a148\a147Five to four against Silver Blaze!\a148 roared the ring. \a147Five to four against Silver Blaze. Five to fifteen against Desborough. Five to four on the field!\a148\a147There are the numbers up,\a148 I cried. \a147They are all six there.\a148\a147All six there. Then my horse is running,\a148 cried the Colonel in great agitation. \a147But I don\a146t see him. My colours have not passed.\a148\a147Only five have passed. This must be he.\a148As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighting enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on it back the well-known black and red of the Colonel.\a147That\a146s not my horse,\a148 cried the owner. \a147That beast has not a white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, well, let us see how he gets on,\a148 said my friend, imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. \a147Capital. An excellent start!\a148 he cried suddenly. \a147There they are, coming round the curve!\a148From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front. Before they reached us, however, Desborough\a146s bolt was shot, and the Colonel\a146s horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of Balmoral\a146s Iris making a bad third.\a147It\a146s my race, anyhow,\a148 gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his eyes. \a147I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it. Don\a146t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,\a148 he continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where only owners and their friends find admittance. \a147You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.\a148\a147You take my breath away!\a148\a147I found him in the hands of a fakir, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over.\a148\a147My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker.\a148\a147I have done so,\a148 said Holmes quietly.The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. \a147You have got him. Where is he, then?\a148\a147He is here.\a148\a147Here. Where?\a148\a147In my company at the present moment.\a148The Colonel flushed angrily. \a147I quite recognize that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147but I must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.\a148Sherlock Holmes laughed. \a147I assure you that I have not associated you with the crime, Colonel,\a148 said he. \a147The real murderer is standing immediately behind you\a148. He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.\a147The horse!\a148 cried both the Colonel and myself.\a147Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.\a148We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion\a146s narrative of the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.\a147I confess,\a148 said he, \a147that any theories which I had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer\a146s house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.\a148\a147I confess,\a148 said the Colonel, \a147that even now I cannot see how it helps us.\a148\a147It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer\a146s family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them?\a147Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one whom the dog knew well.\a147I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For what purpose. For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable-boy. And yet I was at a loss to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. What was it here. I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.\a147And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man\a146s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse\a146s ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.\a148\a147Villain. Scoundrel!\a148 cried the Colonel.\a147We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.\a148\a147I have been blind!\a148 cried the Colonel. \a147Of course that was why he needed the candle, and struck the match.\a148\a147Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people\a146s bills about in their pockets. We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner\a146s address, and felt that by calling there with Straker\a146s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical Derbyshire.\a147From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up\a151 with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse\a146s leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 cried the Colonel. \a147Wonderful. You might have been there!\a148\a147My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice on. My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.\a147When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had recognized Straker as an excellent customer of the name of Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this miserable plot.\a148\a147You have explained all but one thing,\a148 cried the Colonel. \a147Where was the horse?\a148\a147Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which might interest you.\a148\p\X1\BThe Cardboard Box\B\X1\c\i\m="card-03.png"\i\cIn choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice, has provided him with. With this short preface I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly terrible, chain of events.It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. But the morning paper was uninteresting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the country.Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion\a146s voice broke in upon my thoughts:\a147You are right, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It does seem a most preposterous way of settling a dispute.\a148\a147Most preposterous!\a148 I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement.\a147What is this, Holmes?\a148 I cried. \a147This is beyond anything which I could have imagined.\a148He laughed heartily at my perplexity.\a147You remember,\a148 said he, \a147that some little time ago when I read you the passage in one of Poe\a146s sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere \itour-de-force\i of the author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.\a148\a147Oh, no!\a148\a147Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.\a148But I was still far from satisfied. \a147In the example which you read to me,\a148 said I, \a147the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?\a148\a147You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful servants.\a148\a147Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features?\a148\a147Your features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced?\a148\a147No, I cannot.\a148\a147Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon\a146s picture over there.\a148\a147You have followed me wonderfully!\a148 I exclaimed.\a147So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher\a146s career. I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.\a148\a147Absolutely!\a148 said I. \a147And now that you have explained it, I confess that I am as amazed as before.\a148\a147It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day. But I have in my hands here a little problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street Croydon?\a148\a147No, I saw nothing.\a148\a147Ah! then you must have overlooked it. Just toss it over to me. Here it is, under the financial column. Perhaps you would be good enough to read it aloud.\a148I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the paragraph indicated. It was headed, \a147A Gruesome Packet.\a148 -\a147Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to the incident. At two o\a146clock yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before. There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing\a146s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\a148-\a147So much for the \iDaily Chronicle\i,\a148 said Holmes as I finished reading. \a147Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this morning, in which he says:-\a147I think that this case is very much in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day. -What say you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\a148\a147I was longing for something to do.\a148\a147You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to order a cab. I\a146ll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.\a148A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim, with whitened stone steps, and little groups of aproned women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her.\a147They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,\a148 said she as Lestrade entered. I wish that you would take them away altogether.\a148\a147So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend, Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.\a148\a147Why in my presence, sir?\a148\a147In case he wished to ask any questions.\a148\a147What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know nothing whatever about it?\a148\a147Quite so, madam,\a148 said Holmes in his soothing way. \a147I have no doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business.\a148\a147Indeed, I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the police in my house. I won\a146t have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse.\a148It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined, one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.\a147The string is exceedingly interesting,\a148 he remarked, holding it up to the light and sniffing at it. \a147What do you make of this string, Lestrade?\a148\a147It has been tarred.\a148\a147Precisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You have also, no doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. This is of importance.\a148\a147I cannot see the importance,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that this knot is of a peculiar character.\a148\a147It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that effect\a148 said Lestrade complacently.\a147So much for the string, then,\a148 said Holmes, smiling, \a147now for the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: \a145Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.\a146 Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J and with very inferior ink. The word \a145Croydon\a146 has been originally spelled with an \a145i,\a146 which has been changed to \a145y.\a146 The parcel was directed, then, by a man\a151 the printing is distinctly masculine\a151 of limited education and unacquainted with the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular enclosures.\a148He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion. Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation.\a147You have observed, of course,\a148 said he at last, \a147that the ears are not a pair.\a148\a147Yes, I have noticed that. But if this were the practical joke of some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to send two odd ears as a pair.\a147Precisely. But this is not a practical joke.\a148\a147You are sure of it?\a148\a147The presumption is strongly against it. Bodies in the dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. These ears bear no signs of this. They are fresh, too. They have been cut off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt. I repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious crime.\a148A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion\a146s words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is only half convinced.\a147There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt\a148 said he, \a147but there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?\a148\a147That is the problem which we have to solve,\a148 Holmes answered, \a147and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct and that a double murder has been committed. One of these ears is a woman\a146s, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring. The other is a man\a146s, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning. The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or earlier. If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle here which needs straightening out.\a148 He had been talking in a high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.\a147I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\a148 said he.\a147In that case I may leave you here\a148 said Lestrade, \a147for I have another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the police-station.\a148\a147We shall look in on our way to the train,\a148 answered Holmes. A moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.\a147I am convinced, sir,\a148 she said, \a147that this matter is a mistake, and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said this several times to the gentleman from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?\a148\a147I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,\a148 said Holmes, taking a seat beside her. \a147I think that it is more than probable-\a148 he paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady\a146s profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion\a146s evident excitement.\a147There were one or two questions-\a148\a147Oh, I am weary of questions!\a148 cried Miss Cushing impatiently.\a147You have two sisters, I believe.\a148\a147How could you know that?\a148\a147I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the relationship.\a148\a147Yes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.\a148\a147And here at my elbow is another portrait taken at Liverpool, of your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried at the time.\a148\a147You are very quick at observing.\a148\a147That is my trade.\a148\a147Well, you are quite right. But she was married to Mr. Browner a few days afterwards. He was on the South American line when that was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn\a146t abide to leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London boats.\a148\a147Ah, the \iConqueror\i, perhaps?\a148\a147No, the \iMay Day\i, when last I heard. Jim came down here to see me once. That was before he broke the pledge, but afterwards he would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink would send him stark, staring mad. Ah! it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in his hand again. First he dropped me, then he quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we don\a146t know how things are going with them.\a148It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which she felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative. She told us many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with their names and those of their hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in a question from time to time.\a147About your second sister, Sarah,\a148 said he. \a147I wonder, since you are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.\a148\a147Ah! you don\a146t know Sarah\a146s temper or you would wonder no more. I tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two months ago, when we had to part. I don\a146t want to say a word against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to please, was Sarah.\a148\a147You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.\a148\a147Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. Why, she went up there to live in order to be near them. And now she has no word hard enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways. He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that was the start of it.\a148\a147Thank you, Miss Cushing,\a148 said Holmes, rising and bowing. \a147Your sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington? Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you have been troubled over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do.\a148There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.\a147How far to Wallington?\a148 he asked.\a147Only about a mile, sir.\a148\a147Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is hot. Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive details in connection with it. Just pull up at a telegraph office as you pass, cabby.\a148Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his face. Our driver pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which we had just quitted. My companion ordered him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.\a147Is Miss Cushing at home?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,\a148 said he. \a147She has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call again in ten days.\a148 He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off down the street.\a147Well, if we can\a146t we can\a146t,\a148 said Holmes, cheerfully.\a147Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\a148\a147I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-station.\a148We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker\a146s in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.\a147A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he.\a147Ha! It is the answer!\a148 He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it, and crumpled it into his pocket. \a147That\a146s all right\a148 said he.\a147Have you found out anything?\a148\a147I have found out everything!\a148\a147What!\a148 Lestrade stared at him in amazement. \a147You are joking.\a148\a147I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\a148\a147And the criminal?\a148Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards and threw it over to Lestrade.\a147That is the name,\a148 he said. \a147You cannot effect an arrest until to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.\a148 We strode off together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.-\a147The case,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars that night in our rooms at Baker Street, \a147is one where, as in the investigations which you have chronicled under the names of \a145A Study in Scarlet\a146 and of \a145The Sign of Four,\a146 we have been compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. I have written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and, indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at Scotland Yard.\a148\a147Your case is not complete, then?\a148 I asked.\a147It is fairly complete in essentials. We know who the author of the revolting business is, although one of the victims still escapes us. Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.\a148\a147I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool boat, is the man whom you suspect?\a148\a147Oh! it is more than a suspicion.\a148\a147And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\a148\a147On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. Let me run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage. We had formed no theories. We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences from our observations. What did we see first? A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters. It instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for one of these. I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box.\a147The string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our investigation. When I observed that the knot was one which is popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that an the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes.\a147When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was \a145S\a146 it might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether. I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.\a147As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last years \iAnthropological Journal\i you will find two short monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all essentials it was the same ear.\a147Of course I at once saw the enormous importance of the observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation, and probably a very close one. I began to talk to her about her family, and you remember that she at once gave us some exceedingly valuable details.\a147In the first place, her sisters name was Sarah, and her address had until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.\a147And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully. We had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of strong passions\a151 you remember that he threw up what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife\a151 subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a man\a151 presumably a seafaring man\a151 had been murdered at the same time. Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during her residence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats calls at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the \iMay Day\i, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his terrible packet.\a147A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it before going further. An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband. There were many grave objections to this theory, but it was conceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had departed in the \iMay Day\i. Then we went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.\a147I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had been reproduced in her. Then, of course, she might give us very important information, but I was not sanguine that she would. She must have heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the packet was meant. If she had been willing to help justice she would probably have communicated with the police already. However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so we went. We found that the news of the arrival of the packet\a151 for her illness dated from that time\a151 had such an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.\a147However, we were really independent of her help. Our answers were waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed Algar to send them. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs. Browner\a146s house had been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives. It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the \iMay Day\i, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow night. When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in.\a148Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from the detective, and a typewritten document which covered several pages of foolscap.\a147Lestrade has got him all right,\a148 said Holmes, glancing up at me. \a147Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says. -My Dear Holmes:\a147In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our theories\a148 [\a147the \a145we\a146 is rather fine, Watson, is it not?\a148] \a147I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 P.M., and boarded the ss. \iMay Day\i, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company. On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the name of James Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties. On descending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro. He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy\a151 something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair. He jumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the darbies. We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement which was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our shorthand man. We had three copies typewritten, one of which I enclose. The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. With kind regards,\a147Yours very truly,\a147G. LESTRADE.\a147Hum! The investigation really was a very simple one,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147but I don\a146t think it struck him in that light when he first called us in. However, let us see what Jim Browner has to say for himself. This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being verbatim.\a148\a147\a160\a145Have I anything to say? Yes, I have a deal to say. I have to make a clean breast of it all. You can hang me, or you can leave me alone. I don\a146t care a plug which you do. I tell you I\a146ve not shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don\a146t believe I ever will again until I get past all waking. Sometimes it\a146s his face, but most generally it\a146s hers. I\a146m never without one or the other before me. He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind o\a146 surprise upon her face. Ay, the white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.\a147\a160\a145But it was Sarah\a146s fault and may the curse of a broken man put a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! It\a146s not that I want to clear myself. I know that I went back to drink, like the beast that I was. But she would have forgiven me; she would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our door. For Sarah Cushing loved me\a151 that\a146s the root of the business\a151 she loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more of my wife\a146s footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and soul.\a147\a160\a145There were three sisters altogether. The old one was just a good woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just one of ourselves.\a147\a160\a145I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. My God, whoever would have thought that it could have come to this? Whoever would have dreamed it?\a147\a160\a145I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah. She was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a thought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God\a146s mercy.\a147\a160\a145It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never thought anything of that. But one evening my eyes were opened. I had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at home. \a147Where\a146s Mary?\a148 I asked. \a147Oh, she has gone to pay some accounts.\a148 I was impatient and paced up and down the room. \a147Can\a146t you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?\a148 says she. \a147It\a146s a bad compliment to me that you can\a146t be contented with my society for so short a time.\a148 \a147That\a146s all right, my lass,\a148 said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in a fever. I looked into her eyes and I read it all there. There was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. I frowned and drew my hand away. Then she stood by my side in silence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder. \a147Steady old Jim!\a148 said she, and with a kind o\a146 mocking laugh, she run out of the room.\a147Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let her go on biding with us\a151 a besotted fool\a151 but I never said a word to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her. Things went on much as before, but after a time I began to find that there was a bit of a change in Mary herself. She had always been so trusting and so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my letters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand such follies. Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and we had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was fairly puzzled by it all. Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just inseparable. I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and poisoning my wife\a146s mind against me, but I was such a blind beetle that I could not understand it at the time. Then I broke my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not have done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began to be wider and wider. And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in, and things became a thousand times blacker.\a147\a160\a145It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made friends wherever he went. He was a dashing, swaggering chap, smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen. He was good company, I won\a146t deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop than the forecastle. For a month he was in and out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his soft tricky ways. And then at last something made me suspect and from that day my peace was gone forever.\a147\a160\a145It was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlour unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on my wife\a146s face. But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. That was enough for me. There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose. Mary saw the devil\a146s light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. \a147Don\a146t Jim, don\a146t!\a148 says she. \a147Where\a146s Sarah?\a148 I asked. \a147In the kitchen,\a148 says she. \a147Sarah,\a148 says I as I went in, \a147this man Fairbairn is never to darken my door again.\a148 \a147Why not?\a148 says she. \a147Because I order it.\a148 \a147Oh!\a148 says she, \a147if my friends are not good enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.\a148 \a147You can do what you like,\a148 says I, \a147but if Fairbairn shows his face here again I\a146ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.\a148 She was frightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same evening she left my house.\a147\a160\a145Well, I don\a146t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. Anyway, she took a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him. How often she went I don\a146t know, but I followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he was. I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. There was no trace of love between us any longer. I could see that she hated me and feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she despised me as well.\a147\a160\a145Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool, so she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. And then came this last week and all the misery and ruin.\a147\a160\a145It was in this way. We had gone on the \iMay Day\i for a round voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath.\a147\a160\a145I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back on it. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together fairly turned my brain. There\a146s something throbbing in my head now, like a docker\a146s hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in my ears.\a147\a160\a145Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. I had a heavy oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first, but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being seen. They pulled up soon at the railway station. There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without being seen. They took tickets for New Brighton. So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them. When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them. At last I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.\a147It was just as if they had been given into my hands. There was a bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. I could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up. The haze was like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle of it. My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that was closing in upon them? She screamed out. He swore like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death in my eyes. I got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed his head like an egg. I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and calling him \a147Alec.\a148 I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him. I was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should have joined them. I pulled out my knife, and\a151 well, there! I\a146ve said enough. It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such sign of what her meddling had brought about. Then I tied the bodies into the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. I knew very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings and had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of what had passed. That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.\a147\a160\a145There you have the whole truth of it. You can hang me, or do what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished already. I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me\a151 staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze. I killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be either, mad or dead before morning. You won\a146t put me alone into a cell, sir? For pity\a146s sake don\a146t, and may you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.\a148\a147What is the meaning of it Watson?, said Holmes solemnly as he laid down the paper. \a147What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an answer as ever.\a148\p\X1\BThe Yellow Face\B\X1\c\i\m="yell-04.png"\i\cIn publishing these short sketches based upon the numerous cases in which my companion\a146s singular gifts have made us the listeners to, and eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only natural that I should dwell rather upon his successes than upon his failures. And this not so much for the sake of his reputations\a151 for, indeed, it was when he was at his wits\a146 end that his energy and his versatility were most admirable\a151 but because where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left forever without a conclusion. Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered. I have notes of some half-dozen cases of the kind, of which the affair of the second stain, and that which I am about to recount, are the two which present the strongest features of interest.Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise\a146s sake. Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save when there was some professional object to be served. Then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. That he should have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge of austerity. Save for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting.One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk with me in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold leaves. For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately. It was nearly five before we were back in Baker Street once more.\a147Beg pardon, sir,\a148 said our page-boy, as he opened the door. \a147There\a146s been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.\a148Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. \a147So much for afternoon walks!\a148 said he. \a147Has this gentleman gone, then?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Didn\a146t you ask him in?\a148\a147Yes, sir; he came in.\a148\a147How long did he wait?\a148\a147Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin\a146 and a-stampin\a146 all the time he was here. I was waitin\a146 outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage, and he cries, \a145Is that man never goin\a146 to come?\a148 Those were his very words, sir. \a145You\a146ll only need to wait a little longer,\a146 says I. \a145Then I\a146ll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked,\a146 says he. \a145I\a146ll be back before long\a148. And with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn\a146t hold him back.\a148\a147Well, well, you did you best,\a148 said Holmes, as we walked into our room. \a147It\a146s very annoying, though, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man\a146s impatience, as if it were of importance. Hullo! That\a146s not your pipe on the table. He must have left his behind him. A nice old brier with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in London. Some people think that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.\a148\a147How do you know that he values it highly?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence. Now it has, you see, been twice mended, once in the wooden stem and once in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. The man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.\a148\a147Anything else?\a148 I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way.He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger, as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone.\a147Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,\a148 said he. \a147Nothing has more individuality, save perhaps watches and bootlaces. The indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. The owner is obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy.\a148My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.\a147You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe,\a148 said I.\a147This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,\a148 Holmes answered, knocking a little out on his palm. \a147As he might get an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise economy.\a148\a147And the other points?\a148\a147He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. You can see that it is quite charred all down one side. Of course a match could not have done that. Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe. But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred. And it is all on the right side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is a left-handed man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has always been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study.\a148An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room. He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-gray suit, and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him at about thirty, though he was really some years older.\a147I beg your pardon,\a148 said he, with some embarrassment; \a147I suppose I should have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to that\a148. He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.\a147I can see that you have not slept for a night or two,\a148 said Holmes, in his easy, genial way. \a147That tries a man\a146s nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help you?\a148\a147I wanted your advice, sir. I don\a146t know what to do and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces.\a148\a147You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?\a148\a147Not that only. I want your opinion as a judicious man\a151 as a man of the world. I want to know what I ought to do next. I hope to God you\a146ll be able to tell me.\a148He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was overriding his inclinations.\a147It\a146s a very delicate thing,\a148 said he. \a147One does not like to speak of one\a146s domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one\a146s wife with two men whom I have never seen before. It\a146s horrible to have to do it. But I\a146ve got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.\a148\a147My dear Mr. Grant Munro\a151\a148 began Holmes.Our visitor sprang from his char. \a147What!\a148 he cried, \a147you know my mane?\a148\a147If you wish to preserve your \iincognito\i,\a146 said Holmes, smiling, \a147I would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing. I was about to say that my friend and I have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay?\a148Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead, as if he found it bitterly hard. From every gesture and expression I could see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began.\a147The facts are these, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147I am a married man, and have been so for three years. During that time my wife and I have loved each other as fondly and lived as happily as any two that ever were joined. We have not had a difference, not one, in thought or word or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is something in her life and in her thought of which I know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. We are estranged, and I want to know why.\a147Now there is one thing that I want to impress upon you before I go any further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don\a146t let there be any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don\a146t want to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But there\a146s this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.\a148\a147Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,\a148 said Holmes, with some impatience.\a147I\a146ll tell you what I know about Effie\a146s history. She was a widow when I met her first, though quite young\a151 only twenty-five. Her name then was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was young, and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven per cent. She had only been six months at Pinner when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks afterwards.\a147I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.\a147There\a146s one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. When we married, my wife made over all her property to me\a151 rather against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong. However, she would have it so, and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she came to me.\a147\a160\a145Jack,\a146 said she, \a145when you took my money you said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you for it.\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly,\a146 said I. \a145It\a146s all your own.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said she, \a145I want a hundred pounds.\a146\a147I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imagined it was simply a new dress or something of the kind that she was after.\a147\a160\a145What on earth for?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Oh,\a146 said she, in her playful way, \a145you said that you were only my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.\a146\a147\a160\a145If you really mean it, of course you shall have the money,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Oh, yes, I really mean it.\a146\a147\a160\a145And you won\a146t tell me what you want it for?\a146\a147\a160\a145Some day, perhaps, but not just at present, Jack.\a146\a147So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there had ever been any secret between us. I gave her a cheque, and I never thought any more of the matter. It may have nothing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought it only right to mention it.\a147Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house. There is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees are always a neighbourly kinds of things. The cottage had been standing empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would make.\a147Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way, when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.\a147I don\a146t know what there was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right down my back. I was some little way off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the impression that I had, and I moved quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me. But as I did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my impressions. I could not tell if the face were that of a man or a woman. It had been too far from me for that. But its colour was what had impressed me most. It was of a livid chalky white, and with something set and rigid about it which was shockingly unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman with a harsh, forbidding face.\a147\a160\a145What may you be wantin\a146?\a146 she asked, in a Northern accent.\a147\a160\a145I am your neighbour over yonder,\a146 said I, nodding towards my house. \a145I see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any help to you in any\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145Ay, we\a146ll just ask ye when we want ye,\a146 said she, and shut the door in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home. All evening, though I tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman, and I had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply.\a147I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night. And yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before\a151 such as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking which could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning?\a147I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying to find some possible explanation. The more I thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. I was still puzzling over it when I heard the door gently close again, and her footsteps coming up the stairs.\a147\a160\a145Where in the world have you been, Effie?\a146 I asked as she entered.\a147She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when I spoke, and that cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for there was something indescribably guilty about them. My wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her.\a147\a160\a145You awake, Jack!\a146 she cried, with a nervous laugh. \a145Why, I thought that nothing could awake you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where have you been?\a146 I asked, more sternly.\a147\a160\a145I don\a146t wonder that you are surprised,\a146 said she, and I could see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings of her mantle. \a145Why, I never remember having done such a thing in my life before. The fact is that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again.\a146\a147All the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. It was evident to me that she was saying what was false. I said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. What was it that my wife was concealing from me. Where had she been during that strange expedition. I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more unlikely than the last.\a147I should have gone to the City that day, but I was too disturbed in my mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. My wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could see from the little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me that she understood that I disbelieved her statement, and that she was at her wits\a146 end what to do. We hardly exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a walk, that I might think the matter out in the fresh morning air.\a147I went as far as the Crystal Palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back in Norbury by one o\a146clock. It happened that my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to see if I could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. As I stood there, imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out.\a147I was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her; but my emotions were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her face when our eyes met. She seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came forward, with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips.\a147\a160\a145Ah, Jack,\a146 she said, \a145I have just been in to see if I can be of any assistance to our new neighbours. Why do you look at me like that, Jack. You are not angry with me?\a146\a147\a160\a145So,\a146 said I, \a145this is where you went during the night.\a146\a147\a160\a145What do you mean?\a148 she cried.\a147\a160\a145You came here. I am sure of it. Who are these people, that you should visit them at such an hour?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have not been here before.\a146\a147\a160\a145How can you tell me what you know is false?\a146 I cried. \a145Your very voice changes as you speak. When have I ever had a secret from you. I shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom.\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no, Jack, for God\a146s sake!\a146 she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion. Then, as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back with convulsive strength.\a147\a160\a145I implore you not to do this, Jack,\a146 she cried. \a145I swear that I will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can come of it if you enter that cottage\a148. Then, as I tried to shake her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.\a147\a160\a145Trust me, Jack!\a146 she cried. \a145Trust me only this once. You will never have cause to regret it. You know that I would not have a secret from you if it were not for your own sake. Our whole lives are at stake in this. If you come home with me, all will be well. If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.\a146\a147There was such earnestness, such despair, in her manner that her words arrested me, and I stood irresolute before the door.\a147\a160\a145I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only,\a146 said I at last. \a145It is that this mystery comes to an end from now. You are at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are kept from my knowledge. I am willing to forget those which are passed if you will promise that there shall be no more in the future.\a146\a147\a160\a145I was sure that you would trust me,\a146 she cried, with a great sigh of relief. \a145It shall be just as you wish. Come away\a151 oh, come away up to the house.\a146\a147Still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away from the cottage. As we went I glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face watching us out of the upper window. What link could there be between that creature and my wife. Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her. It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never know ease again until I had solved it.\a147For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of the house. On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty.\a147I had gone into town on that day, but I returned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36, which is my usual train. As I entered the house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.\a147\a160\a145Where is your mistress?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145I think that she has gone out for a walk,\a146 she answered.\a147My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage.\a147It was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago.\a147I stayed long enough to make certain that the house was absolutely empty. Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as I had never had before. My wife came out into the hall as I entered my house; but I was too hurt and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her, I made my way into my study. She followed me, however, before I could close the door.\a147\a160\a145I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,\a146 said she; \a145but if you knew all the circumstances I am sure that you would forgive me.\a146\a147\a160\a145Tell me everything, then,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145I cannot, Jack, I cannot,\a146 she cried.\a147\a160\a145Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph, there can never be any confidence between us,\a146 said I, and breaking away from her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr. Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I know anything more about this strange business. It is the first shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it. But, above all, tell me quickly what I am to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.\a148Holmes and I had listened with the utmost interest to this extraordinary statement, which had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a man who is under the influence of extreme emotions. My companion sat silent for some time, with his chin upon his hand, lost in thought.\a147Tell me,\a148 said he at last, \a147could you swear that this was a man\a146s face which you saw at the window?\a148\a147Each time that I saw it I was some distance away from it, so that it is impossible for me to say.\a148\a147You appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it.\a148\a147It seemed to be of an unnatural colour, and to have a strange rigidity about the features. When I approached, it vanished with a jerk.\a148\a147How long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?\a148\a147Nearly two months.\a148\a147Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?\a148\a147No; there was a great fire at Atlanta very shortly after his death, and all her papers were destroyed.\a148\a147And yet she had a certificate of death. You say that you saw it.\a148\a147Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.\a148\a147Did you ever meet any one who knew her in America?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Or get letters from it?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now. If the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of you coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have reason to believe that is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. We shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the business.\a148\a147And if it is still empty?\a148\a147In that case I shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with you. Good-by; and, above all, do not fret until you know that you really have a cause for it.\a148\a147I am afraid that this is a bad business, Watson,\a148 said my companion, as he returned after accompanying Mr. Grant Munro to the door. \a147What do you make of it?\a148\a147It had an ugly sound,\a148 I answered.\a147Yes. There\a146s blackmail in it, or I am much mistaken.\a148\a147And who is the blackmailer?\a148\a147Well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace. Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the window, and I would not have missed the case for worlds.\a148\a147You have a theory?\a148\a147Yes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised if it does not turn out to be correct. This woman\a146s first husband is in that cottage.\a148\a147Why do you think so?\a148\a147How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter it. The facts, as I read them, are something like this. This woman was married in America. Her husband developed some hateful qualities; or shall we say that he contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an imbecile. She flies from him at last, returns to England, changes her name, and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She has been married three years, and believes that her position is quite secure, having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose name she has assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered by her first husband; or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the invalid. They write to the wife, and threaten to come and expose her. She asks for a hundred pounds, and endeavours to buy them off. They come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there a new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavour to persuade them to leave her in peace. Having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her, as he has told us, as she comes out. She promises him then not to go there again, but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbours was too strong for her, and she made another attempt, taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. In the midst of this interview the maid rushed in to say that the master had come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurried the inmates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-trees, probably, which was mentioned as standing near. In this way he found the place deserted. I shall be very much surprised, however, if it still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you think of my theory?\a148\a147It is all surmise.\a148\a147But at least it covers all the facts. When new facts come to our knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough to reconsider it. We can do nothing more until we have a message from our friend at Norbury.\a148But we had not a very long time to wait for that. It came just as we had finished our tea. \a147The cottage is still tenanted,\a148 it said. \a147Have seen the face again at the window. Will meet the seven o\a146clock train, and will take no steps until you arrive.\a148He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation.\a147They are still there, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, laying his hand hard upon my friend\a146s sleeve. \a147I saw lights in the cottage as I came down. We shall settle it now once and for all.\a148\a147What is your plan, then?\a148 asked Holmes, as he walked down the dark tree-lined road.\a147I am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house. I wish you both to be there as witnesses.\a148\a147You are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife\a146s warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery?\a148\a147Yes, I am determined.\a148\a147Well, I think that you are in the right. Any truth is better than indefinite doubt. We had better go up at once. Of course, legally, we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but I think that it is worth it.\a148It was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.\a147There are the lights of my house,\a148 he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees. \a147And here is the cottage which I am going to enter.\a148We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.\a147There is that creature!\a148 cried Grant Munro. \a147You can see for yourselves that some one is there. Now follow me, and we shall soon know all.\a148We approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see her face in the he darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.\a147For God\a146s sake, don\a146t Jack!\a148 she cried. \a147I had a presentiment that you would come this evening. Think better of it, dear. Trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.\a148\a147I have trusted you tool long, Effie,\a148 he cried, sternly. \a147Leave go of me. I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle this matter once and forever!. He pushed her to one side, and we followed closely after him. As he threw the door open an old woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered at his heels.It was a cosy, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long white gloves on. As she whisked round to us, I gave a cry of surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any expression. An instant later the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child\a146s ear, a mask peeled off from her countenance, an there was a little coal black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her merriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching his throat.\a147My God!\a148 he cried. \a147What can be the meaning of this?\a148\a147I will tell you the meaning of it,\a148 cried the lady, sweeping into the room with a proud, set face. \a147You have forced me, against my own judgment, to tell you, and now we must both make the best of it. My husband died at Atlanta. My child survived.\a148\a147Your child?\a148She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. \a147You have never seen this open.\a148\a147I understood that it did not open.\a148She touched a spring, and the front hinged back. There was a portrait within of a man strikingly handsome and intelligent-looking, but bearing unmistakable signs upon his features of his African descent.\a147That is John Hebron, of Atlanta,\a148 said the lady, \a147and a nobler man never walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him, but never once while he lived did I for an instant regret it. It was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. It is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her father was. But dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother\a146s pet\a148. The little creature ran across at the words and nestled up against the lady\a146s dress. \a147When I left her in America,\a148 she continued, \a147it was only because her health was weak, and the change might have done her harm. She was given to the care of a faithful Scotch woman who had once been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. God forgive me, I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the courage to tell you. I had to choose between you, and in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl. For three years I have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. At last, however, there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I struggled against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger, I determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbour, without my appearing to be in any way connected with her. I pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about there being a black child in the neighbourhood. If I had been less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy with fear that you should learn the truth.\a147It was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. I should have waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement, and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awake you. But you saw me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. Next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. Three days later, however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. And now to-night you at last know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my child and me?\a148 She clasped her hands and waited for an answer.It was a long ten minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence, and when his answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door.\a147We can talk it over more comfortably at home,\a148 said he. \a147I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one than you have given me credit for being.\a148Holmes and I followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as we came out.\a147I think,\a148 said he, \a147that we shall be of more use in London than in Norbury.\a148Not another word did he say of the case until late that night, when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his bedroom.\a147Watson,\a148 said he, \a147if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper \a145Norbury\a146 in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.\a148\p\X1\BThe Stockbroker\a146s Clerk\B\X1\c\i\m="stoc-04.png"\i\cShortly after my marriage I had bought a connection in the Paddington district. Old Mr. Farquhar, from whom I purchased it, had at one time an excellent general practice; but his age, and an affliction of the nature of St. Vitus\a146s dance from which he suffered, had very much thinned it. The public not unnaturally goes on the principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. Thus as my predecessor weakened his practice declined, until when I purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three hundred a year. I had confidence, however, in my own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years the concern would be as flourishing as ever.For three months after taking over the practice I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I was too busy to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the \iBritish Medical Journal\i after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion\a146s voice.\a147Ah, my dear Watson,\a148 said he, striding into the room, \a147I am very delighted to see you. I trust that Mrs. Watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the Sign of Four.\a148\a147Thank you, we are both very well,\a148 said I, shaking him warmly by the hand.\a147And I hope, also,\a148 he continued, sitting down in the rocking-chair, \a147that the cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our little deductive problems.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 I answered, \a147it was only last night that I was looking over my old notes, and classifying some of our past results.\a148\a147I trust that you don\a146t consider your collection closed.\a148\a147Not at all. I should wish nothing better than to have some more of such experiences.\a148\a147To-day, for example?\a148\a147Yes, to-day, if you like.\a148\a147And as far off as Birmingham?\a148\a147Certainly, if you wish it.\a148\a147And the practice?\a148\a147I do my neighbour\a146s when he goes. He is always ready to work off the debt.\a148\a147Ha! Nothing could be better,\a148 said Holmes, leaning back in his chair and looking keenly at me from under his half closed lids. \a147I perceive that you have been unwell lately. Summer colds are always a little trying.\a148\a147I was confined to the house by a sever chill for three days last week. I thought, however, that I had cast off every trace of it.\a148\a147So you have. You look remarkably robust.\a148\a147How, then, did you know of it?\a148\a147My dear fellow, you know my methods.\a148\a147You deduced it, then?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147And from what?\a148\a147From your slippers.\a148I glanced down at the new patent leathers which I was wearing. \a147How on earth\a151\a148 I began, but Holmes answered my question before it was asked.\a147Your slippers are new,\a148 he said. \a147You could not have had them more than a few weeks. The soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. But near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the shopman\a146s hieroglyphics upon it. Damp would of course have removed this. You had, then, been sitting with our feet outstretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do even in so wet a June as this if he were in his full health.\a148Like all Holmes\a146s reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained. He read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.\a147I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain,\a148 said he. \a147Results without causes are much more impressive. You are ready to come to Birmingham, then?\a148\a147Certainly. What is the case?\a148\a147You shall hear it all in the train. My client is outside in a four-wheeler. Can you come at once?\a148\a147In an instant\a148. I scribbled a note to my neighbour, rushed upstairs to explain the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes upon the door-step.\a147Your neighbour is a doctor,\a148 said he, nodding at the brass plate.\a147Yes; he bought a practice as I did.\a148\a147An old-established one?\a148\a147Just the same as mine. Both have been ever since the houses were built.\a148\a147Ah! Then you got hold of the best of the two.\a148\a147I think I did. But how do you know?\a148\a147By the steps, my boy. Yours are worn three inches deeper than his. But this gentleman in the cab is my client, Mr. Hall Pycroft. Allow me to introduce you to him. Whip your horse up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch our train.\a148The man whom I found myself facing was a well built, fresh-complexioned young fellow, with a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow moustache. He wore a very shiny top hat and a neat suit of sober black, which made him look what he was\a151 a smart young City man, of the class who have been labelled cockneys, but who give us our crack volunteer regiments, and who turn out more fine athletes and sportsmen than any body of men in these islands. His round, ruddy face was naturally full of cheeriness, but the corners of his mouth seemed to me to be pulled down in a half-comical distress. It was not, however, until we were all in a first-class carriage and well started upon our journey to Birmingham that I was able to learn what the trouble was which had driven him to Sherlock Holmes.\a147We have a clear run here of seventy minutes,\a148 Holmes remarked. \a147I want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft, to tell my friend your very interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with more detail if possible. It will be of use to me to hear the succession of events again. It is a case, Watson, which may prove to have something in it, or may prove to have nothing, but which, at least, presents those unusual and \ioutr\a233\i features which are as dear to you as they are to me. Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall not interrupt you again.\a148Our young companion looked at me with a twinkle in his eye.The worst of the story is, said he, that I show myself up as such a confounded fool. Of course it may work out all right, and I don\a146t see that I could have done otherwise; but if I have lost my crib and get nothing in exchange I shall feel what a soft Johnnie I have been. I\a146m not very good at telling a story, Dr. Watson, but it is like this with me\a148I used to have a billet at Coxon & Woodhouse\a146s, of Draper\a146s Gardens, but they were let in early in the spring through the Venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came a nasty cropper. I had been with them five years, and old Coxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when the smash came, but of course we clerks were all turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. I tried here and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps on the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost for a long time. I had been taking three pounds a week at Coxon\a146s, and I had saved about seventy of them, but I soon worked my way through that and out at the other end. I was fairly at the end of my tether at last, and could hardly find the stamps to answer the advertisements or the envelopes to stick them to. I had worn out my boots paddling up office stairs, and I seemed just as far from getting a billet as ever.At last I saw a vacancy at Mawson & Williams\a146s, the great stock-broking firm in Lombard Street. I dare say EC is not much in your line, but I can tell you that this is about the richest house in London. The advertisement was to be answered by letter only. I sent in my testimonial and application, but without the least hope of getting it. Back came an answer by return, saying that if I would appear next Monday I might take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. No one knows how these things are worked. Some people say that the manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first that comes. Anyhow it was my innings that time, and I don\a146t ever wish to feel better pleased. The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties just about the same as at Coxon\a146s.And now I come to the queer part of the business. I was in diggings out Hampstead way, 17 Potter\a146s Terrace. Well, I was sitting doing a smoke that very evening after I had been promised the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card which had \a147Arthur Pinner, Financial Agent,\a148 printed upon it. I had never heard the name before and could not imagine what he wanted with me; but, of course, I asked her to show him up. In he walked, a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded man, with a touch of the Sheeny about his nose. He had a brisk kind of way with him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the value of time.\a147Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir,\a148 I answered, pushing a chair towards him.\a147Lately engaged at Coxon & Woodhouse\a146s?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And now on the staff of Mawson\a146s.\a148\a147Quite so.\a148\a147Well,\a148 said he, \a147the fact is that I have heard some really extraordinary stories about your financial ability. You remember Parker, who used to be Coxon\a146s manager. He can never say enough about it.\a148Of course I was pleased to hear this. I had always been pretty sharp in the office, but I had never dreamed that I was talked about in the City in this fashion.\a147You have a good memory?\a148 said he.\a147Pretty fair,\a148 I answered, modestly.\a147Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out of work?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes. I read the stock exchange list every morning.\a148\a147Now that shows real application!\a148 he cried. \a147That is the way to prosper. You won\a146t mind my testing you, will you. Let me see. How are Ayrshires?\a148\a147A hundred and six and a quarter to a hundred and five and seven-eighths.\a148\a147And New Zealand consolidated?\a148\a147A hundred and four.\a148\a147And British Broken Hills?\a148\a147Seven to seven-and-six.\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 he cried, with his hands up. \a147This quite fits in with all that I had heard. My boy, my boy, you are very much too good to be a clerk at Mawson\a146s!\a148This outburst rather astonished me, as you can think. \a147Well,\a148 said I, \a147other people don\a146t think quite so much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner. I had a hard enough fight to get this berth, and I am very glad to have it.\a148\a147Pooh, man; you should soar above it. You are not in your true sphere. Now, I\a146ll tell you how it stands with me. What I have to offer is little enough when measured by your ability, but when compared with Mawson\a146s, it\a146s light to dark. Let me see. When do you go to Mawson\a146s?\a148\a147On Monday.\a148\a147Ha, ha. I think I would risk a little sporting flutter that you don\a146t go there at all.\a148\a147Not go to Mawson\a146s?\a148\a147No, sir. By that day you will be the business manager of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, with a hundred and thirty-four branches in the towns and villages of France, not counting one in Brussels and one in San Remo.\a148This took my breath away. \a147I never heard of it,\a148 said I.\a147Very likely not. It has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all privately subscribed, and it\a146s too good a thing to let the public into. My brother, Harry Pinner, is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as managing director. He knew I was in the swim down here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap. A young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. Parker spoke of you, and that brought me here tonight. We can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start with.\a148\a147Five hundred a year!\a148 I shouted.\a147Only that at the beginning; but you are to have an overriding commission of one per cent on all business done by your agents, and you may take my word for it that this will come to more than your salary.\a148\a147But I know nothing about hardware.\a148\a147Tut, my boy; you know about figures.\a148My head buzzed, and I could hardly sit still in my chair. But suddenly a little chill of doubt came upon me.\a147I must be frank with you,\a148 said I. \a147Mawson only gives me two hundred, but Mawson is safe. Now, really, I know so little about your company that\a151\a148\a147Ah, smart, smart!\a148 he cried, in a kind of ecstasy of delight. \a147You are the very man for us. You are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. Now, here\a146s a note for a hundred pounds, and if you think that we can do business you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary.\a148\a147That is very handsome,\a148 said I. \a147When should I take over my new duties?\a148\a147Be in Birmingham to-morrow at one,\a148 said he. \a147I have a note in my pocket here which you will take to my brother. You will find him at 126b Corporation Street, where the temporary offices of the company are situated. Of course he must confirm your engagement, but between ourselves it will be all right.\a148\a147Really, I hardly know how to express my gratitude, Mr. Pinner,\a148 said I.\a147Not at all, my boy. You have only got your desserts. There are one or two small things\a151 mere formalities\a151 which I must arrange with you. You have a bit of paper beside you there. Kindly write upon it \a145I am perfectly willing to act as business manager to the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, at a minimum salary of \a163500.\a148I did as he asked, and he put the paper in his pocket.\a147There is one other detail,\a148 said he. \a147What do you intend to do about Mawson\a146s?\a148I had forgotten all about Mawson\a146s in my joy. \a147I\a146ll write and resign,\a148 said I.\a147Precisely what I don\a146t want you to do. I had a row over you with Mawson\a146s manager. I had gone up to ask him about you, and he was very offensive; accused me of coaxing you away from the service of the firm, and that sort of thing. At last I fairly lost my temper. \a145If you want good men you should pay them a good price,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145He would rather have our small price than your big one,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145I\a146ll lay you a fiver,\a146 said I, \a145that when he has my offer you\a146ll never so much as hear from him again.\a146\a147\a160\a145Done!\a146 said he. \a145We picked him out of the gutter, and he won\a146t leave us so easily\a148. Those were his very words.\a148\a147The impudent scoundrel!\a148 I cried. \a147I\a146ve never so much as seen him in my life. Why should I consider him in any way. I shall certainly not write if you would rather I didn\a146t.\a148\a147Good. That\a146s a promise,\a148 said he, rising from his chair. \a147Well, I\a146m delighted to have got so good a man for my brother. Here\a146s your advance of a hundred pounds, and here is the letter. Make a note of the address, 126b Corporation Street, and remember that one o\a146clock to-morrow is your appointment. Good-night; and may you have all the fortune that you deserve!\a148That\a146s just about all that passed between us, as near as I can remember. You can imagine, Dr. Watson, how pleased I was at such an extraordinary bit of good fortune. I sat up half the night hugging myself over it, and next day I was off to Birmingham in a train that would take me in plenty time for my appointment. I took my things to a hotel in New Street, and then I made my way to the address which had been given me.It was a quarter of an hour before my time, but I thought that would make no difference. 126b was a passage between two large shops, which led to a winding stone stair, from which there were many flats, let as offices to companies or professional men. The names of the occupants were painted at the bottom on the wall, but there was no such name as the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited. I stood for a few minutes with my heart in my boots, wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or not, when up came a man and addressed me. He was very like the chap I had seen the night before, the same figure and voice, but he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter.\a147Are you Mr. Hall Pycroft?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes,\a148 said I.\a147Oh! I was expecting you, but you are a trifle before your time. I had a note from my brother this morning in which he sang your praises very loudly.\a148\a147I was just looking for the offices when you came.\a148\a147We have not got our name up yet, for we only secured these temporary premises last week. Come up with me, and we will talk the matter over.\a148I followed him to the top of a very lofty stair, and there, right under the slates, were a couple of empty, dusty little rooms, uncarpeted and uncurtained, into which he led me. I had thought of a great office with shining tables and rows of clerks, such as I was used to, and I dare say I stared rather straight at the two deal chairs and one little table, which, with a ledger and a waste paper basket, made up the whole furniture.\a147Don\a146t be disheartened, Mr. Pycroft,\a148 said my new acquaintance, seeing the length of my face. \a147Rome was not built in a day, and we have lots of money at our backs, though we don\a146t cut much dash yet in offices. Pray sit down, and let me have your letter.\a148I gave it to him, and her read it over very carefully.\a147You seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother Arthur,\a148 said he; \a147and I know that he is a pretty shrewd judge. Hew swears by London, you know; and I by Birmingham; but this time I shall follow his advice. Pray consider yourself definitely engaged.\a148\a147What are my duties?\a148 I asked.\a147You will eventually manage the great depot in Paris, which will pour a flood of English crockery into the shops of a hundred and thirty-four agents in France. The purchase will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will remain in Birmingham and make yourself useful.\a148\a147How?\a148For answer, he took a big red book out of a drawer.\a147This is a directory of Paris,\a148 said he, \a147with the trades after the names of the people. I want you to take it home with you, and to mark off all the hardware sellers, with their addresses. It would be of the greatest use to me to have them.\a148\a147Surely there are classified lists?\a148 I suggested.\a147Not reliable ones. Their system is different from ours. Stick at it, and let me have the lists by Monday, at twelve. Good-day, Mr. Pycroft. If you continue to show zeal and intelligence you will find the company a good master.\a148I went back to the hotel with the big book under my arm, and with very conflicting feelings in my breast. On the one hand, I was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. However, come what might, I had my money, so I settled down to my task. All Sunday I was kept hard at work, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as H. I went round to my employer, found him in the same dismantled kind of room, and was told to keep at it until Wednesday, and then come again. On Wednesday it was still unfinished, so I hammered away until Friday\a151 that is, yesterday. Then I brought it round to Mr. Harry Pinner.\a147Thank you very much,\a148 said he; \a147I fear that I underrated the difficulty of the task. This list will be of very material assistance to me.\a148\a147It took some time,\a148 said I.\a147And now,\a148 said he, \a147I want you to make a list of the furniture shops, for they all sell crockery.\a148\a147Very good.\a148\a147And you can come up to-morrow evening, at seven, and let me know how you are getting on. Don\a146t overwork yourself. A couple of hours at Day\a146s Music Hall in the evening would do you no harm after your labours\a148. He laughed as he spoke, and I saw with a thrill that his second tooth upon the left-hand side had been very badly stuffed with gold.Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared with astonishment at our client.\a147You may well look surprised, Dr. Watson; but it is this way,\a148 said he. \a147When I was speaking to the other chap in London, at the time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson\a146s, I happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion. The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. When I put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out, and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent me from London to Birmingham. Why had he got there before me. And why had he written a letter from himself to himself. It was altogether too much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I had just time to get up to town by the night train to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me to Birmingham.\a148There was a pause after the stock-broker\a146s clerk had concluded his surprising experience. Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me, leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a comet vintage.\a147Rather fine, Watson, is it not?\a148 said he. \a147There are points in it which please me. I think that you will agree with me that an interview with Mr. Arthur Harry Pinner in the temporary offices of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, would be a rather interesting experience for both of us.\a148\a147But how can we do it?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, easily enough,\a148 said Hall Pycroft, cheerily. \a147You are two friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be more natural than that I should bring you both round to the managing director?\a148\a147Quite so, of course,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I should like to have a look at the gentleman, and see if I can make anything of his little game. What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your services so valuable? or is it possible that\a151\a148 He began biting his nails and staring blankly out of the window, and we hardly drew another word from him until we were in New Street.At seven o\a146clock that evening we were walking, the three of us, down Corporation Street to the company\a146s offices.\a147It is no use our being at all before our time,\a148 said our client. \a147He only comes there to see me, apparently, for the place is deserted up to the very hour he names.\a148\a147That is suggestive,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147By Jove, I told you so!\a148 cried the clerk. \a147That\a146s he walking ahead of us there.\a148He pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed man who was bustling along the other side of the road. As we watched him he looked across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he bought one from him. Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way.\a147There he goes!\a148 cried Hall Pycroft. \a147These are the company\a146s offices into which he has gone. Come with me, and I\a146ll fix it up as easily as possible.\a148Following his lead, we ascended five stories, until we found ourselves outside a half-opened door, at which our client tapped. A voice within bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished room such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the single table sat the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed to me that I had never looked upon a face which bore such marks of grief, and of something beyond grief\a151 of a horror such as comes to few men in a lifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish\a146s belly, and his eyes were wild and staring. He looked at his clerk as though he failed to recognize him, and I could see by the astonishment depicted upon our conductor\a146s face that this was by no means the usual appearance of his employer.\a147You look ill, Mr. Pinner!\a148 he exclaimed.\a147Yes, I am not very well,\a148 answered the other, making obvious efforts to pull himself together, and licking his dry lips before he spoke. \a147Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with you?\a148\a147One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and the other is Mr. Price, of this town,\a148 said our clerk, glibly. \a147They are friends of mine and gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the company\a146s employment.\a148\a147Very possibly! Very possibly!\a148 cried Mr. Pinner with a ghastly smile. \a147Yes, I have no doubt that we shall be able to do something for you. What is your particular line, Mr. Harris?\a148\a147I am an accountant,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Ah yes, we shall want something of the sort. And you, Mr. Price?\a148\a147A clerk,\a148 said I.\a147I have every hope that the company may accommodate you. I will let you know about it as soon as we come to any conclusion. And now I beg that you will go. For God\a146s sake leave me to myself!\a148These last words were shot out of him, as though the constraint which he was evidently setting upon himself had suddenly and utterly burst asunder. Holmes and I glanced at each other, and Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table.\a147You forget, Mr. Pinner, that I am here by appointment to receive some directions from you,\a148 said he.\a147Certainly, Mr. Pycroft, certainly,\a148 the other resumed in a calmer tone. \a147You may wait here a moment; and there is no reason why your friends should not wait with you. I will be entirely at your service in three minutes, if I might trespass upon your patience so far\a148. He rose with a very courteous air, and, bowing to us, he passed out through a door at the farther end of the room, which he closed behind him.\a147What now?\a148 whispered Holmes. \a147Is he giving us the slip?\a148\a147Impossible,\a148 answered Pycroft.\a147Why so?\a148\a147That door leads into an inner room.\a148\a147There is no exit?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Is it furnished?\a148\a147It was empty yesterday.\a148\a147Then what on earth can he be doing. There is something which I don\a146t understand in his manner. If ever a man was three parts mad with terror, that man\a146s name is Pinner. What can have put the shivers on him?\a148\a147He suspects that we are detectives,\a148 I suggested.\a147That\a146s it,\a148 cried Pycroft.Holmes shook his head. \a147He did not turn pale. He was pale when we entered the room,\a148 said he. \a147It is just possible that\a151\a148His words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat from the direction of the inner door.\a147What the deuce is he knocking at his own door for?\a148 cried the clerk.Again and much louder cam the rat-tat-tat. We all gazed expectantly at the closed door. Glancing at Holmes, I saw his face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement. Then suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a brisk drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang frantically across the room and pushed at the door. It was fastened on the inner side. Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door with a crash. Rushing over it, we found ourselves in the inner room. It was empty.But it was only for a moment that we were at fault. At one corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was a second door. Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the managing director of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. His knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the noise which had broken in upon our conversation. In an instant I had caught him round the waist, and held him up while Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between the livid creases of skin. Then we carried him into the other room, where he lay with a clay-coloured face, puffing his purple lips in and out with every breath\a151 a dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes before.\a147What do you think of him, Watson?\a148 asked Holmes.I stooped over him and examined him. His pulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breathing grew longer, and there was a little shivering of his eyelids, which showed a thin white slit of ball beneath.\a147It has been touch and go with him,\a148 said I, \a147but he\a146ll live now. Just open that window, and hand me the water carafe\a148. I undid his collar, poured the cold water over his face, and raised and sank his arms until he drew a long, natural breath. \a147It\a146s only a question of time now,\a148 said I, as I turned away from him.Holmes stood by the table, with his hands deep in his trouser\a146s pockets and his chin upon his breast.\a147I suppose we ought to call the police in now,\a148 said he. \a147And yet I confess that I\a146d like to give them a complete case when they come.\a148\a147It\a146s a blessed mystery to me,\a148 cried Pycroft, scratching his head. \a147Whatever they wanted to bring me all the way up here for, and then\a151\a148\a147Pooh. All that is clear enough,\a148 said Holmes impatiently. \a147It is this last sudden move.\a148\a147You understand the rest, then?\a148\a147I think that it is fairly obvious. What do you say, Watson?\a148I shrugged my shoulders. \a147I must confess that I am out of my depths,\a148 said I.\a147Oh surely if you consider the events at first they can only point to one conclusion.\a148\a147What do you make of them?\a148\a147Well, the whole thing hinges upon two points. The first is the making of Pycroft write a declaration by which he entered the service of this preposterous company. Do you not see how very suggestive that is?\a148\a147I am afraid I miss the point.\a148\a147Well, why did they want him to do it. Not as a business matter, for these arrangements are usually verbal, and there was no earthly business reason why this should be an exception. Don\a146t you see, my young friend, that they were very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting, and had no other way of doing it?\a148\a147And why?\a148\a147Quite so. Why. When we answer that we have made some progress with our little problem. Why. There can be only one adequate reason. Some one wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen of it first. And now if we pass on to the second point we find that each throws light upon the other. That point is the request made by Pinner that you should not resign your place, but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a Mr. Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the Monday morning.\a148\a147My God!\a148 cried our client, \a147what a blind beetle I have been!\a148\a147Now you see the point about the handwriting. Suppose that some one turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand from that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of course the game would have been up. But in the interval the rogue had learned to imitate you, and his position was therefore secure, as I presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you.\a148\a147Not a soul,\a148 groaned Hall Pycroft.\a147Very good. Of course it was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was at work in Mawson\a146s office. Therefore they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to London, where you might have burst their little game up. That is all plain enough.\a148\a147But why should this man pretend to be his own brother?\a148\a147Well, that is pretty clear also. There are evidently only two of them in it. The other is impersonating you at the office. This one acted as your engager, and then found that he could not find you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot. That he was most unwilling to do. He changed his appearance as far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance. But for the happy chance of the gold stuffing, your suspicions would probably never have been aroused.\a148Hall Pycroft shook his clinched hands in the air. \a147Good Lord!\a148 he cried, \a147while I have been fooled in this way, what has this other Hall Pycroft been doing at Mawson\a146s. What should we do, Mr. Holmes. Tell me what to do.\a148\a147We must wire to Mawson\a146s.\a148\a147They shut at twelve on Saturdays.\a148\a147Never mind. There may be some door-keeper or attendant\a151\a148\a147Ah yes, they keep a permanent guard there on account of the value of the securities that they hold. I remember hearing it talked of in the City.\a148\a147Very good; we shall wire to him, and see if all is well, and if a clerk of your name is working there. That is clear enough; but what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues should instantly walk out of the room and hang himself.\a148\a147The paper!\a148 croaked a voice behind us. The man was sitting up, blanched and ghastly, with returning reason in his eyes, and hands which rubbed nervously at the broad red band which still encircled his throat.\a147The paper. Of course!\a148 yelled Holmes, in a paroxysm of excitement. \a147Idiot that I was. I thought so must of our visit that the paper never entered my head for an instant. To be sure, the secret must be there\a148. He flattened it out upon the table, and a cry of triumph burst from his lips. \a147Look at this, Watson,\a148 he cried. \a147It is a London paper, an early edition of the \iEvening Standard\i. Here is what we want. Look at the headlines: \a145Crime in the City. Murder at Mawson & Williams\a146s. Gigantic attempted Robbery. Capture of the Criminal\a148. Here, Watson, we are all equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.\a148It appeared from its position in the paper to have been the one event of importance in town, and the account of it ran in this way:\a147A desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in the City. For some time back Mawson & Williams, the famous financial house, have been the guardians of securities which amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million sterling. So conscious was the manager of the responsibility which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at stake that safes of the very latest construction have been employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in the building. It appears that last week a new clerk named Hall Pycroft was engaged by the firm. This person appears to have been none other that Beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who, with his brother, had only recently emerged from a five years\a146 spell of penal servitude. By some mean, which are not yet clear, he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official position in the office, which he utilized in order to obtain moulding of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the position of the strong room and the safes.\a147It is customary at Mawson\a146s for the clerks to leave at midday on Saturday. Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. His suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of Constable Pollack succeeded, after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him. It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed. Nearly a hundred thousand pounds\a146 worth of American railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, was discovered in the bag. On examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where it would not have been discovered until Monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of Sergeant Tuson. The man\a146s skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind. There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him, and having murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then made off with his booty. His brother, who usually works with him, has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be ascertained, although the police are making energetic inquiries as to his whereabouts.\a148\a147Well, we may save the police some little trouble in that direction,\a148 said Holmes, glancing at the haggard figure huddled up by the window. \a147Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited. However, we have no choice as to our action. The doctor and I will remain on guard, Mr. Pycroft, if you will have the kindness to step out for the police.\a148\p\X1\BThe \a145Gloria Scott\a146\B\X1\c\i\m="glor-05.png"\i\c\a147I have some papers here,\a148 said my friend Sherlock Holmes, as we sat one winter\a146s night on either side of the fire, \a147which I really think, Watson, that it would be worth your while to glance over. These are the documents in the extraordinary case of the \iGloria Scott\i, and this is the message which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read it.\a148He had picked from a drawer a little tarnished cylinder, and, undoing the tape, he handed me a short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate gray-paper.\a147The supply of game for London is going steadily up,\a148 it ran. \a147Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, had been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant\a146s life.\a148As I glanced up from reading this enigmatical message, I saw Holmes chuckling at the expression upon my face.\a147You look a little bewildered,\a148 said he.\a147I cannot see how such a message as this could inspire horror. It seems to me to be rather grotesque than otherwise.\a148\a147Very likely. Yet the fact remains that the reader, who was a fine, robust old man, was knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt end of a pistol.\a148\a147You arouse my curiosity,\a148 said I. \a147But why did you say just now that there were very particular reasons why I should study this case?\a148\a147Because it was the first in which I was ever engaged.\a148I had often endeavored to elicit from my companion what had first turned is mind in the direction of criminal research, but had never caught him before in a communicative humour. Now he sat forward in this arm chair and spread out the documents upon his knees. Then he lit his pipe and sat for some time smoking and turning them over.\a147You never heard me talk of Victor Trevor?\a148 he asked. \a147He was the only friend I made during the two years I was at college. I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and working out my own little methods of thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes, and then my line of study was quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the only man I knew, and that only through the accident of his bull terrier freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel.\a147It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was effective. I was laid by the heels for ten days, but Trevor used to come in to inquire after me. At first it was only a minute\a146s chat, but soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of the term we were close friends. He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirits and energy, the very opposite to me in most respects, but we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond of union when I found that he was as friendless as I. Finally, he invited me down to his father\a146s place at Donnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation.\a147Old Trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration, a J.P., and a landed proprietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the north of Langmere, in the country of the Broads. The house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread, oak-beamed brick building, with a fine lime-lined avenue leading up to it. There was excellent wild-duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as I understood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that he would be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there.\a147Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend his only son.\a147There had been a daughter, I heard, but she had died of diphtheria while on a visit to Birmingham. The father interested me extremely. He was a man of little culture, but with a considerable amount of rude strength, both physically and mentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had travelled far, had seen much of the world. And had remembered all that he had learned. In person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes which were keen to the verge of fierceness. Yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity on the country-side, and was noted for the leniency of his sentences from the bench.\a147One evening, shortly after my arrival, we were sitting over a glass of port after dinner, when young Trevor began to talk about those habits of observation and inference which I had already formed into a system, although I had not yet appreciated the part which they were to play in my life. The old man evidently thought that his son was exaggerating in his description of one or two trivial feats which I had performed.\a147\a160\a145Come, now, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, laughing good-humouredly. \a145I\a146m an excellent subject, if you can deduce anything from me.\a146\a147\a160\a145I fear there is not very much,\a146 I answered; \a145I might suggest that you have gone about in fear of some personal attack within the last twelve months.\a146\a147The laugh faded from his lips, and he stared at me in great surprise.\a147\a160\a145Well, that\a146s true enough,\a146 said he. \a145You know, Victor,\a146 turning to his son, \a145when we broke up that poaching gang they swore to knife us, and Sir Edward Holly has actually been attacked. I\a146ve always been on my guard since then, though I have no idea how you know it.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have a very handsome stick,\a146 I answered. \a145By the inscription I observed that you had not had it more than a year. But you have taken some pains to bore the head of it and pour melted lead into the hole so as to make it a formidable weapon. I argued that you would not take such precautions unless you had some danger to fear.\a146\a147\a160\a145Anything else?\a146 he asked, smiling.\a147\a160\a145You have boxed a good deal in your youth.\a146\a147\a160\a145Right again. How did you know it. Is my nose knocked a little out of the straight?\a146\a147\a160\a145No,\a146 said I. \a145It is your ears. They have the peculiar flattening and thickening which marks the boxing man.\a146\a147\a160\a145Anything else?\a146\a147\a160\a145You have done a good deal of digging by your callosities.\a146\a147\a160\a145Made all my money at the gold fields.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have been in New Zealand.\a146\a147\a160\a145Right again.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have visited Japan.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite true.\a146\a147\a160\a145And you have been most intimately associated with some one whose initials were J. A., and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely forget.\a146\a147Mr. Trevor stood slowly up, fixed his large blue eyes upon me with a strange wild stare, and then pitched forward, with his face among the nutshells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint.\a147You can imagine, Watson, how shocked both his son and I were. His attack did not last long, however, for when we undid his collar, and sprinkled the water from one of the finger-glasses over his face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up.\a147\a160\a145Ah, boys,\a146 said he, forcing a smile, \a145I hope I haven\a146t frightened you. Strong as I look, there is a weak place in my heart, and it does not take much to knock me over. I don\a146t know how you manage this, Mr. Holmes, but it seems to me that all the detectives of fact and of fancy would be children in your hands. That\a146s your line of life, sir, and you may take the word of a man who has seen something of the world.\a146\a147And that recommendation, with the exaggerated estimate of my ability with which he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the very first thing which ever made me feel that a profession might be made out of what had up to that time been the merest hobby. At the moment, however, I was too much concerned at the sudden illness of my host to think of anything else.\a147\a160\a145I hope that I have said nothing to pain you?\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Well, you certainly touched upon rather a tender point. Might I ask how you know, and how much you know?\a148 He spoke now in a half-jesting fashion, but a look of terror still lurked at the back of his eyes.\a147\a160\a145It is simplicity itself,\a146 said I. \a145When you bared your arm to draw that fish into the boat I saw that J. A. Had been tattooed in the bend of the elbow. The letters were still legible, but it was perfectly clear from their blurred appearance, and from the staining of the skin round them, that efforts had been made to obliterate them. It was obvious, then, that those initials had once been very familiar to you, and that you had afterwards wished to forget them.\a146\a147What an eye you have!\a148 he cried, with a sigh of relief. \a145It is just as you say. But we won\a146t talk of it. Of all ghosts the ghosts of our old lovers are the worst. Come into the billiard-room and have a quiet cigar.\a146\a147From that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch of suspicion in Mr. Trevor\a146s manner towards me. Even his son remarked it. \a145You\a146ve given the governor such a turn,\a146 said he, \a145that he\a146ll never be sure again of what you know and what you don\a146t know\a148. He did not mean to show it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his mind that it peeped out at every action. At last I became so convinced that I was causing him uneasiness that I drew my visit to a close. On the very day, however, before I left, and incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of importance.\a147We were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs, the three of us, basking in the sun and admiring the view across the Broads, when a maid came out to say that there was a man at the door who wanted to see Mr. Trevor.\a147\a160\a145What is his name?\a146 asked my host.\a147\a160\a145He would not give any.\a146\a147\a160\a145What does he want, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145He says that you know him, and that he only wants a moment\a146s conversation.\a146\a147\a160\a145Show him round here\a148. An instant afterwards there appeared a little wizened fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling style of walking. He wore an open jacket, with a splotch of tar on the sleeve, a red-and-black check shirt, dungaree trousers, and heavy boots badly worn. His face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it, which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he came slouching across the lawn I heard Mr. Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. He was back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek of brandy as he passed me.\a147\a160\a145Well, my man,\a146 said he. \a145What can I do for you?\a146\a147The sailor stood looking at him with puckered eyes, and with the same loose-lipped smile upon his face.\a147\a160\a145You don\a146t know me?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Why, dear me, it is surely Hudson,\a146 said Mr. Trevor in a tone of surprise.\a147\a160\a145Hudson it is, sir,\a146 said the seaman. \a145Why, it\a146s thirty year and more since I saw you last. Here you are in your house, and me still picking my salt meat out of the harness cask.\a146\a147\a160\a145Tut, you will find that I have not forgotten old times,\a146 cried Mr. Trevor, and, walking towards the sailor, he said something in a low voice. \a145Go into the kitchen,\a146 he continued out loud, \a145and you will get food and drink. I have no doubt that I shall find you a situation.\a146\a147\a160\a145Thank you, sir,\a146 said the seaman, touching his fore-lock. \a145I\a146m just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed at that, and I wants a rest. I thought I\a146d get it either with Mr. Beddoes or with you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah!\a146 cried Trevor. \a145You know where Mr. Beddoes is?\a146\a147\a160\a145Bless you, sir, I know where all my old friends are,\a146 said the fellow with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen. Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having been shipmate with the man when he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn, he went indoors. An hour later, when we entered the house, we found him stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa. The whole incident left a most ugly impression upon my mind, and I was not sorry next day to leave Donnithorpe behind me, for I felt that my presence must be a source of embarrassment to my friend.\a147All this occurred during the first month of the long vacation. I went up to my London rooms, where I spent seven weeks working out a few experiments in organic chemistry. One day, however, when the autumn was far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close, I received a telegram from my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe, and saying that he was in great need of my advice and assistance. Of course I dropped everything and set out for the North once more.\a147He met me with the dog-cart at the station, and I saw at a glance that the last two months had been very trying ones for him. He had grown thin and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery manner for which he had been remarkable.\a147\a160\a145The governor is dying,\a146 were the first words he said.\a147\a160\a145Impossible!\a146 I cried. \a145What is the matter?\a146\a147\a160\a145Apoplexy. Nervous shock. He\a146s been on the verge all day. I doubt if we shall find him alive.\a146\a147I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at this unexpected news.\a147\a160\a145What has caused it?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Ah, that is the point. Jump in and we can talk it over while we drive. You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?\a146\a147\a160\a145Perfectly.\a146\a147\a160\a145Do you know who it was that we let into the house that day?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have no idea.\a146\a147\a160\a145It was the devil, Holmes,\a146 he cried.\a147I stared at him in astonishment.\a147\a160\a145Yes, it was the devil himself. We have not had a peaceful hour since\a151 not one. The governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now the life has been crushed out of him and his heart broken, all through this accursed Hudson.\a146\a147\a160\a145What power had he, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah, that is what I would give so much to know. The kindly, charitable, good old governor\a151 how could he have fallen into the clutches of such a ruffian. But I am so glad that you have come, Holmes. I trust very much to your judgment and discretion, and I know that you will advise me for the best.\a146\a147We were dashing along the smooth white country road, with the long stretch of the Broads in front of us glimmering in the red light of the setting sun. From a grove upon our left I could already see the high chimneys and the flag-staff which marked the squire\a146s dwelling.\a147\a160\a145My father made the fellow gardener,\a146 said my companion, \a145and then, as that did not satisfy him, he was promoted to be butler. The house seemed to be at his mercy, and he wandered about and did what he chose in it. The maids complained of his drunken habits and his vile language. The dad raised their wages all round to recompense them for the annoyance. The fellow would take the boat and my father\a146s best gun and treat himself to little shooting trips. And all this with such a sneering, leering, insolent face that I would have knocked him down twenty times over if he had been a man of my own age. I tell you, Holmes, I have had to keep a tight hold upon myself all this time; and now I am asking myself whether, if I had let myself go a little more, I might not have been a wiser man.\a147\a160\a145Well, matters went from bad to worse with us, and this animal Hudson became more and more intrusive, until at last, on making some insolent reply to my father in my presence one day, I took him by the shoulders and turned him out of the room. He slunk away with a livid face and two venomous eyes which uttered more threats than his tongue could do. I don\a146t know what passed between the poor dad and him after that, but the dad came to me next day and asked me whether I would mind apologizing to Hudson. I refused, as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household.\a145\a147Ah, my boy,\a148 said he, \a147it is all very well to talk, but you don\a146t know how I am placed. But you shall know, Victor. I\a146ll see that you shall know, come what may. You wouldn\a146t believe harm of your poor old father, would you, lad?\a148 He was very much moved, and shut himself up in the study all day, where I could see through the window that he was writing busily.\a147\a160\a145That evening there came what seemed to me to be a grand release, for Hudson told us that he was going to leave us. He walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and announced his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.\a145\a147I\a146ve had enough of Norfolk,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146ll run down to Mr. Beddoes in Hampshire. He\a146ll be as glad to see me as you were, I dare say.\a148\a145\a147You\a146re not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope,\a148 said my father, with a tameness which made my blood boil.\a145\a147I\a146ve not had my \a146pology,\a148 said he sulkily, glancing in my direction.\a145\a147Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow rather roughly,\a148 said the dad, turning to me.\a145\a147On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary patience towards him,\a148 I answered.\a145\a147Oh, you do, do you?\a148 he snarls. \a147Very good, mate. We\a146ll see about that!\a148\a147\a160\a145He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.\a146\a147\a160\a145And how?\a146 I asked eagerly.\a147\a160\a145In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.\a146\a147\a160\a145You horrify me, Trevor!\a146 I cried. \a145What then could have been in this letter to cause so dreadful a result?\a146\a147\a160\a145Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!\a146\a147As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we dashed up to the door, my friend\a146s face convulsed with grief, a gentleman in black emerged from it.\a147\a160\a145When did it happen, doctor?\a146 asked Trevor.\a147\a160\a145Almost immediately after you left.\a146\a147\a160\a145Did he recover consciousness?\a146\a147\a160\a145For an instant before the end.\a146\a147\a160\a145Any message for me.\a146\a147\a160\a145Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese cabinet.\a146\a147My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveller, and gold-digger, and how had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman. Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham. Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr. Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as describe by the son. He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a single sheet of gray paper. \a147The supply of game for London is going steadily up,\a146 it ran. \a145Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant\a146s life.\a146\a147I dare say my face looked as bewildered as your did just now when first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a prearranged significance to such phrases as \a145fly-paper\a146 and hen-pheasant\a146. Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the combination \a145life pheasant\a146s hen\a146 was not encouraging. Then I tried alternate words, but neither \a145the of for\a146 nor \a145supply game London\a146 promised to throw any light upon it.\a147And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.\a147It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my companion:\a147\a160\a145The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.\a146\a147Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, \a145It must be that, I suppose,\a146 said he. \a147This is worse than death, for it means disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these \a147head-keepers\a148 and \a147hen-pheasants\a148?\a147\a160\a145It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that he has begun by writing \a147The\a133game\a133is,\a148 and so on. Afterwards he had, to fulfil the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words in each space. He would naturally use the first words which came to his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested in breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?\a146\a147\a160\a145Why, now that you mention it,\a146 said he, \a145I remember that my poor father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his preserves every autumn.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,\a146 said I. \a145It only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and respected men.\a146\a147\a160\a145Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!\a146 cried my friend. \a145But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from Hudson had become imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he told the doctor. Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the strength nor the courage to do it myself.\a146\a147These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him. They are endorsed outside, as you see, \a145Some particulars of the voyage of the bark \iGloria Scott\i, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15\a176 20', W. Long. 25\a176 14' on Nov. 6th.\a146 It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this way:\a147\a160\a145My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you should come to blush for me\a151 you who love me and who have seldom, I hope, had reason to do other than respect me. But if the blow falls which is forever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give one thought to it again.\a147\a160\a145If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I swear as I hope for mercy.\a147\a160\a145My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was convicted of breaking my country\a146s laws, and was sentenced to transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a debt of honour, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with, but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a felon with thirty-seven other convicts in \a145tween-decks of the bark \iGloria Scott\i, bound for Australia.\a147\a160\a145It was the year \a14655 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The \iGloria Scott\i had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set said from Falmouth.\a147\a160\a145The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. I don\a146t think any of our heads would have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbour, and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated us.\a145\a147Hullo, chummy!\a148 said he, \a147what\a146s your name, and what are you here for?\a148\a147\a160\a145I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.\a145\a147I\a146m Jack Prendergast,\a148 said he, \a147and by God! You\a146ll learn to bless my name before you\a146ve done with me.\a148\a147\a160\a145I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but on incurably vicious habits, who had be an ingenious system of fraud obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.\a145\a147Ha, ha. You remember my case!\a148 said he proudly.\a145\a147Very well, indeed.\a148\a145\a147Then maybe you remember something queer about it?\a148\a145\a147What was that, then?\a148\a145\a147I\a146d had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn\a146t I?\a148\a145\a147So it was said.\a148\a145\a147But none was recovered, eh?\a148\a145\a147No.\a148\a145\a147Well, where d\a146ye suppose the balance is?\a148 he asked.\a145\a147I have no idea,\a148 said I.\a145\a147Right between my finger and thumb,\a148 he cried. \a147By God. I\a146ve got more pounds to my name than you\a146ve hairs on your head. And if you\a146ve money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do anything. Now, you don\a146t think it likely that a man who could do anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will look after his chums. You may lay to that. You hold on to him, and you may kiss the book that he\a146ll haul you through.\a148\a147\a160\a145That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader, and his money was the motive power.\a145\a147I\a146d a partner,\a148 said he, \a147a rare good man, as true as a stock to a barrel. He\a146s got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at this moment. Why, he\a146s the chaplain of this ship\a151 the chaplain, no less. He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He could buy \a146em at so much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they signed on. He\a146s got two of the warders and Mereer, the second mate, and he\a146d get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it.\a148\a145\a147What are we to do, then?\a148 I asked.\a145\a147What do you think?\a148 said he. \a147We\a146ll make the coats of some of these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did.\a148\a145\a147But they are armed,\a148 said I.\a145\a147And so shall we be, my boy. There\a146s a brace of pistols for every mother\a146s son of us, and if we can\a146t carry this ship, with the crew at our back, it\a146s time we were all sent to a young misses\a146 boarding-school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and see if he is to be trusted.\a148\a147\a160\a145I did so, and found my other neighbour to be a young fellow in much the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name was Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and his is now a rich and prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners who were not in the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and could not be of any use to us.\a147\a160\a145From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from taking possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians, specially picked for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts, and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were agents of Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. The captain, the two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected, and in this way.\a147\a160\a145One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized him. He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the captain\a146s cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business seemed to be settled.\a147\a160\a145The state-room was next to the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight that I think we should have given the job up if had not been for Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through the slit. We got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that ship. Predergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our enemies except just the warders the mates, and the doctor.\a147\a160\a145It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done. But there was no moving Predergast and those who were with him. Our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the offer, for we were already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered in Lat. 15\a176 and Long 25\a176 west, and then cut the painter and let us go.\a147\a160\a145And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear son. The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a light wind from the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de Verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the African coast about seven hundred to the east. On the whole, as the wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the bark being at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the \iGloria Scott\i. In an instant we swept the boat\a146s head round again and pulled with all our strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water marked the scene of this catastrophe.\a147\a160\a145It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until the following morning.\a147\a160\a145It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third mate. Prendergast then descended into the \a146tween-decks and with his own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. When he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. A dozen convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder-barrel, which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate\a146s match. Be the cause what I may, it was the end of the \iGloria Scott\i and of the rabble who held command of her.\a147\a160\a145Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the brig \iHotspur\i, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had foundered. The transport ship \iGloria Scott\i was set down by the Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate. After an excellent voyage the \iHotspur\i landed us at Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. The rest I need not relate. We prospered, we travelled, we came back as rich colonials to England, and we bought country estates. For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was forever buried. Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the wreck. He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live upon our fears. You will understand now how it was that I strove to keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his other victim with threats upon his tongue.\a146\a147Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible, \a145Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. Has told all. Sweet Lord, have mercy on our souls!\a146\a147That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one. The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on which the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared utterly and completely. No complaint had been lodged with he police, so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had done away with Beddoes and had fled. For myself I believe that the truth was exactly the opposite. I think that it is most probable that Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service.\a148\p\X1\BThe Musgrave Ritual\B\X1\c\i\m="musg-06.png"\i\cAn anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humours, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places. But his papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying documents, especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as I have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were followed by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his books, hardly moving save from the sofa to the table. Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner. One winter\a146s night, as we sat together by the fire, I ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in making our room a little more habitable. He could not deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box behind him. This he placed in the middle of the floor and, squatting down upon a stool in front of it, he threw back the lid. I could see that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages.\a147There are cases enough here, Watson,\a148 said he, looking at me with mischievous eyes. \a147I think that if you knew all that I had in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in.\a148\a147These are the records of your early work, then?\a148 I asked. \a147I have often wished that I had notes of those cases.\a148\a147Yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my biographer had come to glorify me\a148. He lifted bundle after bundle in a tender, caressing sort of way. \a147They are not all successes, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147But there are some pretty little problems among them. Here\a146s the record of the Tarleton murders, and the case of Vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old Russian woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch, as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the club-foot, and his abominable wife. And here\a151 ah, now, this really is something a little \irecherch\a233\i.\a148He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children\a146s toys are kept in. From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper, and old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it, and three rusty old disks of metal.\a147Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?\a148 he asked, smiling at my expression.\a147It is a curious collection.\a148\a147Very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as being more curious still.\a148\a147These relics have a history then?\a148\a147So much so that they \iare\i history.\a148\a147What do you mean by that?\a148Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one, and laid them along the edge of the table. Then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.\a147These,\a148 said he, \a147are all that I have left to remind me of the adventure of the Musgrave Ritual.\a148I had heard him mention the case more than once, though I had never been able to gather the details. \a147I should be so glad,\a148 said I, \a147if you would give me an account of it.\a148\a147And leave the litter as it is?\a148 he cried, mischievously. \a147Your tidiness won\a146t bear much strain after all, Watson. But I should be glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there are points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of this or, I believe, of any other country. A collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account of this very singular business.\a147You may remember how the affair of the \iGloria Scott\i, and my conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has become my life\a146s work. You see me now when my name has become known far and wide, and when I am generally recognized both by the public and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in doubtful cases. Even when you knew me first, at the time of the affair which you have commemorated in \iA Study in Scarlet\i, I had already established a considerable, though not a very lucrative, connection. You can hardly realize, then, how difficult I found it at first, and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any headway.\a147When I first came up to London I had rooms in Montague Street, just round the corner from the British Museum, and there I waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of science which might make me more efficient. Now and again cases came in my way, principally through the introduction of old fellow-students, for during my last years at the University there was a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods. The third of these cases was that of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events, and the large issues which proved to be at stake, that I trace my first stride towards to position which I now hold.\a147Reginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I had some slight acquaintance with him. He was not generally popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence. In appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in western Sussex, where the Manor House of Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county. Something of his birth place seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without associating him with gray archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk, and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.\a147For four years I had seen nothing of him until one morning he walked into my room in Montague Street. He had changed little, was dressed like a young man of fashion\a151 he was always a bit of a dandy\a151 and preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had formerly distinguished him.\a147\a160\a145How has all gone with you Musgrave?\a148 I asked, after we had cordially shaken hands.\a147\a160\a145You probably heard of my poor father\a146s death,\a146 said he; \a145he was carried off about two years ago. Since then I have of course had the Hurlstone estates to manage, and as I am member for my district as well, my life has been a busy one. But I understand, Holmes, that you are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to amaze us?\a148\a147\a160\a145Yes,\a146 said I, \a145I have taken to living by my wits.\a146\a147\a160\a145I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be exceedingly valuable to me. We have had some very strange doings at Hurlstone, and the police have been able to throw no light upon the matter. It is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable business.\a146\a147You can imagine with what eagerness I listened to him, Watson, for the very chance for which I had been panting during all those months of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. In my inmost heart I believed that I could succeed where others failed, and now I had the opportunity to test myself.\a147\a160\a145Pray, let me have the details,\a146 I cried.\a147Reginald Musgrave sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette which I had pushed towards him.\a147\a160\a145You must know,\a146 said he, \a145that though I am a bachelor, I have to keep up a considerable staff of servants at Hurlstone, for it is a rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after. I preserve, too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. Altogether there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy. The garden and the stables of course have a separate staff.\a147\a160\a145Of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was Brunton the butler. He was a young school-master out of place when he was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of great energy and character, and he soon became quite invaluable in the household. He was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty now. With his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts\a151 for he can speak several languages and play nearly every musical instrument\a151 it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a position, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and lacked energy to make any change. The butler of Hurlstone is always a thing that is remembered by all who visit us.\a147\a160\a145But this paragon has one fault. He is a bit of a Don Juan, and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part to play in a quiet country district. When he was married it was all right, but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble with him. A few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to settle down again for he became engaged to Rachel Howells, our second house-maid; but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the head game-keeper. Rachel\a151 who is a very good girl, but of an excitable Welsh temperament\a151 had a sharp touch of brain-fever, and goes about the house now\a151 or did until yesterday\a151 like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. That was our first drama at Hurlstone; but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.\a147\a160\a145This was how it came about. I have said that the man was intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did not in the least concern him. I had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry him, until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.\a147\a160\a145I have said that the house is a rambling one. One day last week\a151 on Thursday night, to be more exact\a151 I found that I could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong \icaf\a233 noir\i after my dinner. After struggling against it until two in the morning, I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which I was reading. The book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and started off to get it.\a147\a160\a145In order to reach the billiard-room I had to descend a flight of stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to the library and the gun-room. You can imagine my surprise when, as I looked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door of the library. I had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed. Naturally my first thought was of burglars. The corridors at Hurlstone have their walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons. From one of these I picked a battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door.\a147\a160\a145Brunton, the butler, was in the library. He was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked like a map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought. I stood dumb with astonishment, watching him from the darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From this he took a paper, and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he had been originally studying.\a145\a147So!\a148 said I. \a147This is how you repay the trust which we have reposed in you. You will leave my service to-morrow.\a148\a147\a160\a145He bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk past me without a word. The taper was still on the table, and by its light I glanced to see what the paper was which Brunton had taken from the bureau. To my surprise it was nothing of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through on his coming of age\a151 a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever.\a146\a147\a160\a145We had better come back to the paper afterwards,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145If you think it really necessary,\a146 he answered, with some hesitation. \a145To continue my statement, however. I relocked the bureau, using the key which Brunton had left, and I had turned to go when I was surprised to find that the butler had returned, and was standing before me.\a145\a147Mr. Musgrave, sir,\a148 he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with emotion, \a147I can\a146t bear disgrace, sir. I\a146ve always been proud above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will be on your head, sir\a151 it will, indeed\a151 if you drive me to despair. If you cannot keep me after what has passed, then for God\a146s sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I know so well.\a148\a145\a147You don\a146t deserve much consideration, Brunton,\a148 I answered. \a147Your conduct has been most infamous. However, as you have been a long time in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. A month, however is too long. Take yourself away in a week, and give what reason you like for going.\a148\a145\a147Only a week, sir?\a148 he cried, in a despairing voice. \a147A fortnight\a151 say at least a fortnight!\a148\a145\a147A week,\a148 I repeated, \a147and you may consider yourself to have been very leniently dealt with.\a148\a147\a160\a145He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken man, while I put out the light and returned to my room.\a147\a160\a145For two days after this Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to his duties. I made no allusion to what had passed, and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. On the third morning, however he did not appear, as was his custom, after breakfast to receive my instructions for the day. As I left the dining-room I happened to meet Rachel Howells, the maid. I have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being at work.\a145\a147You should be in bed,\a148 I said. \a147Come back to your duties when you are stronger.\a148\a147\a160\a145She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to suspect that her brain was affected.\a145\a147I am strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,\a148 said she.\a145\a147We will see what the doctor says,\a148 I answered. \a147You must stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton.\a148\a145\a147The butler is gone,\a148 said she.\a145\a147Gone. Gone where?\a148\a145\a147He is gone. No one has seen him. He is not in his room. Oh, yes, he is gone, he is gone!. She fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrified at this sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. The girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while I made inquiries about Brunton. There was no doubt about it that he had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room, but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. His slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. Where then could butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become of him now?\a147\a160\a145Of course we searched the house from cellar to garret, but there was no trace of him. It is, as I have said, a labyrinth of an old house, especially the original wing, which is now practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar without discovering the least sign of the missing man. It was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him, and yet where could he be. I called in the local police, but without success. Rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house, but in vain. Matters were in this state, when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery.\a147\a160\a145For two days Rachel Howells had been so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse had been employed to sit up with her at night. On the third night after Brunton\a146s disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping nicely, had dropped into a nap in the arm-chair, when shoe woke in the early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no signs of the invalid. I was instantly aroused, and, with the two footmen, started off at once in search of the missing girl. It was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for, starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanished close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds. The lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it.\a147\a160\a145Of course, we had the drags at once, and set to work to recover the remains, but no trace of the body could we find. On the other hand, we brought to the surface an object of a most unexpected kind. It was a linen bag which contained within it a mass of old rusted and discoloured metal and several dull-coloured pieces of pebble or glass. This strange find was all that we could get from the mere, and, although we made every possible search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of Rachel Howells or of Richard Brunton. The county police are at their wits\a146 end, and I have come up to you as a last resource.\a146\a147You can imagine, Watson, with what eagerness I listened to this extraordinary sequence of events, and endeavoured to piece them together, and to devise some common thread upon which they might all hang. The butler was gone. The maid was gone. The maid had loved the butler, but had afterwards had cause to hate him. She was of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate. She had been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance. She had flung into the lake a bag containing some curious contents. These were all factors which had to be taken into consideration, and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter. What was the starting-point of this chain of events. There lay the end of this tangled line.\a147\a160\a145I must see that paper, Musgrave,\a146 said I, \a145which this butler of your thought it worth his while to consult, even at the risk of the loss of his place.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is rather an absurd business, this ritual of ours,\a146 he answered. \a145But it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to excuse it. I have a copy of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them.\a146\a147He handed me the very paper which I have here, Watson, and this is the strange catechism to which each Musgrave had to submit when he came to man\a146s estate. I will read you the questions and answers as they stand.\c\i\a147\a160\a145Whose was it?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145His who is gone.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Who shall have it?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145He who will come.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Where was the sun?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Over the oak.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Where was the shadow?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Under the elm.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147How was it stepped?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145What shall we give for it?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145All that is ours.\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145Why should we give it?\a146\i\c\c\i\a147\a160\a145For the sake of the trust.\a146\i\c\a147\a160\a145The original has no date, but is in the spelling of the middle of the seventeenth century,\a146 remarked Musgrave. \a145I am afraid, however, that it can be of little help to you in solving this mystery.\a146\a147\a160\a145At least,\a146 said I, \a145it gives us another mystery, and one which is even more interesting than the first. It may be that the solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other. You will excuse me, Musgrave, if I say that your butler appears to me to have been a very clever man, and to have had a clearer insight that ten generations of his masters.\a146\a147\a160\a145I hardly follow you,\a146 said Musgrave. \a145The paper seems to me to be of no practical importance.\a146\a147\a160\a145But to me it seems immensely practical, and I fancy that Brunton took the same view. He had probably seen it before that night on which you caught him.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is very possible. We took no pains to hide it.\a146\a147\a160\a145He simply wished, I should imagine, to refresh his memory upon that last occasion. He had, as I understand, some sort of map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript, and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared.\a146\a147\a160\a145That is true. But what could he have to do with this old family custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?\a146\a147\a160\a145I don\a146t think that we should have much difficulty in determining that,\a146 said I; \a145with your permission we will take the first train down to Sussex, and go a little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.\a146\a147The same afternoon saw us both at Hurlstone. Possibly you have seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building, so I will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in the shape of an L, the long arm being the more modern portion, and the shorter the ancient nucleus, from which the other had developed. Over the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of this old part, is chiselled the date, 1607, but experts are agreed that the beams and stone-work are really much older than this. The enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the last century driven the family into building the new wing, and the old one was used now as a store-house and a cellar, when it was used at all. A splendid park with fine old timber surrounds the house, and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from the building.\a147I was already firmly convinced, Watson, that there were not three separate mysteries here, but one only, and that if I could read the Musgrave Ritual aright I should hold in my hand the clue which would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler Brunton and the maid Howells. To that then I turned all my energies. Why should this servant be so anxious to master this old formula. Evidently because he saw something in it which had escaped all those generations of country squires, and from which he expected some personal advantage. What was it then, and how had it affected his fate?\a147It was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the ritual, that the measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the document alluded, and that if we could find that spot, we should be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was which the old Musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a fashion. There were two guides given us to start with, an oak and an elm. As to the oak there could be no question at all. Right in front of the house, upon the left-hand side of the drive, there stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.\a147\a160\a145That was there when you ritual was drawn up,\a146 said I, as we drove past it.\a147\a160\a145It was there at the Norman Conquest in all probability,\a146 he answered. \a145It has a girth of twenty-three feet.\a146\a147\a160\a145Have you any old elms?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145There used to be a very old one over yonder but it was struck by lightning ten years ago, and we cut down the stump,\a146\a147\a160\a145You can see where it used to be?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145There are no other elms?\a146\a147\a160\a145No old ones, but plenty of beeches.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should like to see where it grew.\a146\a147We had driven up in a dogcart, and my client led me away at once, without our entering the house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had stood. It was nearly midway between the oak and the house. My investigation seemed to be progressing.\a147\a160\a145I suppose it is impossible to find out how high the elm was?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145I can give you it at once. It was sixty-four feet.\a146\a147\a160\a145How do you come to know it?\a146 I asked, in surprise.\a147\a160\a145When my old tutor used to give me an exercise in trigonometry, it always took the shape of measuring heights. When I was a lad I worked out every tree and building in the estate.\a146\a147This was an unexpected piece of luck. My data were coming more quickly than I could have reasonably hoped.\a147\a160\a145Tell me,\a146 I asked, \a145did your butler ever ask you such a question?\a146\a147Reginald Musgrave looked at me in astonishment. \a145Now that you call it to my mind,\a146 he answered, \a145Brunton did ask me about the height of the tree some months ago, in connection with some little argument with the groom,\a146\a147This was excellent news, Watson, for it showed me that I was on the right road. I looked up at the sun. It was low in the heavens, and I calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak. One condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be fulfilled. And the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide. I had, then, to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak.\a148\a147That must have been difficult, Holmes, when the elm was no longer there.\a148\a147Well, at least I knew that if Brunton could do it, I could also. Besides, there was no real difficulty. I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long string with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my client to where the elm had been. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine feet in length.\a147Of course the calculation now was a simple one. If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course the line of the other. I measured out the distance, which brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements, and that I was still upon his trail.\a147From this starting-point I proceeded to step, having first taken the cardinal points by my pocket-compass. Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again I marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south. It brought me to the very threshold of the old door. Two steps to the west meant now that I was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was the place indicated by the Ritual.\a147Never have I felt such a cold chill of disappointment, Watson. For a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake in my calculations. The setting sun shone full upon the passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-worn gray stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together, and had certainly not been moved for many a long year. Brunton had not been at work here. I tapped upon the floor, but it sounded the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice. But, Fortunately, Musgrave, who had begun to appreciate the meaning of my proceedings, and who was now as excited as myself, took out his manuscript to check my calculation.\a147\a160\a145And under,\a146 he cried. \a145You have omitted the \a147and under.\a148\a146\a147I had thought that it meant that we were to dig, but now, of course, I saw at once that I was wrong. \a145There is a cellar under this then?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Yes, and as old as the house. Down here, through this door.\a146\a147We went down a winding stone stair, and my companion, striking a match, lit a large lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner. In an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the true place, and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently.\a147It had been used for the storage of wood, but the billets, which had evidently been littered over the floor, were now piled at the sides, so as to leave a clear space in the middle. In this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rusted iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd\a146s-check muffler was attached.\a147\a160\a145By Jove!\a146 cried my client. \a145That\a146s Brunton\a146s muffler. I have seen it on him, and could swear to it. What has the villain been doing here?\a146\a147At my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to be present, and I then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling on the cravat. I could only move it slightly, and it was with the aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying it to one side. A black hole yawned beneath into which we all peered, while Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the lantern.\a147A small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay open to us. At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood, so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it. Several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such as I hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it contained nothing else.\a147At the moment, however, we had no thought for the old chest, for our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it. It was the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down upon him hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on each side of it. The attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could have recognized that distorted liver-coloured countenance; but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. He had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end. When his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started.\a147I confess that so far, Watson, I had been disappointed in my investigation. I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions. It is true that I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had disappeared. I sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over.\a147You know my methods in such cases, Watson. I put myself in the man\a146s place and, having first gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances. In this case the matter was simplified by Brunton\a146s intelligence being quite first-rate, so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation, as the astronomers have dubbed it. He know that something valuable was concealed. He had spotted the place. He found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided. What would he do next. He could not get help from outside, even if he had some one whom he could trust, without the unbarring of doors and considerable risk of detection. It was better, if he could, to have his helpmate inside the house. But whom could he ask. This girl had been devoted to him. A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman\a146s love, however badly he may have treated her. He would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then would engage her as his accomplice. Together they would come at night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to raise the stone. So far I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen them.\a147But for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy work the raising of that stone. A burly Sussex policeman and I had found it no light job. What would they do to assist them. Probably what I should have done myself. I rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor. Almost at once I came upon what I expected. One piece, about three feet in length, had a very marked indentation at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight. Evidently, as they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of this other slab. So far I was still on safe ground.\a147And now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama. Clearly, only one could fit into the hole, and that one was Brunton. The girl must have waited above. Brunton then unlocked the box, handed up the contents presumably\a151 since they were not to be found\a151 and then\a151 and then what happened?\a147What smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate Celtic woman\a146s soul when she saw the man who had wronged her\a151 wronged her, perhaps, far more than we suspected\a151 in her power. Was it a chance that the wood had slipped, and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become his sepulchre. Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate. Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place. Be that as it might, I seemed to see that woman\a146s figure still clutching at her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover\a146s life out.\a147Here was the secret of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. But what had been in the box. What had she done with that. Of course, it must have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged from the mere. She had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime.\a147For twenty minutes I had sat motionless, thinking the matter out. Musgrave still stood with a very pale face, swinging his lantern and peering down into the hole.\a147\a160\a145These are coins of Charles the First,\a146 said he, holding out the few which had been in the box; \a145you see we were right in fixing our date for the Ritual.\a146\a147\a160\a145We may find something else of Charles the First,\a146 I cried, as the probable meaning of the first two question of the Ritual broke suddenly upon me. \a145Let me see the contents of the bag which you fished from the mere.\a146\a147We ascended to his study, and he laid the \id\a233bris\i before me. I could understand his regarding it as of small importance when I looked at it, for the metal was almost black and the stones lustreless and dull. I rubbed one of them on my sleeve, however, and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my hand. The metal work was in the form of a double ring, but it had been bent and twisted out of its original shape.\a147\a160\a145You must bear in mind,\a146 said I, \a145that the royal party made head in England even after the death of the king, and that when they at last fled they probably left many of their most precious possessions buried behind them, with the intention of returning for them in more peaceful times.\a146\a147\a160\a145My ancestor, Sir Ralph Musgrave, as a prominent Cavalier and the right-hand man of Charles the Second in his wanderings,\a146 said my friend.\a147\a160\a145Ah, indeed!\a146 I answered. \a145Well now, I think that really should give us the last link that we wanted. I must congratulate you on coming into the possession, though in rather a tragic manner of a relic which is of great intrinsic value, but of even greater importance as an historical curiosity.\a146\a147\a160\a145What is it, then?\a146 he gasped in astonishment.\a147\a160\a145It is nothing less than the ancient crown of the kings of England.\a146\a147\a160\a145The crown!\a146\a147\a160\a145Precisely. Consider what the Ritual says. How does it run. \a147Whose was it?\a148 \a147His who is gone\a148. That was after the execution of Charles. Then, \a147Who shall have it?\a148 \a147He who will come\a148. That was Charles the Second, whose advent was already foreseen. There can, I think, be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem once encircled the brows of the royal Stuarts.\a146\a147\a160\a145And how came it in the pond?\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah, that is a question that will take some time to answer\a148. And with that I sketched out to him the whole long chain of surmise and of proof which I had constructed. The twilight had closed in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.\a147\a160\a145And how was it then that Charles did not get his crown when he returned?\a146 asked Musgrave, pushing back the relic into its linen bag.\a147\a160\a145Ah, there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall probably never be able to clear up. It is likely that the Musgrave who held the secret died in the interval, and by some oversight left this guide to his descendant without explaining the meaning of it. From that day to this it has been handed down from father to son, until at last it came within reach of a man who tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the venture.\a146\a147And that\a146s the story of the Musgrave Ritual, Watson. They have the crown down at Hurlstone\a151 though they had some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it. I am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show it to you. Of the woman nothing was ever heard, and the probability is that she got away out of England and carried herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the seas.\a148\p\X1\BThe Reigate Squire\B\X1\c\i\m="reig-04.png"\i\cIt was some time before the health of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring of \a14687. The whole question of the Netherland-Sumatra Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public, and are too intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting subjects for this series of sketches. They led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle against crime.On referring to my notes I see that it was upon the 14th of April that I received a telegram from Lyons which informed me that Holmes was lying ill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms. Even his iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months, during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. Even the triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when Europe was ringing with his name and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams I found him a prey to the blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in Europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration.Three days later we were back in Baker Street together; but it was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change, and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full of attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had come under my professional care in Afghanistan, had now taken a house near Reigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit. On the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from Lyons we were under the Colonel\a146s roof. Hayter was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and he had much in common.On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel\a146s gun-room after dinner, Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I looked over his little armoury of Eastern weapons.\a147By the way,\a148 said he suddenly, \a147I think I\a146ll take one of these pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.\a148\a147An alarm!\a148 said I.\a147Yes, we\a146ve had a scare in this part lately. Old Acton, who is one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last Monday. No great damage done, but the fellows are still at large.\a148\a147No clue?\a148 asked Holmes, cocking his eye at the Colonel.\a147None as yet. But the affair is a pretty one, one of our little country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, Mr. Holmes, after this great international affair.\a148Holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it had pleased him.\a147Was there any feature of interest?\a148\a147I fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library and got very little for their pains. The whole place was turned upside down, drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that an odd volume of Pope\a146s \a145Homer,\a146 two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that have vanished.\a148\a147What an extraordinary assortment!\a148 I exclaimed.\a147Oh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could get.\a148Holmes grunted from the sofa.\a147The county police ought to make something of that,\a148 said he; \a147why, it is surely obvious that\a151\a148But I held up a warning finger.\a147You are here for a rest, my dear fellow. For Heaven\a146s sake don\a146t get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the Colonel, and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels.It was destined, however, that all my professional caution should be wasted, for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our country visit took a turn which neither of us could have anticipated. We were at breakfast when the Colonel\a146s butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.\a147Have you heard the news, sir?\a148 he gasped. \a147At the Cunningham\a146s sir!\a148\a147Burglary!\a148 cried the Colonel, with his coffee-cup in mid-air.\a147Murder!\a148The Colonel whistled. \a147By Jove!\a148 said he. \a147Who\a146s killed, then. The J.P. or his son?\a148\a147Neither, sir. It was William the coachman. Shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke again.\a148\a147Who shot him, then?\a148\a147The burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got clean away. He\a146d just broke in at the pantry window when William came on him and met his end in saving his master\a146s property.\a148\a147What time?\a148\a147It was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.\a148\a147Ah, then, we\a146ll step over afterwards,\a148 said the Colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast again. \a147It\a146s a baddish business,\a148 he added when the butler had gone; \a147he\a146s our leading man about here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow too. He\a146ll be cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years and was a good servant. It\a146s evidently the same villains who broke into Acton\a146s.\a148\a147And stole that very singular collection,\a148 said Holmes, thoughtfully.\a147Precisely.\a148\a147Hum. It may prove the simplest matter in the world, but all the same at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not. A gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days. When you spoke last night of taking precautions I remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in England to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention\a151 which shows that I have still much to learn.\a148\a147I fancy it\a146s some local practitioner,\a148 said the Colonel. \a147In that case, of course, Acton\a146s and Cunningham\a146s are just the places he would go for, since they are far the largest about here.\a148\a147And richest?\a148\a147Well, they ought to be, but they\a146ve had a lawsuit for some years which has sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy. Old Acton has some claim on half Cunningham\a146s estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both hands.\a148\a147If it\a146s a local villain there should not be much difficulty in running him down,\a148 said Holmes with a yawn. \a147All right, Watson, I don\a146t intend to meddle.\a148\a147Inspector Forrester, sir,\a148 said the butler, throwing open the door.The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the room. \a147Good-morning, Colonel,\a148 said he; \a147I hope I don\a146t intrude, but we hear that Mr. Holmes of Baker Street is here.\a148The Colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the Inspector bowed.\a147We thought that perhaps you would care to step across, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147The fates are against you, Watson,\a148 said he, laughing. \a147We were chatting about the matter when you came in, Inspector. Perhaps you can let us have a few details\a148. As he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude I knew that the case was hopeless.\a147We had no clue in the Acton affair. But here we have plenty to go on, and there\a146s no doubt it is the same party in each case. The man was seen.\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147Yes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor William Kirwan was fired. Mr. Cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him from the back passage. It was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. They both heard William the coachman calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what was the matter. The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. One of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. Mr. Cunningham, looking out of his bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. Mr. Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.\a148\a147What was this William doing there. Did he say anything before he died?\a148\a147Not a word. He lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course this Acton business has put every one on their guard. The robber must have just burst open the door\a151 the lock has been forced\a151 when William came upon him.\a148\a147Did William say anything to his mother before going out?\a148\a147She is very old and deaf, and we can get no information from her. The shock has made her half-witted, but I understand that she was never very bright. There is one very important circumstance, however. Look at this!\a148He took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee.\a147This was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. It appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. You will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate. You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it were an appointment.\a148Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a fac-simile of which is here reproduced.\q="#rs_note1"\c\i\m="reig-1i.png"\i\q\c\a147Presuming that it is an appointment,\a148 continued the Inspector, \a147it is of course a conceivable theory that this William Kirwan\a151 though he had the reputation of being an honest man, may have been in league with the thief. He may have met him there, may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may have fallen out between themselves.\a148\a147This writing is of extraordinary interest,\a148 said Holmes, who had been examining it with intense concentration. \a147These are much deeper waters than I had though\a148. He sank his head upon his hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the famous London specialist.\a147Your last remark,\a148 said Holmes, presently, \a147as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely impossible supposition. But this writing opens up\a151\a148 He sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought. When he raised his face again, I was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with colour, and his eyes as bright as before his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his old energy.\a147I\a146ll tell you what,\a148 said he, \a147I should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case. There is something in it which fascinates me extremely. If you will permit me, Colonel, I will leave my friend Watson and you, and I will step round with the Inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine. I will be with you again in half an hour.\a148An hour and half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone.\a147Mr. Holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,\a148 said he. \a147He wants us all four to go up to the house together.\a148\a147To Mr. Cunningham\a146s?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147What for?\a148The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. \a147I don\a146t quite know, sir. Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his illness yet. He\a146s been behaving very queerly, and he is very much excited.\a148\a147I don\a146t think you need alarm yourself,\a148 said I. \a147I have usually found that there was method in his madness.\a148\a147Some folks might say there was madness in his method,\a148 muttered the Inspector. \a147But he\a146s all on fire to start, Colonel, so we had best go out if you are ready.\a148We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets.\a147The matter grows in interest,\a148 said he. \a147Watson, your country-trip has been a distinct success. I have had a charming morning.\a148\a147You have been up to the scene of the crime, I understand,\a148 said the Colonel.\a147Yes; the Inspector and I have made quite a little reconnaissance together.\a148\a147Any success?\a148\a147Well, we have seen some very interesting things. I\a146ll tell you what we did as we walk. First of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as reported.\a148\a147Had you doubted it, then?\a148\a147Oh, it is as well to test everything. Our inspection was not wasted. We then had an interview with Mr. Cunningham and his son, who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had broken through the garden-hedge in his flight. That was of great interest.\a148\a147Naturally.\a148\a147Then we had a look at this poor fellow\a146s mother. We could get no information from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.\a148\a147And what is the result of your investigations?\a148\a147The conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one. Perhaps our visit now may do something to make it less obscure. I think that we are both agreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in the dead man\a146s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his death written upon it, is of extreme importance.\a148\a147It should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147It \idoes\i give a clue. Whoever wrote that note was the man who brought William Kirwan out of his bed at that hour. But where is the rest of that sheet of paper?\a148\a147I examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,\a148 said the Inspector.\a147It was torn out of the dead man\a146s hand. Why was some one so anxious to get possession of it. Because it incriminated him. And what would he do with it. Thrust it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.\a148\a147Yes, but how can we get at the criminal\a146s pocket before we catch the criminal?\a148\a147Well, well, it was worth thinking over. Then there is another obvious point. The note was sent to William. The man who wrote it could not have taken it; otherwise, of course, he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth. Who brought the note, then. Or did it come through the post?\a148\a147I have made inquiries,\a148 said the Inspector. \a147William received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back. \a147You\a146ve seen the postman. It is a pleasure to work with you. Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you the scene of the crime.\a148We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the kitchen door.\a147Throw the door open, officer,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, it was on those stairs that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at that window\a151 the second on the left\a151 and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man. The ground is very hard, you see, and there are no marks to guide us\a148. As he spoke two men came down the garden path, from round the angle of the house. The one was an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contract with the business which had brought us there.\a147Still at it, then?\a148 said he to Holmes. \a147I thought you Londoners were never at fault. You don\a146t seem to be so very quick, after all.\a148\a147Ah, you must give us a little time,\a148 said Holmes good-humouredly.\a147You\a146ll want it,\a148 said young Alec Cunningham. \a147Why, I don\a146t see that we have any clue at all.\a148\a147There\a146s only one,\a148 answered the Inspector. \a147We thought that if we could only find\a151 Good heavens, Mr. Holmes. What is the matter?\a148My poor friend\a146s face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful expression. His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a large chair, and breathed heavily for some minutes. Finally, with a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.\a147Watson would tell you that I have only just recovered from a severe illness,\a148 he explained. \a147I am liable to these sudden nervous attacks.\a148\a147Shall I send you home in my trap?\a148 asked old Cunningham.\a147Well, since I am here, there is one point on which I should like to feel sure. We can very easily verify it.\a148\a147What was it?\a148\a147Well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow William was not before, but after, the entrance of the burglary into the house. You appear to take it for granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got in.\a148\a147I fancy that is quite obvious,\a148 said Mr. Cunningham, gravely. \a147Why, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard any one moving about.\a148\a147Where was he sitting?\a148\a147I was smoking in my dressing-room.\a148\a147Which window is that?\a148\a147The last on the left next my father\a146s.\a148\a147Both of your lamps were lit, of course?\a148\a147Undoubtedly.\a148\a147There are some very singular points here,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147Is it not extraordinary that a burglary\a151 and a burglar who had had some previous experience\a151 should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?\a148\a147He must have been a cool hand.\a148\a147Well, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation,\a148 said young Mr. Alec. \a147But as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house before William tackled him, I think it a most absurd notion. Wouldn\a146t we have found the place disarranged, and missed the things which he had taken?\a148\a147It depends on what the things were,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from Acton\a146s\a151 what was it?\a151 a ball of string, a letter-weight, and I don\a146t know what other odds and ends.\a148\a147Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said old Cunningham. \a147Anything which you or the Inspector may suggest will most certainly be done.\a148\a147In the first place,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I should like you to offer a reward\a151 coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought.\a148\a147I would willingly give five hundred,\a148 said the J.P., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. \a147This is not quite correct, however,\a148 he added, glancing over the document.\a147I wrote it rather hurriedly.\a148\a147You see you begin, \a145Whereas, at about a quarter to one on Tuesday morning an attempt was made,\a146 and so on. It was at a quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.\a148I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. It was his specialty to be accurate as to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself. He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into a laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and handed the paper back to Holmes.\a147Get it printed as soon as possible,\a148 he said; \a147I think your idea is an excellent one.\a148Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket-book.\a147And now,\a148 said he, \a147it really would be a good thing that we should all go over the house together and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.\a148Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced. It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. We could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.\a147You don\a146t use bars, then?\a148 he asked.\a147We have never found it necessary.\a148\a147You don\a146t keep a dog?\a148\a147Yes, but he is chained on the other side of the house.\a148\a147When do the servants go to bed?\a148\a147About ten.\a148\a147I understand that William was usually in bed also at that hour.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147It is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. Now, I should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house, Mr. Cunningham.\a148A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including those of Mr. Cunningham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of the architecture of the house. I could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.\a147My good sir,\a148 said Mr. Cunningham with some impatience, \a147this is surely very unnecessary. That is my room at the end of the stairs, and my son\a146s is the one beyond it. I leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us.\a148\a147You must try round and get on a fresh scent, I fancy,\a148 said the son with a rather malicious smile.\a147Still, I must ask you to humour me a little further. I should like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front. This, I understand is your son\a146s room\a148\a151 he pushed open the door\a151\a147and that, I presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. Where does the window of that look out to?\a148 He stepped across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber.\a147I hope that you are satisfied now?\a148 said Mr. Cunningham, tartly.\a147Thank you, I think I have seen all that I wished.\a148\a147Then if it is really necessary we can go into my room.\a148\a147If it is not too much trouble.\a148The J. P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. As we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room.\a147You\a146ve done it now, Watson,\a148 said he, coolly. \a147A pretty mess you\a146ve made of the carpet.\a148I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit, understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself. The others did the same, and set the table on its legs again.\a147Hullo!\a148 cried the Inspector, \a147where\a146s he got to?\a148Holmes had disappeared.\a147Wait here an instant,\a148 said young Alec Cunningham. \a147The fellow is off his head, in my opinion. Come with me, father, and see where he has got to!\a148They rushed out of the room, leaving the Inspector, the Colonel, and me staring at each other.\a147\a160\a145Pon my word, I am inclined to agree with Master Alec,\a148 said the official. \a147It may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to me that\a151\a148His words were cut short by a sudden scream of \a147Help. Help. Murder!. With a thrill I recognized the voice of that of my friend. I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. The cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room which we had first visited. I dashed in, and on into the dressing-room beyond. The two Cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists. In an instant the three of us had torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very pale and evidently greatly exhausted.\a147Arrest these men, Inspector,\a148 he gasped.\a147On what charge?\a148\a147That of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan.\a148The Inspector stared about him in bewilderment. \a147Oh, come now, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he at last, \a147I\a146m sure you don\a146t really mean to\a151\a148\a147Tut, man, look at their faces!\a148 cried Holmes, curtly.Never certainly have I seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances. The older man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door, he blew his whistle. Two of his constables came at the call.\a147I have no alternative, Mr. Cunningham,\a148 said he. \a147I trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake, but you can see that\a151 Ah, would you? Drop it!\a148 He struck out with his hand, and a revolver which the younger man was in the act of cocking clattered down upon the floor.\a147Keep that,\a148 said Holmes, quietly putting his foot upon it; \a147you will find it useful at the trial. But this is what we really wanted\a148. He held up a little crumpled piece of paper.\a147The remainder of the sheet!\a148 cried the Inspector.\a147Precisely.\a148\a147And where was it?\a148\a147Where I was sure it must be. I\a146ll make the whole matter clear to you presently. I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. The Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time.\a148Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o\a146clock he rejoined us in the Colonel\a146s smoking-room. He was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.\a147I wished Mr. Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small matter to you,\a148 said Holmes, \a147for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 answered the Colonel, warmly, \a147I consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.\a148\a147I am afraid that my explanation may disillusion you but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength had been rather tried of late.\a148\a147I trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks.\a148Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. \a147We will come to that in its turn,\a148 said he. \a147I will lay an account of the case before you in its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in my decision. Pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you.\a147It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out of a number of facts, which are incidental and which vital. Otherwise your energy and attention must be dissipated instead of being concentrated. Now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in the dead man\a146s hand.\a147Before going into this, I would draw your attention to the fact that, if Alec Cunningham\a146s narrative was correct, and if the assailant, after shooting William Kirwan, had \iinstantly\i fled, then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the dead man\a146s hand. But if it was not he, it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the time that the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the investigation, I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.\a147And now I made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the Inspector had submitted to us. It was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. Here it is. Do you not now observed something very suggestive about it?\a148\a147It has a very irregular look,\a148 said the Colonel.\a147My dear sir,\a148 cried Holmes, \a147there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words. When I draw your attention to the strong t\a146s of \a145at\a146 and \a145to\a146, and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of \a145quarter\a146 and \a145twelve,\a146 you will instantly recognize the fact. A very brief analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the \a145learn\a146 and the \a145maybe\a146 are written in the stronger hand, and the \a145what\a146 in the weaker.\a148\a147By Jove, it\a146s as clear as day!\a148 cried the Colonel. \a147Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?\a148\a147Obviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each should have an equal hand in it. Now, of the two men, it is clear that the one who wrote the \a145at\a146 and \a145to\a146 was the ringleader.\a148\a147How do you get at that?\a148\a147We might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other. But we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up. These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his \a145quarter\a146 in between the \a145at\a146 and the \a145to,\a146 showing that the latter were already written. The man who wrote all his words first in undoubtedly the man who planned the affair.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 cried Mr. Acton.\a147But very superficial,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We come now, however, to a point which is of importance. You may not be aware that the deduction of a man\a146s age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility although the t\a146s have begun to lose their crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 cried Mr. Acton again.\a147There is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest. There is something in common between these hands. They belong to men who are blood-relatives. It may be most obvious to you in the Greek e\a146s, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. There were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. They all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter.\a147Having got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into the details of the crime, and to see how far they would help us. I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw all that was to be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to determine with absolute confidence, fired from a revolver at the distance of something over four yards. There was no powder-blackening on the clothes. Evidently, therefore. Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired. Again, both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. At that point, however, as it happens, there is . broadish ditch, moist at the bottom. As there were no indications of bootmarks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon the scene at all.\a147And now I have to consider the motive of this singular crime. To get at this, I endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at Mr. Acton\a146s. I understood, from something which the Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been going on between you, Mr. Acton, and the Cunninghams. Of course, it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case.\a148\a147Precisely so,\a148 said Mr. Acton. \a147There can be no possible doubt as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate, and if they could have found a single paper\a151 which, fortunately, was in the strong-box of my solicitors\a151 they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.\a148\a147There you are,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147It was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man\a146s hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it. The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.\a147The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.\a147Good heavens!\a148 cried the Colonel, laughing, \a147do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?\a148\a147Speaking professionally, it was admirably done,\a148 cried I, looking in amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new phase of his astuteness.\a147It is an art which is often useful,\a148 said he. \a147When I recovered I managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word \a145twelve,\a146 so that I might compare it with the \a145twelve\a146 upon the paper.\a148\a147Oh, what an ass I have been!\a148 I exclaimed.\a147I could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I had hardly got the paper, however\a151 which was, as I had expected, in one of them\a151 when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man\a146s grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate.\a147I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else\a146s brains if he could have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton\a146s, and having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused.\a148\a147And the note?\a148 I asked.Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.\q="#rs_note2"\c\i\m="reig-2i.png"\i\q\c\a147It is very much the sort of thing that I expected,\a148 said he. \a147Of course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results shows that the trap was skilfully baited. I am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p\a146s and in the tails of the g\a146s. The absence of the i-dots in the old man\a146s writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow.\a148\p\X1\BThe Crooked Man\B\X1\c\i\m="croo-04.png"\i\cOne summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day\a146s work had been an exhausting one. My wife had already gone upstairs, and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired. I had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.I looked at the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This could not be a visitor at so late an hour. A patient, evidently, and possibly an all-night sitting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and opened the door. To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood upon my step.\a147Ah, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I hoped that I might not be too late to catch you.\a148\a147My dear fellow, pray come in.\a148\a147You look surprised, and no wonder. Relieved, too, I fancy. Hum. You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then. There\a146s no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat. It\a146s easy to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson. You\a146ll never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve. Could you put me up tonight?\a148\a147With pleasure.\a148\a147You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that you have no gentleman visitor at present. Your hat-stand proclaims as much.\a148\a147I shall be delighted if you will stay.\a148\a147Thank you. I\a146ll fill the vacant peg then. Sorry to see that you\a146ve had the British workman in the house. He\a146s a token of evil. Not the drains, I hope?\a148\a147No, the gas.\a148\a147Ah. He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. No, thank you, I had some supper at Waterloo, but I\a146ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.\a148I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in silence. I was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour, so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.\a147I see that you are professionally rather busy just now,\a148 said he, glancing very keenly across at me.\a147Yes, I\a146ve had a busy day,\a148 I answered. \a147It may seem very foolish in your eyes,\a148 I added, \a147but really I don\a146t know how you deduced it.\a148Holmes chuckled to himself.\a147I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,\a148 said he. \a147When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 I cried.\a147Elementary,\a148 said he. \a147It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. The same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader. Now, at present I am in the position of these same readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man\a146s brain, and yet I lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory. But I\a146ll have them, Watson, I\a146ll have them!. His eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant only. When I glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.\a147The problem presents features of interest,\a148 said he. \a147I may even say exceptional features of interest. I have already looked into the matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution. If you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me.\a148\a147I should be delighted.\a148\a147Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?\a148\a147I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice.\a148\a147Very good. I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo.\a148\a147That would give me time.\a148\a147Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what has happened, and of what remains to be done.\a148\a147I was sleepy before you came. I am quite wakeful now.\a148\a147I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case. It is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter. It is the supposed murder of Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Mallows, at Aldershot, which I am investigating.\a148\a147I have heard nothing of it.\a148\a147It has not excited much attention yet, except locally. The facts are only two days old. Briefly they are these:\a147The Royal Mallows is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish regiments in the British army. It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. It was commanded up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket.\a147Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of a former colour-sergeant in the same corps. There was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple (for they were still young) found themselves in their new surroundings. They appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his brother officers. I may add that she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.\a147Colonel Barclay\a146s family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay\a146s devotion to his wife was greater than his wife\a146s to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. But they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow.\a147Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character. He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. This side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times. As the major expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gayeties and chaff of the mess-table. For days on end, when the mood was on him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom. This and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his brother officers had observed. The latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark. This puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and conjecture.\a147The first battalion of the Royal Mallows (which is the old 117th) has been stationed at Aldershot for some years. The married officers live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north camp. The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the high-road. A coachman and two maids form the staff of servants. These with their master and mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.\a147Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of last Monday.\a148\a147Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off clothing. A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it. When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went off together to their meeting. It lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as she passed.\a147There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine. This faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the lawn. The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. It was into this room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return. The blinds were not down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual habits. The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room, but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the morning-room. The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it. He was never seen again alive.\a147The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside. Naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging. They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard, those of Barclay and of his wife. Barclay\a146s remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners. The lady\a146s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her voice could be plainly heard. \a145You coward!\a146 she repeated over and over again. \a145What can be done now. What can be done now. Give me back my life. I will never so much as breathe the same air with you again. You coward. You Coward!. Those were scraps of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man\a146s voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman. Convinced that some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it, while scream after scream issued from within. He was unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him. A sudden thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open. One side of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room. His mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.\a147Naturally, the coachman\a146s first thought, on finding that he could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. But here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. The key was not in the inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned. The lady, against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a state of insensibility. The Colonel\a146s body was then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy.\a147The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt weapon. Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have been. Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The Colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies. The servants deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked. Nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay\a146s person nor upon that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to be found. The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from Aldershot.\a147That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to supplement the efforts of the police. I think that you will acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more extraordinary than would at first sight appear.\a147Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated. One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the housemaid. You will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. On that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they had fallen out. On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word David uttered twice by the lady. The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. The Colonel\a146s name, you remember, was James.\a147There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest impression both upon the servants and the police. This was the contortion of the Colonel\a146s face. It had set, according to their account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming. More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of course, fitted in well enough with the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him. Nor was the fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid the blow. No information could be got from the lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of brain-fever.\a147From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of what it was which had caused the ill-humour in which her companion had returned.\a148\a147Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which were merely incidental. There could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door-key. A most careful search had failed to discover it in the room. Therefore it must have been taken from it. But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel\a146s wife could have taken it. That was perfectly clear. Therefore a third person must have entered the room. And that third person could only have come in through the window. It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. You know my methods, Watson. There was not one of them which I did not apply to the inquiry. And it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road. I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his foot-marks\a151 one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered. He had apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper than his heels. But it was not the man who surprised me. It was his companion.\a148\a147His companion!\a148Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee.\a147What do you make of that?\a148 he asked.The paper was covered with he tracings of the foot-marks of some small animal. It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as a dessert-spoon.\a147It\a146s a dog,\a148 said I.\a147Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain. I found distinct traces that this creature had done so.\a148\a147A monkey, then?\a148\a147But it is not the print of a monkey.\a148\a147What can it be, then?\a148\a147Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar with. I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements. Here are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless. You see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not much less than two feet long\a151 probably more if there is any tail. But now observe this other measurement. The animal has been moving, and we have the length of its stride. In each case it is only about three inches. You have an indication, you see, of a long body with very short legs attached to it. It has not been considerate enough to leave any of its hair behind it. But its general shape must be what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is carnivorous.\a148\a147How do you deduce that?\a148\a147Because it ran up the curtain. A canary\a146s cage was hanging in the window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird.\a148\a147Then what was the beast?\a148\a147Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving the case. On the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel and stoat tribe\a151 and yet it is larger than any of these that I have seen.\a148\a147But what had it to do with the crime?\a148\a147That, also, is still obscure. But we have learned a good deal, you perceive. We know that a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel between the Barclays\a151 the blinds were up and the room lighted. We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of the fender. Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left.\a148\a147Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it was before,\a148 said I.\a147Quite so. They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper than was at first conjectured. I thought the matter over, and I came to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow.\a148\a147Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop.\a148\a147It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left the house at half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband. She was never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly fashion. Now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally, on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o\a146clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him. But Miss Morrison had been with her during the whole of that hour and a half. It was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her denial, that she must know something of the matter.\a147My first conjecture was, that possibly there had been some passages between this young lady and the old soldier, which the former had now confessed to the wife. That would account for the angry return, and also for the girl\a146s denial that anything had occurred. Nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overhead. But there was the reference to David, and there was the known affection of the Colonel for his wife, to weigh against it, to say nothing of the tragic intrusion of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with what had gone before. It was not easy to pick one\a146s steps, but, on the whole, I was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been anything between the Colonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever convinced that the young lady held the clue as to what it was which had turned Mrs. Barclay to hatred of her husband. I took the obvious course, therefore, of calling upon Miss M., of explaining to her that I was perfectly certain that she held the facts in her possession, and of assuring her that her friend, Mrs. Barclay, might find herself in the dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were cleared up.\a147Miss Morrison is a little ethereal slip of a girl, with timid eyes and blond hair, but I found her by no means wanting in shrewdness and common-sense. She sat thinking for some time after I had spoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement which I will condense for your benefit.\a147\a160\a145I promised my friend that I would say nothing of the matter, and a promise is a promise,; said she; \a145but if I can really help her when so serious a charge is laid against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise. I will tell you exactly what happened upon Monday evening.\a147\a160\a145We were returning from the Watt Street Mission about a quarter to nine o\a146clock. On our way we had to pass through Hudson Street, which is a very quiet thoroughfare. There is only one lamp in it, upon the left-hand side, and as we approached this lamp I saw a man coming towards us with his back very bent, and something like a box slung over one of his shoulders. He appeared to be deformed, for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent. We were passing him when he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, \a147My God, it\a146s Nancy!. Mrs. Barclay turned as white as death, and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking creature not caught hold of her. I was going to call for the police, but she, to my surprise, spoke quite civilly to the fellow.\a145\a147I thought you had been dead this thirty years, Henry,\a148 said she, in a shaking voice.\a145\a147So I have,\a148 said he, and it was awful to hear the tones that he said it in. He had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams. His hair and whiskers were shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.\a145\a147Just walk on a little way, dear,\a148 said Mrs. Barclay; \a147I want to have a word with this man. There is nothing to be afraid of\a148. She tried to speak boldly, but she was still deadly pale and could hardly get her words out for the trembling of her lips.\a147\a160\a145I did as she asked me, and they talked together for a few minutes. Then she came down the street with her eyes blazing, and I saw the crippled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shaking his clenched fists in the air as if he were mad with rage. She never said a word until we were at the door here, when she took me by the hand and begged me to tell no one what had happened.\a145\a147It\a146s an old acquaintance of mine who has come down in the world,\a148 said she. When I promised her I would say nothing she kissed me, and I have never seen her since. I have told you now the whole truth, and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not realize then the danger in which my dear friend stood. I know that it can only be to her advantage that everything should be known.\a146\a147There was her statement, Watson, and to me, as you can imagine, it was like a light on a dark night. Everything which had been disconnected before began at once to assume its true place, and I had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events. My next step obviously was to find the man who had produced such a remarkable impression upon Mrs. Barclay. If he were still in Aldershot it should not be a very difficult matter. There are not such a very great number of civilians, and a deformed man was sure to have attracted attention. I spent a day in the search, and by evening\a151 this very evening, Watson\a151 I had run him down. The man\a146s name is Henry Wood, and he lives in lodgings in this same street in which the ladies met him. He has only been five days in the place. In the character of a registration-agent I had a most interesting gossip with his landlady. The man is by trade a conjurer and performer, going round the canteens after nightfall, and giving a little entertainment at each. He carries some creature about with him in that box; about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she had never seen an animal like it. He uses it in some of his tricks according to her account. So much the woman was able to tell me, and also that it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights she had heard him groaning and weeping in his bedroom. He was all right, as far as money went, but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin. She showed it to me, Watson, and it was an Indian rupee.\a147So now, my dear fellow, you see exactly how we stand and why it is I want you. It is perfectly plain that after the ladies parted from this man he followed them at a distance, that he saw the quarrel between husband and wife through the window, that he rushed in, and that the creature which he carried in his box got loose. That is all very certain. But he is the only person in this world who can tell us exactly what happened in that room.\a148\a147And you intend to ask him?\a148\a147Most certainly\a151 but in the presence of a witness.\a148\a147And I am the witness?\a148\a147If you will be so good. If he can clear the matter up, well and good. If he refuses, we have no alternative but to apply for a warrant.\a148\a147But how do you know he\a146ll be there when we return?\a148\a147You may be sure that I took some precautions. I have one of my Baker Street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr, go where he might. We shall find him in Hudson Street to-morrow, Watson, and meanwhile I should be the criminal myself if I kept you out of bed any longer.\a148It was midday when we found ourselves at the scene of the tragedy, and, under my companion\a146s guidance, we made our way at once to Hudson Street. In spite of his capacity for concealing his emotions, I could easily see that Holmes was in a state of suppressed excitement, while I was myself tingling with that half-sporting, half-intellectual pleasure which I invariably experienced when I associated myself with him in his investigations.\a147This is the street,\a148 said he, as we turned into a short thoroughfare lined with plain two-storied brick houses. \a147Ah, here is Simpson to report.\a148\a147He\a146s in all right, Mr. Holmes,\a148 cried a small street Arab, running up to us.\a147Good, Simpson!\a148 said Holmes, patting him on the head. \a147Come along, Watson. This is the house\a148. He sent in his card with a message that he had come on important business, and a moment later we were face to face with the man whom we had come to see. In spite of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire, and the little room was like an oven. The man sat all twisted and huddled in his chair in a way which gave an indescribably impression of deformity; but the face which he turned towards us, though worn and swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable for its beauty. He looked suspiciously at us now out of yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking or rising, he waved towards two chairs.\a147Mr. Henry Wood, late of India, I believe,\a148 said Holmes, affably. \a147I\a146ve come over this little matter of Colonel Barclay\a146s death.\a148\a147What should I know about that?\a148\a147That\a146s what I want to ascertain. You know, I suppose, that unless the matter is cleared up, Mrs. Barclay, who is an old friend of yours, will in all probability be tried for murder.\a148The man gave a violent start.\a147I don\a146t know who you are,\a148 he cried, \a147nor how you come to know what you do know, but will you swear that this is true that you tell me?\a148\a147Why, they are only waiting for her to come to her senses to arrest her.\a148\a147My God. Are you in the police yourself?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147What business is it of yours, then?\a148\a147It\a146s every man\a146s business to see justice done.\a148\a147You can take my word that she is innocent.\a148\a147Then you are guilty.\a148\a147No, I am not.\a148\a147Who killed Colonel James Barclay, then?\a148\a147It was a just providence that killed him. But, mind you this, that if I had knocked his brains out, as it was in my heart to do, he would have had no more than his due from my hands. If his own guilty conscience had not struck him down it is likely enough that I might have had his blood upon my soul. You want me to tell the story. Well, I don\a146t know why I shouldn\a146t, for there\a146s no cause for me to be ashamed of it.\a147It was in this way, sir. You see me now with my back like a camel and by ribs all awry, but there was a time when Corporal Henry Wood was the smartest man in the 117th foot. We were in India then, in cantonments, at a place we\a146ll call Bhurtee. Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment, ay, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips, was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the colour-sergeant. There were two men that loved her, and one that she loved, and you\a146ll smile when you look at this poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me.\a147Well, though I had her heart, her father was set upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I would have had her when the Mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country.\a147We were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of us with half a battery of artillery, a company of Sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. There were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage. About the second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question whether we could communicate with General Neill\a146s column, which was moving up country. It was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so I volunteered to go out and to warn General Neill of our danger. My offer was accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and who drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel lines. At ten o\a146clock the same night I started off upon my journey. There were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only one that I was thinking when I dropped over the wall that night.\a147My way ran down a dried-up watercourse, which we hoped would screen me from the enemy\a146s sentries; but as I crept round the corner of it I walked right into six of them, who were crouching down in the dark waiting for me. In an instant I was stunned with a blow and bound hand and foot. But the real blow was to my heart and not to my head, for as I came to and listened to as much as I could understand of their talk, I heard enough to tell me that my comrade, the very man who had arranged the way that I was to take, had betrayed me by means of a native servant into the hands of the enemy.\a147Well, there\a146s no need for me to dwell on that part of it. You know now what James Barclay was capable of. Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their retreat, and it was many a long year before ever I saw a white face again. I was tortured and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. You can see for yourselves the state in which I was left. Some of them that fled into Nepaul took me with them, and then afterwards I was up past Darjeeling. The hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and I became their slave for a time until I escaped; but instead of going south I had to go north, until I found myself among the Afghans. There I wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to the Punjaub, where I lived mostly among the natives and picked up a living by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to England or to make myself known to my old comrades. Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. They never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that they never should. I heard that Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was rising rapidly in the regiment, but even that did not make me speak.\a147But when one gets old one has a longing for home. For years I\a146ve been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of England. At last I determined to see them before I died. I saved enough to bring me across, and then I came here where the soldiers are, for I know their ways and how to amuse them and so earn enough to keep me.\a148\a147Your narrative is most interesting,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147I have already heard of your meeting with Mrs. Barclay, and your mutual recognition. You then, as I understand, followed her home and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth. Your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn and broke in upon them.\a148\a147I did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as I have never seen a man look before, and over he went with his head on the fender. But he was dead before he fell. I read death on his face as plain as I can read that text over the fire. The bare sight of me was like a bullet through his guilty heart.\a148\a147And then?\a148\a147Then Nancy fainted, and I caught up the key of the door from her hand, intending to unlock it and get help. But as I was doing it it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing might look black against me, and any way my secret would be out if I were taken. In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up the curtain. When I got him into his box, from which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could run.\a148\a147Who\a146s Teddy?\a148 asked Holmes.The man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of hutch in the corner. In an instant out there slipped a beautiful reddish-brown creature, thin and lithe, with the legs of a stoat, a long, thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes that ever I saw in an animal\a146s head.\a147It\a146s a mongoose,\a148 I cried.\a147Well, some call them that, and some call them ichneumon,\a148 said the man. \a147Snake-catcher is what I call them, and Teddy is amazing quick on cobras. I have one here without the fangs, and Teddy catches it every night to please the folk in the canteen.\a147Any other point, sir?\a148\a147Well, we may have to apply to you again if Mrs. Barclay should prove to be in serious trouble.\a148\a147In that case, of course, I\a146d come forward.\a148\a147But if not, there is no object in raking up this scandal against a dead man, foully as he has acted. You have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed. Ah, there goes Major Murphy on the other side of the street. Good-by, Wood. I want to learn if anything has happened since yesterday.\a148We were in time to overtake the major before he reached the corner.\a147Ah, Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147I suppose you have heard that all this fuss has come to nothing?\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147The inquest is just over. The medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy. You see it was quite a simple case after all.\a148\a147Oh, remarkably superficial,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147Come, Watson, I don\a146t think we shall be wanted in Aldershot any more.\a148\a147There\a146s one thing,\a148 said I, as we walked down to the station. \a147If the husband\a146s name was James, and the other was Henry, what was this talk about David?\a148\a147That one word, my dear Watson, should have told me the whole story had I been the ideal reasoner which you are so fond of depicting. It was evidently a term of reproach.\a148\a147Of reproach?\a148\a147Yes; David strayed a little occasionally, you know, and on one occasion in the same direction as Sergeant James Barclay. You remember the small affair of Uriah and Bathsheba. My biblical knowledge is a trifle rusty, I fear, but you will find the story in the first or second of Samuel.\a148\p\X1\BThe Resident Patient\B\X1\c\i\m="resi-02.png"\i\cIn glancing over the somewhat incoherent series of Memoirs with which I have endeavoured to illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have been struck by the difficulty which I have experienced in picking out examples which shall in every way answer my purpose. For in those cases in which Holmes has performed some \itour-de-force\i of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel justified in laying them before the public. On the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish. The small matter which I have chronicled under the heading of \a147A Study in Scarlet,\a148 and that other later one connected with the loss of the \iGloria Scott\i, may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charybdis which are forever threatening the historian. It may be that in the business of which I am now about to write the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series.I cannot be sure of the exact date, for some of my memoranda on the matter have been mislaid, but it must have been towards the end of the first year during which Holmes and I shared chambers in Baker Street. It was boisterous October weather, and we both remained indoors all day, I because I feared with my shaken health to face the keen autumn wind, while he was deep in some of those abstruse chemical investigations which absorbed him utterly as long as he was engaged upon them. Towards evening, however, the breaking of a test tube brought his research to a premature ending, and he sprang up from his chair with an explanation of impatience and a clouded brow.\a147A day\a146s work ruined, Watson,\a148 said he, striding across to the window. \a147Ha! the stars are out and the wind has fallen. What do you say to a ramble through London?\a148I was weary of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced. For three hours we strolled about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet Street and the Strand. His characteristic talk, with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled. It was ten o\a146clock before we reached Baker Street again. A brougham was waiting at our door.\a147Hum. A doctor\a146s\a151 general practitioner, I perceive,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Not been long in practice, but has had a good deal to do. Come to consult us, I fancy. Lucky we came back!\a148I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes\a146s methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamplight inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. The light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. With some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum.A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered. His age may not have been more than three or four and thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy hue told of a life which has sapped his strength and robbed him of his youth. His manner was nervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentleman, and the thin white hand which he laid on the mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather than of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and sombre\a151 a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of colour about his necktie.\a147Good-evening, doctor,\a148 said Holmes, cheerily. \a147I am glad to see that you have only been waiting a very few minutes.\a148\a147You spoke to my coachman, then?\a148\a147No, it was the candle on the side-table that told me. Pray resume your seat and let me know how I can serve you.\a148\a147My name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,\a148 said our visitor, \a147and I live at 403 Brook Street.\a148\a147Are you not the author of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?\a148 I asked.His pale cheeks flushed with pleasure at hearing that his work was known to me.\a147I so seldom hear of the work that I thought it was quite dead,\a148 said he. \a147My publishers gave me a most discouraging account of its sale. You are yourself, I presume, a medical man?\a148\a147A retired army surgeon.\a148\a147My own hobby has always been nervous disease. I should wish to make it an absolute specialty, but, of course, a man must take what he can get at first. This, however, is beside the question, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate how valuable your time is. The fact is that a very singular train of events has occurred recently at my house in Brook Street, and to-night they came to such a head that I felt it was quite impossible for me to wait another hour before asking for your advice and assistance.\a148Sherlock Holmes sat down and lit his pipe. \a147You are very welcome to both,\a148 said he. \a147Pray let me have a detailed account of what the circumstances are which have disturbed you.\a148\a147One or two of them are so trivial,\a148 said Dr. Trevelyan, \a147that really I am almost ashamed to mention them. But the matter is so inexplicable, and the recent turn which it has taken is so elaborate, that I shall lay it all before you, and you shall judge what is essential and what is not.\a147I am compelled, to begin with, to say something of my own college career. I am a London University man, you know, and I am sure that your will not think that I am unduly singing my own praises if I say that my student career was considered by my professors to be a very promising one. After I had graduated I continued to devote myself to research, occupying a minor position in King\a146s College Hospital, and I was fortunate enough to excite considerable interest by my research into the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win the Bruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the monograph on nervous lesions to which your friend has just alluded. I should not go too far if I were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me.\a147But the one great stumbling-block lay in my want of capital. As you will readily understand, a specialist who aims high is compelled to start in one of a dozen streets in the Cavendish Square quarter, all of which entail enormous rents and furnishing expenses. Besides this preliminary outlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse. To do this was quite beyond my power, and I could only hope that by economy I might in ten years\a146 time save enough to enable me to put up my plate. Suddenly, however, an unexpected incident opened up quite a new prospect to me.\a147This was a visit from a gentleman of the name of Blessington, who was a complete stranger to me. He came up to my room one morning, and plunged into business in an instant.\a147\a160\a145You are the same Percy Trevelyan who has had so distinguished a career and won a great prize lately?\a146 said he.\a147I bowed.\a147\a160\a145Answer me frankly,\a146 he continued, \a145for you will find it to your interest to do so. You have all the cleverness which makes a successful man. Have you the tact?\a146\a147I could not help smiling at the abruptness of the question.\a147\a160\a145I trust that I have my share,\a146 I said.\a147\a160\a145Any bad habits. Not drawn towards drink, eh?\a146\a147\a160\a145Really, sir!\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Quite right. That\a146s all right. But I was bound to ask. With all these qualities, why are you not in practice?\a146\a147I shrugged my shoulders.\a147\a160\a145Come, come!\a146 said he, in his bustling way. \a145It\a146s the old story. More in your brains than in your pocket, eh. What would you say if I were to start you in Brook Street?\a146\a147I stared at him in astonishment.\a147\a160\a145Oh, it\a146s for my sake, not for yours,\a146 he cried. \a145I\a146ll be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you it will suit me very well. I have a few thousands to invest, d\a146ye see, and I think I\a146ll sink them in you.\a146\a147\a160\a145But why?\a146 I gasped.\a147\a160\a145Well, it\a146s just like any other speculation, and safer than most.\a146\a147\a160\a145What am I to do , then?\a146\a147\a160\a145I\a146ll tell you. I\a146ll take the house, furnish it, pay the maids, and run the whole place. All you have to do is just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room. I\a146ll let you have pocket-money and everything. Then you hand over to me three quarters of what you earn, and you keep the other quarter for yourself.\a146\a147This was the strange proposal, Mr. Holmes, with which the man Blessington approached me. I won\a146t weary you with the account of how we bargained and negotiated. It ended in my moving into the house next Lady-day, and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested. He came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient. His heart was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. He turned the two best rooms of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself. He was a man of singular habits, shunning company and very seldom going out. His life was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity itself. Every evening, at the same hour, he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put down five and three-pence for every guinea that I had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong-box in his own room.\a147I may say with confidence that he never had occasion to regret his speculation. From the first it was a success. A few good cases and the reputation which I had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front, and during the last few years I have made him a rich man.\a147So much, Mr. Holmes, for my past history and my relations with Mr. Blessington. It only remains for me now to tell you what has occurred to bring me here to-night.\a147Some weeks ago Mr. Blessington came down to me in, as it seemed to me, a state of considerable agitation. He spoke of some burglary which, he said, had been committed in the West End, and he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessarily excited about it, declaring that a day should not pass before we should add stronger bolts to our windows and doors. For a week he continued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short walk which had usually been the prelude to his dinner. From his manner it struck me that he was in mortal dread of something or somebody, but when I questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that I was compelled to drop the subject. Gradually, as time passed, his fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now lies.\a147What happened was this. Two days ago I received the letter which I now read to you. Neither address nor date is attached to it.\a147\a160\a145A Russian nobleman who is now resident in England,\a146 it runs, \a145would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of Dr. Percy Trevelyan. He has been for some years a victim to cataleptic attacks, on which, as is well known, Dr. Trevelyan is an authority. He proposes to call at about quarter past six to-morrow evening, if Dr. Trevelyan will make it convenient to be at home.\a146\a147This letter interest me deeply, because the chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy is the rareness of the disease. You may believe, then, that I was in my consulting-room when, at the appointed hour, the page showed in the patient.He was an elderly man, thin, demure, and common-place\a151 by no means the conception one forms of a Russian nobleman. I was much more struck by the appearance of his companion. This was a tall young man, surprisingly handsome, with a dark, fierce face, and the limbs and chest of a Hercules. He had his hand under the other\a146s arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance.\a147\a160\a145You will excuse my coming in, doctor,\a146 said he to me, speaking English with a slight lisp. \a145This is my father, and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming importance to me.\a146\a147I was touched by this filial anxiety. \a145You would, perhaps, care to remain during the consultation?\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Not for the world,\a146 he cried with a gesture of horror. \a145It is more painful to me than I can express. If I were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures I am convinced that I should never survive it. My own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive one. With your permission, I will remain in the waiting-room while you go into my father\a146s case.\a146\a147To this, of course, I assented, and the young man withdrew. The patient and I then plunged into a discussion of his case, of which I took exhaustive notes. He was not remarkable for intelligence, and his answers were frequently obscure, which I attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language. Suddenly, however, as I sat writing, he ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries, and on my turning towards him I was shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair, staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face. He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady.\a147My first feeling, as I have just said, was one of pity and horror. My second, I fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction. I made notes of my patient\a146s pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions, which harmonized with my former experiences. I had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in his chair, I ran down to get it. There was some little delay in finding it\a151 five minutes, let us say\a151 and then I returned. Imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone.\a147Of course, my first act was to run into the waiting-room. The son had gone also. The hall door had been closed, but not shut. My page who admits patients is a new boy and by no means quick. He waits downstairs, and runs up to show patients out when I ring the consulting-room bell. He had heard nothing, and the affair remained a complete mystery. Mr. Blessington came in from his walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say anything to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth, I have got in the way of late of holding as little communication with him as possible.\a147Well, I never thought that I should see anything more of the Russian and his son, so you can imagine my amazement when, at the very same hour this evening, they both came marching into my consulting-room, just as they had done before.\a147\a160\a145I feel that I owe you a great many apologies for my abrupt departure yesterday, doctor,\a146 said my patient.\a147\a160\a145I confess that I was very much surprised at it,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Well, the fact is,\a146 he remarked, \a145that when I recover from these attacks my mind is always very clouded as to all that has gone before. I woke up in a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made my way out into the street in a sort of dazed way when you were absent.\a146\a147\a160\a145And I,\a146 said the son, \a145seeing my father pass the door of the waiting-room, naturally thought that the consultation had come to an end. It was not until we had reached home that I began to realize the true state of affairs.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said I, laughing, \a145there is no harm done except that you puzzled me terribly; so if you, sir, would kindly step into the waiting-room I shall be happy to continue our consultation which was brought to so abrupt an ending.\a146\a147\a160\a145For half an hour or so I discussed that old gentleman\a146s symptoms with him, and then, having prescribed for him, I saw him go off upon the arm of his son.\a147I have told you that Mr. Blessington generally chose this hour of the day for his exercise. He came in shortly afterwards and passed upstairs. An instant later I heard him running down, and he burst into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic.\a147\a160\a145Who has been in my room?\a146 he cried.\a147\a160\a145No one,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145It\a146s a lie! He yelled. \a145Come up and look!\a146\a147I passed over the grossness of his language, as he seemed half out of his mind with fear. When I went upstairs with him he pointed to several footprints upon the light carpet.\a147\a160\a145D\a146you mean to say those are mine?\a146 he cried.\a147They were certainly very much larger than any which he could have made, and were evidently quite fresh. It rained hard this afternoon, as you know, and my patients were the only people who called. It must have been the case, then, that the man in the waiting-room had, for some unknown reason, while I was busy with the other, ascended to the room of my resident patient. Nothing has been touched or taken, but there were the footprints to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.\a147Mr. Blessington seemed more excited over the matter than I should have thought possible, though of course it was enough to disturb anybody\a146s peace of mind. He actually sat crying in an arm-chair, and I could hardly get him to speak coherently. It was his suggestion that I should come round to you, and of course I at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very singular one, though he appears to completely overtake its importance. If you would only come back with me in my brougham, you would at least be able to soothe him, though I can hardly hope that you will be able to explain this remarkable occurrence.\a148Sherlock Holmes had listened to this long narrative with an intentness which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused. His face was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled up more thickly from his pipe to emphasize each curious episode in the doctor\a146s tale. As our visitor concluded, Holmes sprang up without a word, handed me my hat, picked his own from the table, and followed Dr. Trevelyan to the door. Within a quarter of an hour we had been dropped at the door of the physician\a146s residence in Brook Street, one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one associates with a West-End practice. A small page admitted us, and we began at once to ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair.But a singular interruption brought us to a standstill. The light at the top was suddenly whisked out, and from the darkness came a reedy, quivering voice.\a147I have a pistol,\a148 it cried. \a147I give you my word that I\a146ll fire if you come any nearer.\a148\a147This really grows outrageous, Mr. Blessington,\a148 cried Dr. Trevelyan.\a147Oh, then it is you, doctor,\a148 said the voice, with a great heave of relief. \a147But those other gentlemen, are they what they pretend to be?\a148We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness.\a147Yes, yes, it\a146s all right,\a148 said the voice at last. \a147You can come up, and I am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you.\a148He relit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw before us a singular-looking man, whose appearance, as well as his voice, testified to his jangled nerves. He was very fat, but had apparently at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of a blood-hound. He was of a sickly colour, and his thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. In his hand he held a pistol, but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced.\a147Good-evening, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147I am sure I am very much obliged to you for coming round. No one ever needed your advice more than I do. I suppose that Dr. Trevelyan has told you of this most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Who are these two men Mr. Blessington, and why do they wish to molest you?\a148\a147Well, well,\a148 said the resident patient, in a nervous fashion, \a147of course it is hard to say that. You can hardly expect me to answer that, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Do you mean that you don\a146t know?\a148\a147Come in here, if you please. Just have the kindness to step in here.\a148He led the way into his bedroom, which was large and comfortably furnished.\a147You see that,\a148 said he, pointing to a big black box at the end of his bed. \a147I have never been a very rich man, Mr. Holmes\a151 never made but one investment in my life, as Dr. Trevelyan would tell you. But I don\a146t believe in bankers. I would never trust a banker, Mr. Holmes. Between ourselves, what little I have is in that box, so you can understand what it means to me when unknown people force themselves into my rooms.\a148Holmes looked at Blessington in his questioning way and shook his head.\a147I cannot possibly advise you if you try to deceive me,\a148 said he.\a147But I have told you everything.\a148Holmes turned on his heel with a gesture of disgust. \a147Good-night, Dr. Trevelyan,\a148 said he.\a147And no advice for me?\a148 cried Blessington, in a breaking voice.\a147My advice to your, sir, is to speak the truth.\a148A minute later we were in the street and walking for home. We had crossed Oxford Street and were half way down Harley Street before I could get a word from my companion.\a147Sorry to bring you out on such a fool\a146s errand, Watson,\a148 he said at last. \a147It is an interesting case, too, at the bottom of it.\a148\a147I can make little of it,\a148 I confessed.\a147Well, it is quite evident that there are two men\a151 more, perhaps, but at least two\a151 who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow Blessington. I have no doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to Blessington\a146s room, while his confederate, by an ingenious device, kept the doctor from interfering.\a148\a147And the catalepsy?\a148\a147A fraudulent imitation, Watson, though I should hardly dare to hint as much to our specialist. It is a very easy complaint to imitate. I have done it myself.\a148\a147And then?\a148\a147By the purest chance Blessington was out on each occasion. Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room. It just happened, however, that this hour coincided with Blessington\a146s constitutional, which seems to show that they were not very well acquainted with his daily routine. Of course, if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it. Besides, I can read in a man\a146s eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for. It is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it. I hold it, therefore, to be certain that he does know who these men are, and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it. It is just possible that to-morrow may find him in a more communicative mood.\a148\a147Is there not one alternative,\a148 I suggested, \a147grotesquely improbably, no doubt, but still just conceivable. Might the whole story of the cataleptic Russian and his son be a concoction of Dr. Trevelyan\a146s, who has, for his own purposes, been in Blessington\a146s rooms?\a148I saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine.\a147My dear fellow,\a148 said he, \a147it was one of the first solutions which occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate the doctor\a146s tale. This young man has left prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room. When I tell you that his shoes were square-toed instead of being pointed like Blessington\a146s, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor\a146s, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for I shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street in the morning.\a148Sherlock Holmes\a146s prophecy was soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic fashion. At half-past seven next morning, in the first glimmer of daylight, I found him standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown.\a147There\a146s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,\a148 said he.\a147What\a146s the matter, then?\a148\a147The Brook Street business.\a148\a147Any fresh news?\a148\a147Tragic, but ambiguous,\a148 said he, pulling up the blind. \a147Look at this\a151 a sheet from a note-book, with \a145For God\a146s sake come at once\a151 P. T.,\a146 scrawled upon it in pencil. Our friend, the doctor, was hard put to it when he wrote this. Come along, my dear fellow, for it\a146s an urgent call.\a148In a quarter of an hour or so we were back at the physician\a146s house. He came running out to meet us with a face of horror.\a147Oh, such a business!\a148 he cried, with his hands to his temples.\a147What then?\a148\a147Blessington has committed suicide!\a148Holmes whistled.\a147Yes, he hanged himself during the night.\a148We had entered, and the doctor had preceded us into what was evidently his waiting-room.\a147I really hardly know what I am doing,\a148 he cried. \a147The police are already upstairs. It has shaken me most dreadfully.\a148\a147When did you find it out?\a148\a147He has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning. When the maid entered, about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the middle of the room. He had tied his cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday.\a148Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.\a147With your permission,\a148 said he at last, \a147I should like to go upstairs and look into the matter.\a148We both ascended, followed by the doctor.It was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom door. I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man Blessington conveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance. The neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken\a146s, making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural by the contrast. He was clad only in his long night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded starkly from beneath it. Beside him stood a smart-looking police-inspector, who was taking notes in a pocket-book.\a147Ah, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, heartily, as my friend entered, \a147I am delighted to see you.\a148\a147Good-morning, Lanner,\a148 answered Holmes; \a147you won\a146t think me an intruder, I am sure. Have you heard of the events which led up to this affair?\a148\a147Yes, I heard something of them.\a148\a147Have you formed any opinion?\a148\a147As far as I can see, the man has been driven out of his senses by fright. The bed has been well slept in, you see. There\a146s his impression deep enough. It\a146s about five in the morning, you know, that suicides are most common. That would be about his time for hanging himself. It seems to have been a very deliberate affair.\a148\a147I should say that he has been dead about three hours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,\a148 said I.\a147Noticed anything peculiar about the room?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Found a screw-driver and some screws on the wash-hand stand. Seems to have smoked heavily during the night, too. Here are four cigar-ends that I picked out of the fireplace.\a148\a147Hum!\a148 said Holmes, \a147have you got his cigar-holder?\a148\a147No, I have seen none.\a148\a147His cigar-case, then?\a148\a147Yes, it was in his coat-pocket.\a148Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which it contained.\a147Oh, this is an Havana, and these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by the Dutch from their East Indian colonies. They are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are thinner for their length than any other brand\a148. He picked up the four ends and examined them with his pocket-lens.\a147Two of these have been smoked from a holder and two without,\a148 said he. \a147Two have been cut by a not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent teeth. This is no suicide, Mr. Lanner. It is a very deeply planned and cold-blooded murder.\a148\a147Impossible!\a148 cried the inspector.\a147And why?\a148\a147Why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?\a148\a147That is what we have to find out.\a148\a147How could they get in?\a148\a147Through the front door.\a148\a147It was barred in the morning.\a148\a147Then it was barred after them.\a148\a147How do you know?\a148\a147I saw their traces. Excuse me a moment, and I may be able to give you some further information about it.\a148He went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical way. Then he took out the key, which was on the inside, and inspected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the rope were each in turn examined, until at last he professed himself satisfied, and with my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object and laid it reverently under a sheet.\a147How about this rope?\a148 he asked.\a147It is cut off this,\a148 said Dr. Trevelyan, drawing a large coil from under the bed. \a147He was morbidly nervous of fire, and always kept this beside him, so that he might escape by the window in case the stairs were burning.\a148\a147That must have saved them trouble,\a148 said Holmes, thoughtfully. \a147Yes, the actual facts are very plain, and I shall be surprised if by the afternoon I cannot give you the reasons for them as well. I will take this photograph of Blessington, which I see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help me in my inquiries.\a148\a147But you have told us nothing!\a148 cried the doctor.\a147Oh, there can be no doubt as to the sequence of events,\a148 said Holmes. \a147There were three of them in it: the young man, the old man, and a third, to whose identity I have no clue. The first two, I need hardly remark, are the same who masqueraded as the Russian count and his son, so we can give a very full description of them. They were admitted by a confederate inside the house. If I might offer you a word of advice, Inspector, it would be to arrest the page, who, as I understand, has only recently come into your service, Doctor.\a148\a147The young imp cannot be found,\a148 said Dr. Trevelyan; \a147the maid and the cook have just been searching for him.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147He has played a not unimportant part in this drama,\a148 said he. \a147The three men having ascended the stairs, which they did on tiptoe, the elder man first, the younger man second, and the unknown man in the rear\a151\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Oh, there could be no question as to the superimposing of the footmarks. I had the advantage of learning which was which last night. They ascended, then, to Mr. Blessington\a146s room, the door of which they found to be locked. With the help of a wire, however, they forced round the key. Even without the lens you will perceive, by the scratches on this ward, where the pressure was applied.\a147On entering the room their first proceeding must have been to gag Mr. Blessington. He may have been asleep, or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. These walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his shriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard.\a147Having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of some sort was held. Probably it was something in the nature of a judicial proceeding. It must have lasted for some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoke. The older man sat in that wicker chair; it was he who used the cigar-holder. The younger man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. The third fellow paced up and down. Blessington, I think, sat upright in the bed, but of that I cannot be absolutely certain.\a147Well, it ended by their taking Blessington and hanging him. The matter was so prearranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows. That screw-driver and those screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up. Seeing the hook, however they naturally saved themselves the trouble. Having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate.\a148We had all listened with the deepest interest to this sketch of the night\a146s doings, which Holmes had deduced from signs so subtle and minute that, even when he had pointed them out to us, we could scarcely follow him in his reasoning. The inspector hurried away on the instant to make inquiries about the page, while Holmes and I returned to Baker Street for breakfast.\a147I\a146ll be back by three,\a148 said he, when we had finished our meal. \a147Both the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that hour, and I hope by that time to have cleared up any little obscurity which the case may still present.\a148Our visitors arrived at the appointed time, but it was a quarter to four before my friend put in an appearance. From his expression as he entered, however, I could see that all had gone well with him.\a147Any news, Inspector?\a148\a147We have got the boy, sir.\a148\a147Excellent, and I have got the men.\a148\a147You have got them!\a148 we cried, all three.\a147Well, at least I have got their identity. This so-called Blessington is, as I expected, well known at headquarters, and so are his assailants. Their names are Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat.\a148\a147The Worthingdon bank gang,\a148 cried the inspector.\a147Precisely,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Then Blessington must have been Sutton.\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Why, that makes it as clear as crystal,\a148 said the inspector.But Trevelyan and I looked at each other in bewilderment.\a147You must surely remember the great Worthingdon bank business,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Five men were in it\a151 these four and a fifth called Cartwright. Tobin, the care-taker, was murdered, and the thieves got away with seven thousand pounds. This was in 1875. They were all five arrested, but the evidence against them was by no means conclusive. This Blessington or Sutton, who was the worst of the gang, turned informer. On his evidence Cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece. When they got out the other day, which was some years before their full term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their comrade upon him. Twice they tried to get at him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. Is there anything further which I can explain, Dr. Trevelyan?\a148\a147I think you have made it all remarkable clear,\a148 said the doctor. \a147No doubt the day on which he was perturbed was the day when he had seen of their release in the newspapers.\a148\a147Quite so. His talk about a burglary was the merest blind.\a148\a147But why could he not tell you this?\a148\a147Well, my dear sir, knowing the vindictive character of his old associates, he was trying to hide his own identity from everybody as long as he could. His secret was a shameful one, and he could not bring himself to divulge it. However, wretch as he was, he was still living under the shield of British law, and I have no doubt, Inspector, that you will see that, though that shield may fail to guard, the sword of justice is still there to avenge.\a148Such were the singular circumstances in connection with the Resident Patient and the Brook Street Doctor. From that night nothing has been seen of the three murderers by the police, and it is surmised at Scotland Yard that they were among the passengers of the ill-fated steamer \iNorah Creina\i, which was lost some years ago with all hands upon the Portuguese coast, some leagues to the north of Oporto. The proceedings against the page broke down for want of evidence, and the Brook Street Mystery, as it was called, has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print.\p\X1\BThe Greek Interpreter\B\X1\c\i\m="gree-02.png"\i\cDuring my long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his own early life. This reticence upon his part had increased the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until sometimes I found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain without a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in intelligence. His aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his unemotional character, but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people. I had come to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he began to talk to me about his brother.It was after tea on a summer evening, and the conversation, which had roamed in a desultory, spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came round at last to the question of atavism and hereditary aptitudes. The point under discussion was, how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his ancestry and how far to his own early training.\a147In your own case,\a148 said I, \a147from all that you have told me, it seems obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar facility for deduction are due to your own systematic training.\a148\a147To some extent,\a148 he answered, thoughtfully. \a147My ancestors were country squires, who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class. But, none the less, my turn that way is in my veins, and may have come with my grandmother, who was the sister of Vernet, the French artist. Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.\a148\a147But how do you know that it is hereditary?\a148\a147Because my brother Mycroft possesses it in a larger degree than I do.\a148This was news to me indeed. If there were another man with such singular powers in England, how was it that neither police nor public had heard of him. I put the question, with a hint that it was my companion\a146s modesty which made him acknowledge his brother as his superior. Holmes laughed at my suggestion.\a147My dear Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I cannot agree with those who rank modesty among the virtues. To the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are, and to underestimate one\a146s self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one\a146s own powers. When I say, therefore, that Mycroft has better powers of observation than I, you may take it that I am speaking the exact and literal truth.\a148\a147Is he your junior?\a148\a147Seven years my senior.\a148\a147How comes it that he is unknown?\a148\a147Oh, he is very well known in his own circle.\a148\a147Where, then?\a148\a147Well, in the Diogenes Club, for example.\a148I had never heard of the institution, and my face must have proclaimed as much, for Sherlock Holmes pulled out his watch.\a147The Diogenes Club is the queerest club in London, and Mycroft one of the queerest men. He\a146s always there from quarter to five to twenty to eight. It\a146s six now, so if you care for a stroll this beautiful evening I shall be very happy to introduce you to two curiosities.\a148\a147Five minutes later we were in the street, walking towards Regent\a146s Circus.\a147You wonder,\a148 said my companion, \a147why it is that Mycroft does not use his powers for detective work. He is incapable of it.\a148\a147But I thought you said\a151\a148\a147I said that he was my superior in observation and deduction. If the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm-chair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived. But he has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solution, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury.\a148\a147It is not his profession, then?\a148\a147By no means. What is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante. He has an extraordinary faculty for figures, and audits the books in some of the government departments. Mycroft lodges in Pall Mall, and he walks round the corner into Whitehall every morning and back every evening. From year\a146s end to year\a146s end he takes no other exercise, and is seen nowhere else, except only in the Diogenes Club, which is just opposite his rooms.\a148\a147I cannot recall the name.\a148\a147Very likely not. There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubable men in town. No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. Save in the Stranger\a146s Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.\a148We had reached Pall Mall as we talked, and were walking down it from the St. James\a146s end. Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not to speak, he led the way into the hall. Through the glass panelling I caught a glimpse of a large and luxurious room, in which a considerable number of men were sitting about and reading papers, each in his own little nook. Holmes showed me into a small chamber which looked out into Pall Mall, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion whom I knew could only be his brother.Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter man than Sherlock. His body was absolutely corpulent, but is face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother. His eyes, which were of a peculiarly light, watery gray, seemed to always retain that far-away, introspective look which I had only observed in Sherlock\a146s when he was exerting his full powers.\a147I am glad to meet you, sir,\a148 said he, putting out a broad, fat hand like the flipper of a seal. \a147I hear of Sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler. By the way, Sherlock, I expected to see you round last week, to consult me over that Manor House case. I thought you might be a little out of your depth.\a148\a147No, I solved it,\a148 said my friend, smiling.\a147It was Adams, of course.\a148\a147Yes, it was Adams.\a148\a147I was sure of it from the first\a148. The two sat down together in the bow-window of the club. \a147To any one who wishes to study mankind this is the spot,\a148 said Mycroft. \a147Look at the magnificent types. Look at these two men who are coming towards us, for example.\a148\a147The billiard-marker and the other?\a148\a147Precisely. What do you make of the other?\a148The two men had stopped opposite the window. Some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which I could see in one of them. The other was a very small, dark fellow, with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm.\a147An old soldier, I perceive,\a148 said Sherlock.\a147And very recently discharged,\a148 remarked the brother.\a147Served in India, I see.\a148\a147And a non-commissioned officer.\a148\a147Royal Artillery, I fancy,\a148 said Sherlock.\a147And a widower.\a148\a147But with a child.\a148\a147Children, my dear boy, children.\a148\a147Come,\a148 said I, laughing, \a147this is a little too much.\a148\a147Surely,\a148 answered Holmes, \a147it is not hard to say that a man with that bearing, expression of authority, and sunbaked skin, is a soldier, is more than a private, and is not long from India.\a148\a147That he has not left the service long is shown by his still wearing is ammunition boots, as they are called,\a148 observed Mycroft.\a147He had not the cavalry stride, yet he wore his hat on one side, as is shown by the lighter skin of that side of his brow. His weight is against his being a sapper. He is in the artillery.\a148\a147Then, of course, his complete mourning shows that he has lost some one very dear. The fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as though it were his wife. He has been buying things for children, you perceive. There is a rattle, which shows that one of them is very young. The wife probably died in childbed. The fact that he has a picture-book under his arm shows that there is another child to be thought of.\a148I began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener faculties that he did himself. He glanced across at me and smiled. Mycroft took snuff from a tortoise-shell box, and brushed away the wandering grains from his coat front with a large, red silk handkerchief.\a147By the way, Sherlock,\a148 said he, \a147I have had something quite after your own heart\a151 a most singular problem\a151 submitted to my judgment. I really had not the energy to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion, but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation. If you would care to hear the facts\a151\a148\a147My dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.\a148The brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his pocket-book, and, ringing the bell, he handed it to the waiter.\a147I have asked Mr. Melas to step across,\a148 said he. \a147He lodges on the floor above me, and I have some slight acquaintance with him, which led him to come to me in his perplexity. Mr. Melas is a Greek by extraction, as I understand, and he is a remarkable linguist. He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels. I think I will leave him to tell his very remarkable experience in his own fashion.\a148A few minutes later we were joined by a short, stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech was that of an educated Englishman. He shook hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was anxious to hear his story.\a147I do not believe that the police credit me\a151 on my word, I do not,\a148 said he in a wailing voice. \a147Just because they have never heard of it before, they think that such a thing cannot be. But I know that I shall never be easy in my mind until I know what has become of my poor man with the sticking-plaster upon his face.\a148\a147I am all attention,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes.\a147This is Wednesday evening,\a148 said Mr. Melas. \a147Well then, it was Monday night\a151 only two days ago, you understand\a151 that all this happened. I am an interpreter, as perhaps my neighbour there has told you. I interpret all languages\a151 or nearly all\a151 but as I am a Greek by birth and with a Grecian name, it is with that particular tongue that I am principally associated. For many years I have been the chief Greek interpreter in London, and my name is very well known in the hotels.It happens not unfrequently that I am sent for at strange hours by foreigners who get into difficulties, or by travelers who arrive late and wish my services. I was not surprised, therefore, on Monday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a cab which was waiting at the door. A Greek friend had come to see him upon business, he said, and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue, the services of an interpreter were indispensable. He gave me to understand that his house was some little distance off, in Kensington, and he seemed to be in a great hurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we had descended to the street.\a147I say into the cab, but I soon became doubtful as to whether it was not a carriage in which I found myself. It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London, and the fittings, though frayed, were of rich quality. Mr. Latimer seated himself opposite to me and we started off through Charing Cross and up the Shaftesbury Avenue. We had come out upon Oxford Street and I had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to Kensington, when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my companion.\a147He began by drawing a most formidable-looking bludgeon loaded with lead from his pocket, and switching it backward and forward several times, as if to test its weight and strength. Then he placed it without a word upon the seat beside him. Having done this, he drew up the windows on each side, and I found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing through them.\a147\a160\a145I am sorry to cut off your view, Mr. Melas,\a146 said he. \a145The fact is that I have no intention that you should see what the place is to which we are driving. It might possibly be inconvenient to me if you could find your way there again.\a146\a147As you can imagine, I was utterly taken aback by such an address. My companion was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart from the weapon, I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.\a147\a160\a145This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. Latimer,\a146 I stammered. \a145You must be aware that what you are doing is quite illegal.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,\a146 said he, \a145but we\a146ll make it up to you. I must warn you, however, Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is against my interests, you will find it a very serious thing. I beg you to remember that no one knows where you are, and that, whether you are in this carriage or in my house, you are equally in my power.\a146\a147His words were quiet, but he had a rasping way of saying them which was very menacing. I sat in silence wondering what on earth could be his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary fashion. Whatever it might be, it was perfectly clear that there was no possible use in my resisting, and that I could only wait to see what might befall.\a147For nearly two hours we drove without my having the least clue as to where we were going. Sometimes the rattle of the stones told of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent course suggested asphalt; but, save by this variation in sound, there was nothing at all which could in the remotest way help me to form a guess as to where we were. The paper over each window was impenetrable to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front. It was a quarter-past seven when we left Pall Mall, and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill. My companion let down the window, and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with a lamp burning above it. As I was hurried from the carriage it swung open, and I found myself inside the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees on each side of me as I entered. Whether these were private grounds, however, or \ibona-fide\i country was more than I could possibly venture to say.\a147There was a coloured gas-lamp inside which was turned so low that I could see little save that the hall was of some size and hung with pictures. In the dim light I could make out that the person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking, middle-aged man with rounded shoulders. As he turned towards us the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses.\a147\a160\a145Is this Mr. Melas, Harold?\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well done, well done. No ill-will, Mr. Melas, I hope, but we could not get on without you. If you deal fair with us you\a146ll not regret it, but if you try any tricks, God help you!. He spoke in a nervous, jerky fashion, and with little giggling laughs in between, but somehow he impressed me with fear more than the other.\a147\a160\a145What do you want with me?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Only to ask a few questions of a Greek gentleman who is visiting us, and to let us have the answers. But say no more than you are told to say, or\a151\a146 here came the nervous giggle again\a151\a145you had better never have been born.\a146\a147As he spoke he opened a door and showed the way into a room which appeared to be very richly furnished, but again the only light was afforded by a single lamp half-turned down. The chamber was certainly large, and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it told me of its richness. I caught glimpses of velvet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and what seemed to be a suit of Japanese armour at one side of it. There was a chair just under the lamp, and the elderly man motioned that I should sit in it. The younger had left us, but he suddenly returned through another door, leading with him a gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us. As he came into the circle of dim light which enables me to see him more clearly I was thrilled with horror at his appearance. He was deadly pale and terribly emaciated, with the protruding, brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength. But what shocked me more than any signs of physical weakness was that his face was grotesquely criss-crossed with sticking-plaster, and that one large pad of it was fastened over his mouth.\a147\a160\a145Have you the slate, Harold?\a146 cried the older man, as this strange being fell rather than sat down into a chair. \a145Are his hands loose. Now, then, give him the pencil. You are to ask the questions, Mr. Melas, and he will write the answers. Ask him first of all whether he is prepared to sign the papers?\a146\a147The man\a146s eyes flashed fire.\a147\a160\a145Never!\a146 he wrote in Greek upon the slate.\a147\a160\a145On no condition?\a146 I asked, at the bidding of our tyrant.\a147\a160\a145Only if I see her married in my presence by a Greek priest whom I know.\a146\a147The man giggled in his venomous way.\a147\a160\a145You know what awaits you, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145I care nothing for myself.\a146\a147These are samples of the questions and answers which made up our strange half-spoken, half-written conversation. Again and again I had to ask him whether he would give in and sign the documents. Again and again I had the same indignant reply. But soon a happy thought came to me. I took to adding on little sentences of my own to each question, innocent ones at first, to test whether either of our companions knew anything of the matter, and then, as I found that they showed no signs I played a more dangerous game. Our conversation ran something like this:\a147\a160\a145You can do no good by this obstinacy. \iWho are you\i?\a146\a147\a160\a145I care not. \iI am a stranger in London\i.\a146\a147\a160\a145Your fate will be upon your own head. \iHow long have you been here?\i\a146\a147\a160\a145Let it be so. \iThree weeks\i.\a146\a147\a160\a145The property can never be yours. \iWhat ails you?\i\a146\a147\a160\a145It shall not go to villains. \iThey are starving me\i.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall go free if you sign. \iWhat house is this?\i\a146\a147\a160\a145I will never sign. \iI do not know\i.\a146\a147\a160\a145You are not doing her any service. \i What is your name?\i\a146\a147\a160\a145Let me hear her say so. \iKratides\i.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall see her if you sign. \iWhere are you from?\i\a146\a147\a160\a145Then I shall never see her. \iAthens\i.\a146\a147Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes, and I should have wormed out the whole story under their very noses. My very next question might have cleared the matter up, but at that instant the door opened and a woman stepped into the room. I could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and clad in some sort of loose white gown.\a147\a160\a145Harold,\a146 said she, speaking English with a broken accent. \a145I could not stay away longer. It is so lonely up there with only\a151 Oh, my God, it is Paul!\a146\a147These last words were in Greek, and at the same instant the man with a convulsive effort tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming out \a145Sophy. Sophy!\a146 rushed into the woman\a146s arms. Their embrace was but for an instant, however, for the younger man seized the woman and pushed her out of the room, while the elder easily overpowered his emaciated victim, and dragged him away through the other door. For a moment I was left alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with some vague idea that I might in some way get a clue to what this house was in which I found myself. Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for looking up I saw that the older man was standing in the door-way with his eyes fixed upon me.\a147\a160\a145That will do, Mr. Melas,\a146 said he. \a145You perceive that we have taken you into our confidence over some very private business. We should not have troubled you, only that our friend who speaks Greek and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the East. It was quite necessary for us to find some one to take his place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.\a146\a147I bowed.\a147\a160\a145There are five sovereigns here,\a146 said he, walking up to me, \a145which will, I hope, be a sufficient fee. But remember,\a146 he added, tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling, \a145if you speak to a human soul about this\a151 one human soul, mind\a151 well, may God have mercy upon your soul!\a148\a147I cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which this insignificant-looking man inspired me. I could see him better now as the lamp-light shone upon him. His features were peaky and sallow, and his little pointed beard was thready and ill-nourished. He pushed his face forward as he spoke and his lips and eyelids were continually twitching like a man with St. Vitus\a146s dance. I could not help thinking that his strange, catchy little laugh was also a symptom of some nervous malady. The terror of his face lay in his eyes, however, steel gray, and glistening coldly with a malignant, inexorable cruelty in their depths.\a147\a160\a145We shall know if you speak of this,\a146 said he. \a145We have our own means of information. Now you will find the carriage waiting, and my friend will see you on your way.\a146\a147I was hurried through the hall and into the vehicle, again obtaining that momentary glimpse of trees and a garden. Mr. Latimer followed closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a word. In silence we again drove for an interminable distance with the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled up.\a147\a160\a145You will get down here, Mr. Melas,\a146 said my companion. \a145I am sorry to leave you so far from your house, but there is no alternative. Any attempt upon your part to follow the carriage can only end in injury to yourself.\a146\a147He opened the door as he spoke, and I had hardly time to spring out when the coachman lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away. I looked around me in astonishment. I was on some sort of a heathy common mottled over with dark clumps of furze-bushes. Far away stretched a line of houses, with a light here and there in the upper windows. On the other side I saw the red signal-lamps of a railway.\a147The carriage which had brought me was already out of sight. I stood gazing round and wondering where on earth I might be, when I saw some one coming towards me in the darkness. As he came up to me I made out that he was a railway porter.\a147\a160\a145Can you tell me what place this is?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Wandsworth Common,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145Can I get a train into town?\a146\a147\a160\a145If you walk on a mile or so to Clapham Junction,\a146 said he, \a145you\a146ll just be in time for the last to Victoria.\a146\a147So that was the end of my adventure, Mr. Holmes. I do not know where I was, nor whom I spoke with, nor anything save what I have told you. But I know that there is foul play going on, and I want to help that unhappy man if I can. I told the whole story to Mr. Mycroft Holmes next morning, and subsequently to the police.\a148We all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock looked across at his brother.\a147Any steps?\a148 he asked.Mycroft picked up the \iDaily News\i, which was lying on the side-table.\a147\a160\a145Anybody supplying any information to the whereabouts of a Greek gentleman named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is unable to speak English, will be rewarded. A similar reward paid to any one giving information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. X 2473.. That was in all the dailies. No answer.\a148\a147How about the Greek Legation?\a148\a147I have inquired. They know nothing.\a148\a147A wire to the head of the Athens police, then?\a148\a147Sherlock has all the energy of the family,\a148 said Mycroft, turning to me. \a147Well, you take the case up by all means, and let me know if you do any good.\a148\a147Certainly,\a148 answered my friend, rising from his chair. \a147I\a146ll let you know, and Mr. Melas also. In the meantime, Mr. Melas, I should certainly be on my guard, if I were you, for of course they must know through these advertisements that you have betrayed them.\a148As we walked home together, Holmes stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several wires.\a147You see, Watson,\a148 he remarked, \a147our evening has been by no means wasted. Some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this way through Mycroft. The problem which we have just listened to, although it can admit of but one explanation, has still some distinguishing features.\a148\a147You have hopes of solving it?\a148\a147Well, knowing as much as we do, it will be singular indeed if we fail to discover the rest. You must yourself have formed some theory which will explain the facts to which we have listened.\a148\a147In a vague way, yes.\a148\a147What was your idea, then?\a148\a147It seemed to me to be obvious that this Greek girl had been carried off by the young Englishman named Harold Latimer.\a148\a147Carried off from where?\a148\a147Athens, perhaps.\a148Sherlock Holmes shook his head. \a147This young man could not talk a word of Greek. The lady could talk English fairly well. Inference\a151 that she had been in England some little time, but he had not been in Greece.\a148\a147Well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to England, and that this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him.\a148\a147That is more probable.\a148\a147Then the brother\a151 for that, I fancy, must be the relationship\a151 comes over from Greece to interfere. He imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate. They seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl\a146s fortune\a151 of which he may be trustee\a151 to them. This he refuses to do. In order to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr. Melas, having used some other one before. The girl is not told of the arrival of her brother, and finds it out by the merest accident.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147I really fancy that you are not far from the truth. You see that we hold all the cards, and we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part. If they give us time we must have them.\a148\a147But how can we find where this house lies?\a148\a147Well, if our conjecture is correct and the girl\a146s name is or was Sophy Kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her. That must be our main hope, for the brother is, of course, a complete stranger. It is clear that some time has elapsed since this Harold established these relations with the girl\a151 some weeks, at any rate\a151 since the brother in Greece has had time to hear of it and come across. If they have been living in the same place during this time, it is probable that we shall have some answer to Mycroft\a146s advertisement.\a148We had reached our house in Baker Street while we had been talking. Holmes ascended the stair first, and as he opened the door of our room he gave a start of surprise. Looking over his shoulder, I was equally astonished. His brother Mycroft was sitting smoking in the arm-chair.\a147Come in, Sherlock. Come in, sir,\a148 said he blandly, smiling at our surprised faces. \a147You don\a146t expect such energy from me, do you, Sherlock. But somehow this case attracts me.\a148\a147How did you get here?\a148\a147I passed you in a hansom.\a148\a147There has been some new development?\a148\a147I had an answer to my advertisement.\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147Yes, it came within a few minutes of your leaving.\a148\a147And to what effect?\a148Mycroft Holmes took out a sheet of paper.\a147Here it is,\a148 said he, \a147written with a J pen on royal cream paper by a middle-aged man with a weak constitution. \a145Sir,\a146 he says, \a145in answer to your advertisement of to-day\a146s date, I beg to inform you that I know the young lady in question very well. If you should care to call upon me I could give you some particulars as to her painful history. She is living at present at The Myrtles, Beckenham. Yours faithfully, J. Davenport.\a146\a147He writes from Lower Brixton,\a148 said Mycroft Holmes. \a147Do you not think that we might drive to him now, Sherlock, and learn these particulars?\a148\a147My dear Mycroft, the brother\a146s life is more valuable than the sister\a146s story. I think we should call at Scotland Yard for Inspector Gregson, and go straight out to Beckenham. We know that a man is being done to death, and every hour may be vital.\a148\a147Better pick up Mr. Melas on our way,\a148 I suggested. \a147We may need an interpreter.\a148\a147Excellent,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147Send the boy for a four-wheeler, and we shall be off at once\a148. He opened the table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket. \a147Yes,\a148 said he, in answer to my glance; \a147I should say from what we have heard, that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang.\a148It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall, at the rooms of Mr. Melas. A gentleman had just called for him, and he was gone.\a147Can you tell me where?\a148 asked Mycroft Holmes.\a147I don\a146t know, sir,\a148 answered the woman who had opened the door; \a147I only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a carriage.\a148\a147Did the gentleman give a name?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147He wasn\a146t a tall, handsome, dark young man?\a148\a147Oh, no, sir. He was a little gentleman, with glasses, thin in the face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing al the time that he was talking.\a148\a147Come along!\a148 cried Sherlock Holmes, abruptly. \a147This grows serious,\a148 he observed, as we drove to Scotland Yard. \a147These men have got hold of Melas again. He is a man of no physical courage, as they are well aware from their experience the other night. This villain was able to terrorize him the instant that he got into his presence. No doubt they want his professional services, but, having used him, they may be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery.\a148Our hope was that, by taking train, we might get to Beckenham as soon or sooner than the carriage. On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house. It was a quarter to ten before we reached London Bridge, and half past before the four of us alighted on the Beckenham platform. A drive of half a mile brought us to The Myrtles\a151 a large, dark house standing back from the road in its own grounds. Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up the drive together.\a147The windows are all dark,\a148 remarked the inspector. \a147The house seems deserted.\a148\a147Our birds are flown and the nest empty,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Why do you say so?\a148\a147A carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the last hour.\a148The inspector laughed. \a147I saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?\a148\a147You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper\a151 so much so that we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on the carriage.\a148\a147You get a trifle beyond me there,\a148 said the inspector, shrugging his shoulder. \a147It will not be an easy door to force, but we will try if we cannot make some one hear us.\a148He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but without any success. Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few minutes.\a147I have a window open,\a148 said he.\a147It is a mercy that you are on the side of the force, and not against it, Mr. Holmes,\a148 remarked the inspector, as he noted the clever way in which my friend had forced back the catch. \a147Well, I think that under the circumstances we may enter without an invitation.\a148One after the other we made our way into a large apartment, which was evidently that in which Mr. Melas had found himself. The inspector had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see the two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them. On the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle, and the remains of a meal.\a147What is that?\a148 asked Holmes, suddenly.We all stood still and listened. A low moaning sound was coming from somewhere over our heads. Holmes rushed to the door and out into the hall. The dismal noise came from upstairs. He dashed up, the inspector and I at his heels, while his brother Mycroft followed as quickly as his great bulk would permit.Three doors faced up upon the second floor, and it was from the central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside. Holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in an instant, with his hand to his throat.\a148\a147It\a146s charcoal,\a148 he cried. \a147Give it time. It will clear.\a148Peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre. It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor, while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall. From the open door there reeked a horrible poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and coughing. Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he threw up the window and hurled the brazen tripod out into the garden.\a147We can enter in a minute,\a148 he gasped, darting out again. \a147Where is a candle. I doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere. Hold the light at the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft, now!\a148With a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out into the well-lit hall. Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. Indeed, so distorted were their features that, save for his black beard and stout figure, we might have failed to recognize in one of them the Greek interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours before at the Diogenes Club. His hands and feet were securely strapped together, and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow. The other, who was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage of emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque pattern over his face. He had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance showed me that for him at least our aid had come too late. Mr. Melas, however, still lived, and in less than an hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy I had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back from that dark valley in which all paths meet.It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions. His visitor, on entering his rooms, had drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped him for the second time. Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than the first, in which the two Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he did not comply with their demands. Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him.And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter, the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery. We were able to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy Grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in England. While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer, who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him. Her friends, shocked at the event, had contented themselves with informing her brother at Athens, and had then washed their hands of the matter. The brother, on his arrival in England, had imprudently placed himself in the power of Latimer and of his associate, whose name was Wilson Kemp\a151 that through his ignorance of the language he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeavoured by cruelty and starvation to make him sign away his own and his sister\a146s property. They had kept him in the house without the girl\a146s knowledge, and the plaster over the face had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse of him. Her feminine perception, however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion of the interpreter\a146s visit, she had seen him for the first time. The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators. Finding that their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours\a146 notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance both upon the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them.Months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from Buda-Pesth. It told how two Englishmen who had been travelling with a woman had met with a tragic end. They had each been stabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarrelled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other. Holmes, however, is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking, and holds to this day that, if one could find the Grecian girl, one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her brother came to be avenged.\p\X1\BThe Naval Treaty\B\X1\c\i\m="nava-03.png"\i\cThe July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the headings of \a147The Adventure of the Second Stain,\a148 \a147The Adventure of the Naval Treaty,\a148 and \a147The Adventure of the Tired Captain\a148. The first of these, however, deals with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issues. The new century will have come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile I pass on to the second on my list, which promised also at one time to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique character.During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finished his exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all little boys together we knew that his mother\a146s brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great conservative politician. This gaudy relationship did him little good at school. On the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence:Briarbrae, Woking. My dear Watson,\a151 I have no doubt that you can remember \a147Tadpole\a148 Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in the third. It is possible even that you may have heard that through my uncle\a146s influence I obtained a good appointment at the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation of trust and honour until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast my career.There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful event. In the event of your acceding to my request it is probably that I shall have to narrate them to you. I have only just recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you could bring your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me. I should like to have his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and as soon as possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live in this state of horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have not asked his advice sooner it was not because I did not appreciate his talents, but because I have been off my head ever since the blow fell. Now I am clear again, though I dare not think of it too much for fear of a relapse. I am still so weak that I have to write, as you see, by dictating. Do try to bring him.Your old school-fellow,Percy Phelps.There was something that touched me as I read this letter, something pitiable in the reiterated appeals to bring Holmes. So moved was I that even had it been a difficult matter I should have tried it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid as his client could be to receive it. My wife agreed with me that not a moment should be lost in laying the matter before him, and so within an hour of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in the old rooms in Baker Street.Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown, and working hard over a chemical investigation. A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an arm-chair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.\a147You come at a crisis, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147If this paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man\a146s life\a148. He dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson. \a147Hum. I thought as much!\a148 he cried. \a147I will be at your service in an instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the Persian slipper\a148. He turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw himself down into the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins.\a147A very commonplace little murder,\a148 said he. \a147You\a146ve got something better, I fancy. You are the stormy petrel of crime, Watson. What is it?\a148I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated attention.\a147It does not tell us very much, does it?\a148 he remarked, as he handed it back to me.\a147Hardly anything.\a148\a147And yet the writing is of interest.\a148\a147But the writing is not his own.\a148\a147Precisely. It is a woman\a146s.\a148\a147A man\a146s surely,\a148 I cried.\a147No, a woman\a146s, and a woman of rare character. You see, at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your client is in close contact with some one who, for good or evil, has an exceptional nature. My interest is already awakened in the case. If you are ready we will start at once for Woking, and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he dictates his letters.\a148We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large detached house standing in extensive grounds within a few minutes\a146 walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man who received us with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and his eyes so merry that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy.\a147I am so glad that you have come,\a148 said he, shaking our hands with effusion. \a147Percy has been inquiring for you all morning. Ah, poor old chap, he clings to any straw. His father and his mother asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very painful to them.\a148\a147We have had no details yet,\a148 observed Holmes. \a147I perceive that you are not yourself a member of the family.\a148Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he began to laugh.\a147Of course you saw the J H monogram on my locket,\a148 said he. \a147For a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie I shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed him hand-and-foot this two months back. Perhaps we\a146d better go in at once, for I know how impatient he is.\a148The chamber in which we were shown was on the same floor as the drawing-room. It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him, who rose as we entered.\a147Shall I leave, Percy?\a148 she asked.He clutched her hand to detain her. \a147How are you, Watson?\a148 said he, cordially. \a147I should never have known you under that moustache, and I dare say you would not be prepared to swear to me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. The stout young man had left us, but his sister still remained with her hand in that of the invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark, Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair. Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast.\a147I won\a146t waste your time,\a148 said he, raising himself upon the sofa. \a147I\a146ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. I was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life.\a147I was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and through the influences of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose rapidly to a responsible position. When my uncle became foreign minister in this administration he gave me several missions of trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and tact.\a147Nearly ten weeks ago\a151 to be more accurate, on the 23d of May\a151 he called me into his private room, and, after complimenting me on the good work which I had done, he informed me that he had a new commission of trust for me to execute.\a147\a160\a145This,\a146 said he, taking a gray roll of paper from his bureau, \a145is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the public press. It is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out. The French or the Russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. They should not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary to have them copied. You have a desk in your office?\a148\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then take the treaty and lock it up there. I shall give directions that you may remain behind when the others go, so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked. When you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in the desk, and hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.\a146\a147I took the papers and\a151\a148\a147Excuse me an instant,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Were you alone during this conversation?\a148\a147Absolutely.\a148\a147In a large room?\a148\a147Thirty feet each way.\a148\a147In the centre?\a148\a147Yes, about it.\a148\a147And speaking low?\a148\a147My uncle\a146s voice is always remarkably low. I hardly spoke at all.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes, shutting his eyes; \a147pray go on.\a148\a147I did exactly what he indicated, and waited until the other clerks had departed. One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my work, for I knew that Joseph\a151 the Mr. Harrison whom you saw just now\a151 was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the eleven-o\a146clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it.\a147When I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration in what he had said. Without going into details, I may say that it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple Alliance, and fore-shadowed the policy which this country would pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over it, and then settled down to my task of copying.\a147It was a long document, written in the French language, and containing twenty-six separate articles. I copied as quickly as I could, but at nine o\a146clock I had only done nine articles, and it seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day\a146s work. A cup of coffee would clear my brain. A commissionaire remains all night in a little lodge at the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working over time. I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.\a147To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron. She explained that she was the commissionaire\a146s wife, who did the charing, and I gave her the order for the coffee.\a147I wrote two more articles and then, feeling more drowsy than ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs. My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what was the cause of the delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to find out. There was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the commissionaire\a146s lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half way down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage running into it at right angles. This second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street. Here is a rough chart of the place.\a148\c\i\m="nava-i.png"\i\c\a147Thank you. I think that I quite follow you,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes.\a147It is of the utmost importance that you should notice this point. I went down the stairs and into the hall, where I found the commissionaire fast asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling furiously upon the spirit-lamp. I took off the kettle and blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting over the floor. Then I put out my hand and was about to shake the man, who was still sleeping soundly, when a bell over his head rang loudly, and he woke with a start.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Phelps, sir!\a146 said he, looking at me in bewilderment.\a147\a160\a145I came down to see if my coffee was ready.\a146\a147\a160\a145I was boiling the kettle when I fell asleep, sir\a148. He looked at me and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face.\a147\a160\a145If you was here, sir, then who rang the bell?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145The bell!\a146 I cried. \a145What bell is it?\a146\a147\a160\a145It\a146s the bell of the room you were working in.\a146\a147A cold hand seemed to close round my heart. Some one, then, was in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table. I ran frantically up the stair and along the passage. There was no one in the corridors, Mr. Holmes. There was no one in the room. All was exactly as I left it, save only that the papers which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay. The copy was there, and the original was gone.\a148Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed his hands. I could see that the problem was entirely to his heart. \a147Pray, what did you do then?\a148 he murmured.\a147I recognized in an instant that the thief must have come up the stairs from the side door. Of course I must have met him if he had come the other way.\a148\a147You were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the room all the time, or in the corridor which you have just described as dimly lighted?\a148\a147It is absolutely impossible. A rat could not conceal himself either in the room or the corridor. There is no cover at all.\a148\a147Thank you. Pray proceed.\a148\a147The commissionaire, seeing by my pale face that something was to be feared, had followed me upstairs. Now we both rushed along the corridor and down the steep steps which led to Charles Street. The door at the bottom was closed, but unlocked. We flung it open and rushed out. I can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chimes from a neighbouring clock. It was quarter to ten.\a148\a147That is of enormous importance,\a148 said Holmes, making a note upon his shirt-cuff.\a147The night was very dark, and a thin, warm rain was falling. There was no one in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going on, as usual, in Whitehall, at the extremity. We rushed along the pavement, bare-headed as we were, and at the far corner we found a policeman standing.\a147\a160\a145A robbery has been committed,\a146 I gasped. \a145A document of immense value has been stolen from the Foreign Office. Has any one passed this way?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have been standing here for a quarter of an hour, sir,\a146 said he; \a145only one person has passed during that time\a151 a woman, tall and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah, that is only my wife,\a146 cried the commissionaire; \a145has no one else passed?\a146\a147\a160\a145No one.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then it must be the other way that the thief took,\a146 cried the fellow, tugging at my sleeve.\a147\a160\a145But I was not satisfied, and the attempts which he made to draw me away increased my suspicions.\a147\a160\a145Which way did the woman go?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145I don\a146t know, sir. I noticed her pass, but I had no special reason for watching her. She seemed to be in a hurry.\a146\a147\a160\a145How long ago was it?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, not very many minutes.\a146\a147\a160\a145Within the last five?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, it could not be more than five.\a146\a147\a160\a145You\a146re only wasting your time, sir, and every minute now is of importance,\a146 cried the commissionaire; \a145take my word for it that my old woman has nothing to do with it, and come down to the other end of the street. Well, if you won\a146t, I will\a148. And with that he rushed off in the other direction.\a147But I was after him in an instant and caught him by the sleeve.\a147\a160\a145Where do you live?\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a14516 Ivy Lane, Brixton,\a146 he answered. \a145But don\a146t let yourself be drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps. Come to the other end of the street and let us see if we can hear of anything.\a146\a147Nothing was to be lost by following his advice. With the policeman we both hurried down, but only to find the street full of traffic, many people coming and going, but all only too eager to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night. There was no lounger who could tell us who had passed.\a147Then we returned to the office, and searched the stairs and the passage without result. The corridor which led to the room was laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an impression very easily. We examined it very carefully, but found no outline of any footmark.\a148\a147Had it been raining all evening?\a148\a147Since about seven.\a148\a147How is it, then, that the woman who came into the room about nine left no traces with her muddy boots?\a148\a147I am glad you raised the point. It occurred to me at the time. The charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the commissionaire\a146s office, and putting on list slippers.\a148\a147That is very clear. There were no marks, then, though the night was a wet one. The chain of events is certainly one of extraordinary interest. What did you do next?\a147We examined the room also. There is no possibility of a secret door, and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground. Both of them were fastened on the inside. The carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door, and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind. I will pledge my life that whoever stole my papers could only have come through the door.\a148\a147How about the fireplace?\a148\a147They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk. Whoever rang it must have come right up to the desk to do it. But why should any criminal wish to ring the bell. It is a most insoluble mystery.\a148\a147\a148Certainly the incident was unusual. What were your next steps. You examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder had left any traces\a151 any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other trifle?\a148\a147There was nothing of the sort.\a148\a147No smell?\a148\a147Well, we never thought of that.\a148\a147Ah, a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us in such an investigation.\a148\a147I never smoke myself, so I think I should have observed it if there had been any smell of tobacco. There was absolutely no clue of any kind. The only tangible fact was that the commissionaire\a146s wife-Mrs. Tangey was the name\a151 had hurried out of the place. He could give no explanation save that it was about the time when the woman always went home. The policeman and I agreed that our best plan would be to seize the woman before she could get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.\a147The alarm had reached Scotland Yard by this time, and Mr. Forbes, the detective, came round at once and took up the case with a great deal of energy. We hired a hansom, and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us. A young woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangey\a146s eldest daughter. Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown into the front room to wait.\a147About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. Instead of opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We heard her say, \a145Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to see you,\a146 and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down the passage. Forbes flung open the door, and we both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there before us. She stared at us with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly recognizing me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.\a147\a160\a145Why, if it isn\a146t Mr. Phelps, of the office!\a146 she cried.\a147\a160\a145Come, come, who did you think we were when you ran away from us?\a146 asked my companion.\a147\a160\a145I thought you were the brokers,\a146 said she, \a145we have had some trouble with a tradesman.\a146\a147\a160\a145That\a146s not quite good enough,\a146 answered Forbes. \a145We have reason to believe that you have taken a paper of importance fro the Foreign Office, and that you ran in here to dispose of it. You must come back with us to Scotland Yard to be searched.\a146\a147It was in vain that she protested and resisted. A four-wheeler was brought, and we all three drove back in it. We had first made an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the kitchen fire, to see whether she might have made away with the papers during the instant that she was alone. There were no signs, however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There were no signs of the papers.\a147Then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its full force. Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed thought. I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more to be done, and I had leisure to realize my position. It was horrible. Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle and of his colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon every one connected with me. What though I was the victim of an extraordinary accident. No allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was ruined, shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I don\a146t know what I did. I fancy I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection of a group of officials who crowded round me, endeavouring to soothe me. One of them drove down with me to Waterloo, and saw me into the Woking train. I believe that he would have come all the way had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives near me, was going down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.\a147You can imagine the state of things here when they were roused from their beds by the doctor\a146s ringing and found me in this condition. Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr. Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was in for a long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom, and it was turned into a sick-room for me. Here I have lain, Mr. Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain-fever. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor\a146s care I should not be speaking to you now. She has nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. Slowly my reason has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had. The first thing that I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the case in hand. He came out, and assures me that, though everything has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The commissionaire and his wife have been examined in every way without any light being thrown upon the matter. The suspicions of the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may remember, stayed over time in the office that night. His remaining behind and his French name were really the only two points which could suggest suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, I did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well as my position are forever forfeited.\a148The invalid sank back upon his cushions, tired out by this long recital, while his nurse poured him out a glass of some stimulating medicine. Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown back and his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem listless to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most intense self-absorption.\a147You statement has been so explicit,\a148 said he at last, \a147that you have really left me very few questions to ask. There is one of the very utmost importance, however. Did you tell any one that you had this special task to perform?\a148\a147No one.\a148\a147Not Miss Harrison here, for example?\a148\a147No. I had not been back to Woking between getting the order and executing the commission.\a148\a147And none of your people had by chance been to see you?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Did any of them know their way about in the office?\a148\a147Oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.\a148\a147Still, of course, if you said nothing to any one about the treaty these inquiries are irrelevant.\a148\a147I said nothing.\a148\a147Do you know anything of the commissionaire?\a148\a147Nothing except that he is an old soldier.\a148\a147What regiment?\a148\a147Oh, I have heard\a151 Coldstream Guards.\a148\a147Thank you. I have no doubt I can get details from Forbes. The authorities are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not always use them to advantage. What a lovely thing a rose is!\a148He walked past the couch to the open window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.\a147There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,\a148 said he, leaning with his back against the shutters. \a147It can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.Percy Phelps and his nurse looked at Holmes during this demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment written upon their faces. He had fallen into a reverie, with the moss-rose between his fingers. It had lasted some minutes before the young lady broke in upon it.\a147Do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?\a148 she asked, with a touch of asperity in her voice.\a147Oh, the mystery!\a148 he answered, coming back with a start to the realities of life. \a147Well, it would be absurd to deny that the case is a very abstruse and complicated one, but I can promise you that I will look into the matter and let you know any points which may strike me.\a148\a147Do you see any clue?\a148\a147You have furnished me with seven, but, of course, I must test them before I can pronounce upon their value.\a148\a147You suspect some one?\a148\a147I suspect myself.\a148\a147What!\a148\a147Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.\a148\a147Then go to London and test your conclusions.\a148\a147Your advice is very excellent, Miss Harrison,\a148 said Holmes, rising. \a147I think, Watson, we cannot do better. Do not allow yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps. The affair is a very tangled one.\a148\a147I shall be in a fever until I see you again,\a148 cried the diplomatist.\a147Well, I\a146ll come out be the same train to-morrow, though it\a146s more than likely that my report will be a negative one.\a148\a147God bless you for promising to come,\a148 cried our client. \a147It gives me fresh life to know that something is being done. By the way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.\a148\a147Ha. What did he say?\a148\a147He was cold, but not harsh. I dare say my severe illness prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken about my future\a151 by which he means, of course, my dismissal\a151 until my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.\a148\a147Well, that was reasonable and considerate,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Come, Watson, for we have a goody day\a146s work before us in town.\a148Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down to the station, and we were soon whirling up in a Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed Clapham Junction.\a147It\a146s a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses like this.\a148I thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself.\a147Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.\a148\a147The board-schools.\a148\a147Light-houses, my boy. Beacons of the future. Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wise, better England of the future. I suppose that man Phelps does not drink?\a148\a147I should not think so.\a148\a147Nor should I, but we are bound to take every possibility into account. The poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep water, and it\a146s a question whether we shall ever be able to get him ashore. What did you think of Miss Harrison?\a148\a147A girl of strong character.\a148\a147Yes, but she is a good sort, or I am mistaken. She and her brother are the only children of an iron-master somewhere up Northumberland way. He got engaged to her when travelling last winter, and she came down to be introduced to his people, with her brother as escort. Then came the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while brother Joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed on too. I\a146ve been making a few independent inquiries, you see. But to-day must be a day of inquiries.\a148\a147My practice\a151\a148 I began.\a147Oh, if you find your own cases more interesting than mine\a151\a148 said Holmes, with some asperity.\a147I was going to say that my practice could get along very well for a day or two, since it is the slackest time in the year.\a148\a147Excellent,\a148 said he, recovering his good-humour. \a147Then we\a146ll look into this matter together. I think that we should begin be seeing Forbes. He can probably tell us all the details we want until we know from what side the case is to be approached.\a147You said you had a clue?\a148\a147Well, we have several, but we can only test their value by further inquiry. The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless. Now this is not purposeless. Who is it who profits by it. There is the French ambassador, there is the Russian, there is who-ever might sell it to either of these, and there is Lord Holdhurst.\a148\a147Lord Holdhurst!\a148\a147Well, it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed.\a148\a147Not a statesman with the honourable record of Lord Holdhurst?\a148\a147It is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it. We shall see the noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us anything. Meanwhile I have already set inquiries on foot.\a148\a147Already?\a148\a147Yes, I sent wires from Woking station to every evening paper in London. This advertisement will appear in each of them.\a148He handed over a sheet torn from a note-book. On it was scribbled in pencil. \a147\a16310 reward. The number of the cab which dropped a fare at or about the door of the Foreign Office in Charles Street at quarter to ten in the evening of May 23d. Apply 221 B, Baker Street.\a148\a147You are confident that the thief came in a cab?\a148\a147If not, there is no harm done. But if Mr. Phelps is correct in stating that there is no hiding-place either in the room or the corridors, then the person must have come from outside. If he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes of his passing, then it is exceeding probably that he came in a cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.\a148\a147It sounds plausible.\a148\a147That is one of the clues of which I spoke. It may lead us to something. And then, of course, there is the bell\a151 which is the most distinctive feature of the case. Why should the bell ring. Was it the thief who did it out of bravado. Or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime. Or was it an accident. Or was it\a151?\a148 He sank back into the state of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged; but it seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him.It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us\a151 a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come.\a147I\a146ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, tartly. \a147You are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 said Holmes, \a147out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. I don\a146t blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me.\a148\a147I\a146d be very glad of a hint or two,\a148 said the detective, changing his manner. \a147I\a146ve certainly had no credit from the case so far.\a148\a147What steps have you taken?\a148\a147Tangey, the commissionaire, has been shadowed. He left the Guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him. His wife is a bad lot, though. I fancy she knows more about this than appears.\a148\a147Have you shadowed her?\a148\a147We have set one of our women on to her. Mrs. Tangey drinks, and our woman has been with her twice when she was well on, but she could get nothing out of her.\a148\a147I understand that they have had brokers in the house?\a148\a147Yes, but they were paid off.\a148\a147Where did the money come from?\a148\a147That was all right. His pension was due. They have not shown any sign of being in funds.\a148\a147What explanation did she give of having answered the bell when Mr. Phelps rang for the coffee?\a148\a147She said that he husband was very tired and she wished to relieve him.\a148\a147Well, certainly that would agree with his being found a little later asleep in his chair. There is nothing against them then but the woman\a146s character. Did you ask her why she hurried away that night. Her haste attracted the attention of the police constable.\a148\a147She was later than usual and wanted to get home.\a148\a147Did you point out to her that you and Mr. Phelps, who started at least twenty minutes after he, got home before her?\a148\a147She explains that by the difference between a \a146bus and a hansom.\a148\a147Did she make it clear why, on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?\a148\a147Because she had the money there with which to pay off the brokers.\a148\a147She has at least an answer for everything. Did you ask her whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about Charles Street?\a148\a147She saw no one but the constable.\a148\a147Well, you seem to have cross-examined her pretty thoroughly. What else have you done?\a148\a147The clerk Gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks, but without result. We can show nothing against him.\a148\a147Anything else?\a148\a147Well, we have nothing else to go upon\a151 no evidence of any kind.\a148\a147Have you formed a theory about how that bell rang?\a148\a147Well, I must confess that it beats me. It was a cool hand, whoever it was, to go and give the alarm like that.\a148\a147Yes, it was queer thing to do. Many thanks to you for what you have told me. If I can put the man into your hands you shall hear from me. Come along, Watson.\a148\a147Where are we going to now?\a148 I asked, as we left the office.\a147We are now going to interview Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet minister and future premier of England.\a148We were fortunate in finding that Lord Holdhurst was still in his chambers in Downing Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we were instantly shown up. The statesman received us with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us on the two luxuriant lounges on either side of the fireplace. Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his sharp features, thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely tinged with gray, he seemed to represent that not too common type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.\a147Your name is very familiar to me, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, smiling. \a147And, of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit. There has only been one occurrence in these offices which could call for your attention. In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?\a148\a147In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,\a148 answered Holmes.\a147Ah, my unfortunate nephew. You can understand that our kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way. I fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon his career.\a148\a147But if the document is found?\a148\a147Ah, that, of course, would be different.\a148\a147I had one or two questions which I wished to ask you, Lord Holdhurst.\a148\a147I shall be happy to give you any information in my power.\a148\a147Was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?\a148\a147It was.\a148\a147Then you could hardly have been overheard?\a148\a147It is out of the question.\a148\a147Did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147You are certain of that?\a148\a147Absolutely.\a148\a147Well, since you never said so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and nobody else knew anything of the matter, then the thief\a146s presence in the room was purely accidental. He saw his chance and he took it.\a148The statesman smiled. \a147You take me out of my province there,\a148 said he.Holmes considered for a moment. \a147There is another very important point which I wish to discuss with you,\a148 said he. \a147You feared, as I understand, that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known.\a148A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. \a147Very grave results indeed.\a148\a147Any have they occurred?\a148\a147Not yet.\a148\a147If the treaty had reached, let us say, the French or Russian Foreign Office, you would expect to hear of it?\a148\a147I should,\a148 said Lord Holdhurst, with a wry face.\a147Since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, then, and nothing has been heard, it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty has not reached them.\a148Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.\a147We can hardly suppose, Mr. Holmes, that the thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang it up.\a148\a147Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.\a148\a147If he waits a little longer he will get no price at all. The treaty will cease to be secret in a few months.\a148\a147That is most important,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Of course, it is a possible supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness\a151\a148\a147An attack of brain-fever, for example?\a148 asked the statesman, flashing a swift glance at him.\a147I did not say so,\a148 said Holmes, imperturbably. \a147And now, Lord Holdhurst, we have already taken up too much of your valuable time, and we shall wish you good-day.\a148\a147Every success to your investigation, be the criminal who it may,\a148 answered the nobleman, as he bowed us out the door.\a147He\a146s a fine fellow,\a148 said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall. \a147But he has a struggle to keep up his position. He is far from rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots had been resoled. Now, Watson, I won\a146t detain you from your legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day, unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement. But I should be extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to Woking to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday.\a148I met him accordingly next morning and we travelled down to Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant.We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered.\a147Any news?\a148 he asked, eagerly.\a147My report, as I expected, is a negative one,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I have seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have set one or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something.\a148\a147You have not lost heart, then?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147God bless you for saying that!\a148 cried Miss Harrison. \a147If we keep our courage and our patience the truth must come out.\a148\a147We have more to tell you than you have for us,\a148 said Phelps, reseating himself upon the couch.\a147I hoped you might have something.\a148\a147Yes, we have had an adventure during the night, and one which might have proved to be a serious one\a148. His expression grew very grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin to fear sprang up in his eyes. \a147Do you know,\a148 said he, \a147that I begin to believe that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as my honour?\a148\a147Ah!\a148 cried Holmes.\a147It sounds incredible, for I have not, as far as I know, an enemy in the world. Yet from last night\a146s experience I can come to no other conclusion.\a148\a147Pray let me hear it.\a148\a147You must know that last night was the very first night that I have ever slept without a nurse in the room. I was so much better that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a night-light burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into a light sleep when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the sounds were now. The first ones had been caused by some one forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed back.\a147There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me. Then I heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run.\a148\a147This is most interesting,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Pray what did you do then?\a148\a147I should have followed him through the open window if I had been stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen and the servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the groom found marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across the grass. There\a146s a place, however, on the wooden fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if some one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I thought I had best have your opinion first.\a148This tale of our client\a146s appeared to have an extraordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable excitement.\a147Misfortunes never come single,\a148 said Phelps, smiling, though it was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.\a147You have certainly had your share,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Do you think you could walk round the house with me?\a148\a147Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come, too.\a148\a147And I also,\a148 said Miss Harrison.\a147I am afraid not,\a148 said Holmes, shaking his head. \a147I think I must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.\a148The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her brother, however, had joined us and we set off all four together. We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist\a146s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stopped over them for an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.\a147I don\a146t think any one could make much of this,\a148 said he. \a147Let us go round the house and see why this particular room was chose by the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for him.\a148\a147They are more visible from the road,\a148 suggested Mr. Joseph Harrison.\a147Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have attempted. What is it for?\a148\a147It is the side entrance for trades-people. Of course it is locked at night.\a148\a147Have you ever had an alarm like this before?\a148\a147Never,\a148 said our client.\a147Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?\a148\a147Nothing of value.\a148Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets and a negligent air which was unusual with him.\a147By the way,\a148 said he to Joseph Harrison, \a147you found some place, I understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a look at that!\a148The plump young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.\a147Do you think that was done last night. It looks rather old, does it not?\a148\a147Well, possibly so.\a148\a147There are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side. No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the bedroom and talk the matter over.\a148Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others came up.\a147Miss Harrison,\a148 said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity of manner, \a147you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of the utmost importance.\a148\a147Certainly, if you wish it, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said the girl in astonishment.\a147When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and keep the key. Promise to do this.\a148\a147But Percy?\a148\a147He will come to London with us.\a148\a147And am I to remain here?\a148\a147It is for his sake. You can serve him. Quick. Promise!\a148She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two came up.\a147Why do you sit moping there, Annie?\a148 cried her brother. \a147Come out into the sunshine!\a148\a147No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing.\a148\a147What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?\a148 asked our client.\a147Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you would come up to London with us.\a148\a147At once?\a148\a147Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.\a148\a147I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.\a148\a147The greatest possible.\a148\a147Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?\a148\a147I was just going to propose it.\a148\a147Then, if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to look after me?\a148\a147Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he\a146ll look after you. We\a146ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town together.\a148It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes\a146s suggestion. What the object of my friend\a146s manoeuvres was I could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps, who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had still more startling surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking.\a147There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear up before I go,\a148 said he. \a147Your absence, Mr. Phelps, will in some ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is fortunate that you are old school-fellows, as you must have much to talk over. Mr. Phelps can have the spare bedroom to-night, and I will be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me into Waterloo at eight.\a148\a147But how about our investigation in London?\a148 asked Phelps, ruefully.\a147We can do that to-morrow. I think that just at present I can be of more immediate use here.\a148\a147You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back to-morrow night,\a148 cried Phelps, as we began to move from the platform.\a147I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,\a148 answered Holmes, and waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.\a147I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don\a146t believe it was an ordinary thief.\a148\a147What is your own idea, then?\a148\a147Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me, and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd, but consider the facts. Why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why should he come with a long knife in his hand?\a148\a147You are sure it was not a house-breaker\a146s jemmy?\a148\a147Oh, no, it was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly.\a148\a147But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?\a148\a147Ah, that is the question.\a148\a147Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his action, would it not. Presuming that your theory is correct, if he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you, while the other threatens your life.\a148\a147But Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.\a148\a147I have known him for some time,\a148 said I, \a147but I never knew him do anything yet without a very good reason,\a148 and with that our conversation drifted off on to other topics.But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his long illness, and his misfortune made him querulous and nervous. In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India, in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty, wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite painful.\a147You have implicit faith in Holmes?\a148 he asked.\a147I have seen him do some remarkable things.\a148\a147But he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this?\a148\a147Oh, yes; I have known him solve questions which presented fewer clues than yours.\a148\a147But not where such large interests are at stake?\a148\a147I don\a146t know that. To my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital matters.\a148\a147But you know him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite know what to make of him. Do you think he is hopeful. Do you think he expects to make a success of it?\a148\a147He has said nothing.\a148\a147That is a bad sign.\a148\a147On the contrary, I have noticed that when he is off the trail he generally says so. It is when he is on a scent and is not quite absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can\a146t help matters by making ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed and so be fresh for whatever may await us to-morrow.\a148I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice, though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much hope of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking. Why had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day. Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae that he intended to remain near them. I cudgelled my brains until I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which would cover all these facts.It was seven o\a146clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for Phelps\a146s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.\a147He\a146ll be here when he promised,\a148 said I, \a147and not an instant sooner or later.\a148And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the window we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but it was some little time before he came upstairs.\a147He looks like a beaten man,\a148 cried Phelps.I was forced to confess that he was right. \a147After all,\a148 said I, \a147the clue of the matter lies probably here in town.\a148Phelps gave a groan.\a147I don\a146t know how it is,\a148 said he, \a147but I had hoped for so much from his return. But surely his hand was not tied up like that yesterday. What can be the matter?\a148\a147You are not wounded, Holmes?\a148 I asked, as my friend entered the room.\a147Tut, it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness,\a148 he answered, nodding his good-mornings to us. \a147This case of yours, Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which I have ever investigated.\a148\a147I feared that you would find it beyond you.\a148\a147It has been a most remarkable experience.\a148\a147That bandage tells of adventures,\a148 said I. \a147Won\a146t you tell us what has happened?\a148\a147After breakfast, my dear Watson. Remember that I have breathed thirty miles of Surrey air this morning. I suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement. Well, well, we cannot expect to score every time.\a148The table was all laid, and just as I was about to ring Mrs. Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she brought in three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of depression.\a147Mrs. Hudson has risen to the occasion,\a148 said Holmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken. \a147Her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotch-woman. What have you here, Watson?\a148\a147Ham and eggs,\a148 I answered.\a147Good. What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps\a151 curried fowl or eggs, or will you help yourself?\a148\a147Thank you. I can eat nothing,\a148 said Phelps.\a147Oh, come. Try the dish before you.\a148\a147Thank you, I would really rather not.\a148\a147Well, then,\a148 said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle, \a147I suppose that you have no objection to helping me?\a148Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-gray paper. He caught it up, devoured it with his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, passing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back into an arm-chair so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting.\a147There! there!\a148 said Holmes, soothing, patting him upon the shoulder. \a147It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.\a148Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. \a147God bless you!\a148 he cried. \a147You have saved my honour.\a148\a147Well, my own was at stake, you know,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I assure you it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a commission.\a148Phelps thrust away the precious document into the innermost pocket of his coat.\a147I have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further, and yet I am dying to know how you got it and where it was.\a148Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of coffee, and turned his attention to the ham and eggs. Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down into his chair.\a147I\a146ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it afterwards,\a148 said he. \a147After leaving you at the station I went for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening, when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.\a147Well, I waited until the road was clear\a151 it is never a very frequented one at any time, I fancy\a151 and then I clambered over the fence into the grounds.\a148\a147Surely the gate was open!\a148 ejaculated Phelps.\a147Yes, but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the place where the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen I got over without the least chance of any one in the house being able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other side, and crawled from one to the other\a151 witness the disreputable state of my trouser knees\a151 until I had reached the clump of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I squatted down and awaited developments.\a147The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.\a147I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.\a148\a147The key!\a148 ejaculated Phelps.\a147Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her cooperation you would not have that paper in you coat-pocket. She departed then and the lights went out, and I was left squatting in the rhododendron-bush.\a147The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the water-course and waits for the big game. It was very long, though\a151 almost as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the Speckled Band. There was a church-clock down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than once that it had stopped. At last however about two in the morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servant\a146s door was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into the moonlight.\a148\a147Joseph!\a148 ejaculated Phelps.\a147He was bare-headed, but he had a black coat thrown over his shoulder so that he could conceal his face in an instant if there were any alarm. He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall, and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open the window, and putting his knife through the crack in the shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open.\a147From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the window.\a147Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for, has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to grasp him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had the upper hand of him. He looked murder out of the only eye he could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick enough to catch is bird, well and good. But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all the better for the government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for one, and Mr. Percy Phelps for another, would very much rather that the affair never got as far as a police-court.\a147My God!\a148 gasped our client. \a147Do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time?\a148\a147So it was.\a148\a147And Joseph. Joseph a villain and a thief!\a148\a147Hum. I am afraid Joseph\a146s character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow either his sister\a146s happiness or your reputation to hold his hand.\a148Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. \a147My head whirls,\a148 said he. \a147Your words have dazed me.\a148\a147The principal difficulty in your case,\a148 remarked Holmes, in his didactic fashion, \a147lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well, upon his way. When I heard that some one had been so anxious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have concealed anything\a151 you told us in your narrative how you had turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor\a151 my suspicions all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.\a148\a147How blind I have been!\a148\a147The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into your room the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his eyes caught the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy commissionaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were just enough to give the thief time to make his escape.\a147He made his way to Woking by the first train, and having examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value, he had concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying it to the French embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had. Then came your sudden return. He, without a moment\a146s warning, was bundled out of his room, and from that time onward there were always at least two of you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. The situation to him must have been a maddening one. But at last he thought he saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baffled by your wakefulness. You remember that you did not take your usual draught that night.\a148\a147I remember.\a148\a147I fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious. Of course, I understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be done with safety. Your leaving the room gave him the chance he wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it all day so that he might not anticipate us. Then, having given him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have described. I already knew that the papers were probably in the room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting in search of them. I let him take them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. Is there any other point which I can make clear?\a148\a147Why did he try the window on the first occasion,\a148 I asked, \a147when he might have entered by the door?\a148\a147In reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms. On the other hand, he could get out on to the lawn with ease. Anything else?\a148\a147You do not think,\a148 asked Phelps, \a147that he had any murderous intention. The knife was only meant as a tool.\a148\a147It may be so,\a148 answered Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \a147I can only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a gentleman to whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling to trust.\a148\p\X1\BThe Final Problem\B\X1\c\i\m="fina-01.png"\i\cIt is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the \a147Study in Scarlet,\a148 up to the time of his interference in the matter of the \a147Naval Treaty\a148\a151 and interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill. My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred. I alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when on good purpose is to be served by its suppression. As far as I know, there have been only three accounts in the public press: that in the \iJournal de Gen\a232ve\i on May 6th, 1891, the Reuter\a146s despatch in the English papers on May 7th, and finally the recent letter to which I have alluded. Of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the facts. It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified. He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his investigation, but these occasions grew more and more seldom, until I find that in the year 1890 there were only three cases of which I retain any record. During the winter of that year and the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the French government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and from Nimes, from which I gathered that his stay in France was likely to be a long one. It was with some surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of April 24th. It struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual.\a147Yes, I have been using myself up rather too freely,\a148 he remarked, in answer to my look rather than to my words; \a147I have been a little pressed of late. Have you any objection to my closing your shutters?\a148The only light in the room came from the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading. Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the shutters together, he bolted them securely.\a147You are afraid of something?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, I am.\a148\a147Of what?\a148\a147Of air-guns.\a148\a147My dear Holmes, what do you mean?\a148\a147I think that you know me well enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means a nervous man. At the same time, it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you. Might I trouble you for a match?\a148 He drew in the smoke of his cigarette as if the soothing influence was grateful to him.\a147I must apologize for calling so late,\a148 said he, \a147and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall.\a148\a147But what does it all mean?\a148 I asked.He held out his hand, and I saw in the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were burst and bleeding.\a147It is not an airy nothing, you see,\a148 said he, smiling. \a147On the contrary, it is solid enough for a man to break his hand over. Is Mrs. Watson in?\a148\a147She is away upon a visit.\a148\a147Indeed. You are alone?\a148\a147Quite.\a148\a147Then it makes it the easier for me to propose that you should come away with me for a week to the Continent.\a148\a147Where?\a148\a147Oh, anywhere. It\a146s all the same to me.\a148There was something very strange in all this. It was not Holmes\a146s nature to take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale, worn face told me that his nerves were at their highest tension. He saw the question in my eyes, and, putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon his knees, he explained the situation.\a147You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?\a148 said he.\a147Never.\a148\a147Aye, there\a146s the genius and the wonder of the thing!\a148 he cried. \a147The man pervades London, and no one has heard of him. That\a146s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. I tell you, Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia, and to the French republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.\a148\a147What has he done, then?\a148\a147His career has been an extraordinary one. He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a European vogue. On the strength of it he won the Mathematical Chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearance, a most brilliant career before him. But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. Dark rumours gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an army coach. So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you now is what I have myself discovered.\a147As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do. For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organizing power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts\a151 forgery cases, robberies, murders\a151 I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity.He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organized. Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed\a151 the word is passed to the Professor, the matter is organized and carried out. The agent may be caught. In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. But the central power which uses the agent is never caught\a151 never so much as suspected. This was the organization which I deduced, Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up.\a147But the Professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict in a court of law. You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal. My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill. But at last he made a trip\a151 only a little, little trip\a151 but it was more than he could afford when I was so close upon him. I had my chance, and, starting from that point, I have woven my net round him until now it is all ready to close. In three days\a151 that is to say, on Monday next\a151 matters will be ripe, and the Professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them; but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment.\a147Now, if I could have done this without the knowledge of Professor Moriarty, all would have been well. But he was too wily for that. He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him. Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him. This morning the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me.\a147My nerves are fairly proof, Watson, but I must confess to a start when I saw the very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing there on my threshold. His appearance was quite familiar to me. He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in this head. He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is forever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion. He peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes.\a147\a160\a145You have less frontal development that I should have expected,\a146 said he, at last. \a145It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one\a146s dressing-gown.\a146\a147The fact is that upon his entrance I had instantly recognized the extreme personal danger in which I lay. The only conceivable escape for him lay in silencing my tongue. In an instant I had slipped the revolver from the drawer into my pocket, and was covering him through the cloth. At his remark I drew the weapon out and laid it cocked upon the table. He still smiled and blinked, but there was something about his eyes which made me feel very glad that I had it there.\a147\a160\a145You evidently don\a146t know me,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145On the contrary,\a146 I answered, \a145I think it is fairly evident that I do. Pray take a chair. I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.\a146\a147\a160\a145All that I have to say has already crossed your mind,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145Then possibly my answer has crossed yours,\a146 I replied.\a147\a160\a145You stand fast?\a146\a147\a160\a145Absolutely.\a146\a147He clapped his hand into his pocket, and I raised the pistol from the table. But he merely drew out a memorandum-book in which he had scribbled some dates.\a147\a160\a145You crossed my patch on the 4th of January,\a146 said he. \a145On the 23rd you incommoded me; by the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced by you; at the end of March I was absolutely hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of April, I find myself placed in such a position through your continual persecution that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty. The situation is becoming an impossible one.\a146\a147\a160\a145Have you any suggestion to make?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145You must drop it, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, swaying his face about. \a145You really must, you know.\a146\a147\a160\a145After Monday,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Tut, tut,\a146 said he. \a145I am quite sure that a man of your intelligence will see that there can be but one outcome to this affair. It is necessary that you should withdraw. You have worked things in such a fashion that we have only one resource left. It has been an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which you have grappled with this affair, and I say, unaffectedly, that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take any extreme measure. You smile, sir, abut I assure you that it really would.\a146\a147\a160\a145Danger is part of my trade,\a146 I remarked.\a147\a160\a145That is not danger,\a146 said he. \a145It is inevitable destruction. You stand in the way not merely of an individual, but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which you, with all your cleverness, have been unable to realize. You must stand clear, Mr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.\a146\a147\a160\a145I am afraid,\a146 said I, rising, \a145that in the pleasure of this conversation I am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.\a146\a147He rose also and looked at me in silence, shaking his head sadly.\a147\a160\a145Well, well,\a146 said he, at last. \a145It seems a pity, but I have done what I could. I know every move of your game. You can do nothing before Monday. It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,\a146 said I. \a145Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.\a146\a147\a160\a145I can promise you the one, but not the other,\a146 he snarled, and so turned his rounded back upon me, and went peering and blinking out of the room.\a147That was my singular interview with Professor Moriarty. I confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind. His soft, precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which a mere bully could not produce. Of course, you will say. \a145Why not take police precautions against him?\a146 the reason is that I am well convinced that it is from his agents the blow will fall. I have the best proofs that it would be so.\a148\a147You have already been assaulted?\a148\a147My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. I went out about mid-day to transact some business in Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. The van dashed round by Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my feet. I called the police and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother\a146s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I dare say, working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.\a148I had often admired my friend\a146s courage, but never more than now, as he sat quietly checking off a series of incidents which must have combined to make up a day of horror.\a147You will spend the night here?\a148 I said.\a147No, my friend, you might find me a dangerous guest. I have my plans laid, and all will be well. Matters have gone so far now that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes, though my presence is necessary for a conviction. It is obvious, therefore, that I cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act. It would be a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come on to the Continent with me.\a148\a147The practice is quiet,\a148 said I, \a147and I have an accommodating neighbour. I should be glad to come.\a148\a147And to start to-morrow morning?\a148\a147If necessary.\a148\a147Oh yes, it is most necessary. Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in Europe. Now listen. You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night. In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the Lowther Arcade, handling the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past nine. You will find a small brougham waiting close to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red. Into this you will step, and you will reach Victoria in time for the Continental express.\a148\a147Where shall I meet you?\a148\a147At the station. The second first-class carriage from the front will be reserved for us.\a148\a147The carriage is our rendezvous, then?\a148\a147Yes.\a148It was in vain that I asked Holmes to remain for the evening. It was evident to me that he though he might bring trouble to the roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled him to go. With a few hurried words as to our plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads into Mortimer Street, and immediately whistling for a hansom, in which I heard him drive away.In the morning I obeyed Holmes\a146s injunctions to the letter. A hansom was procured with such precaution as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately after breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through which I hurried at the top of my speed. A brougham was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that I had stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled off to Victoria Station. On my alighting there he turned the carriage, and dashed away again without so much as a look in my direction.So far all had gone admirably. My luggage was waiting for me, and I had no difficulty in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the less so as it was the only one in the train which was marked \a147Engaged\a148. My only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. The station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. In vain I searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the little figure of my friend. There was no sign of him. I spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable Italian priest, who was endeavouring to make a porter understand, in his broken English, that his luggage was to be booked through to Paris. Then, having taken another look round, I returned to my carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend as a travelling companion. It was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my Italian was even more limited than his English, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. A chill of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when\a151\a147My dear Watson,\a148 said a voice, \a147you have not even condescended to say good-morning.\a148I turned in uncontrollable astonishment. The aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. The next the whole frame collapsed again, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he had come.\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried; \a147how you startled me!\a148\a147Every precaution is still necessary,\a148 he whispered. \a147I have reason to think that they are hot upon our trail. Ah, there is Moriarty himself.\a148The train had already begun to move as Holmes spoke. Glancing back, I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped. It was too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the station.\a147With all our precautions, you see that we have cut it rather fine,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. He rose, and throwing off the black cassock and hat which had formed his disguise, he packed them away in a hand-bag.\a147Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147You haven\a146t seen about Baker Street, then?\a148\a147Baker Street?\a148\a147They set fire to our rooms last night. No great harm was done.\a148\a147Good heavens, Holmes! this is intolerable.\a148\a147They must have lost my track completely after their bludgeon-man was arrested. Otherwise they could not have imagined that I had returned to my rooms. They have evidently taken the precaution of watching you, however, and that is what has brought Moriarty to Victoria. You could not have made any slip in coming?\a148\a147I did exactly what you advised.\a148\a147Did you find your brougham?\a148\a147Yes, it was waiting.\a148\a147Did you recognize your coachman?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147It was my brother Mycroft. It is an advantage to get about in such a case without taking a mercenary into your confidence. But we must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.\a148\a147As this is an express, and as the boat runs in connection with it, I should think we have shaken him off very effectively.\a148\a147My dear Watson, you evidently did not realize my meaning when I said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself. You do not imagine that if I were the pursuer I should allow myself to be baffled by so slight an obstacle. Why, then, should you think so meanly of him?\a148\a147What will he do?\a148\a147What I should do?\a148\a147What would you do, then?\a148\a147Engage a special.\a148\a147But it must be late.\a148\a147By no means. This train stops at Canterbury; and there is always at least a quarter of an hour\a146s delay at the boat. He will catch us there.\a148\a147One would think that we were the criminals. Let us have him arrested on his arrival.\a148\a147It would be to ruin the work of three months. We should get the big fish, but the smaller would dart right and left out of the net. On Monday we should have them all. No, an arrest is inadmissible.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147We shall get out at Canterbury.\a148\a147And then?\a148\a147Well, then we must make a cross-country journey to Newhaven, and so over to Dieppe. Moriarty will again do what I should do. He will get on to Paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days at the depot. In the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet-bags, encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel, and make our way at our leisure into Switzerland, via Luxembourg and Basle.\a148At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to Newhaven.I was still looking rather ruefully after the rapidly disappearing luggage-van which contained my wardrobe, when Holmes pulled my sleeve and pointed up the line.\a147Already, you see,\a148 said he.Far away, from among the Kentish woods there rose a thin spray of smoke. A minute later a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the open curve which leads to the station. We had hardly time to take our place behind a pile of luggage when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a blast of hot air into our faces.\a147There he goes,\a148 said Holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock over the point. \a147There are limits, you see, to our friend\a146s intelligence. It would have been a \icoup-de-ma\a238tre\i had he deduced what I would deduce and acted accordingly.\a148\a147And what would he have done had he overtaken us?\a148\a147There cannot be the least doubt that he would have made a murderous attack upon me. It is, however, a game at which two may play. The question, now is whether we should take a premature lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at Newhaven.\a148We made our way to Brussels that night and spent two days there, moving on upon the third day as far as Strasburg. On the Monday morning Holmes had telegraphed to the London police, and in the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our hotel. Holmes tore it open, and then with a bitter curse hurled it into the grate.\a147I might have known it!\a148 he groaned. \a147He has escaped!\a148\a147Moriarty?\a148\a147They have secured the whole gang with the exception of him. He has given them the slip. Of course, when I had left the country there was no one to cope with him. But I did think that I had put the game in their hands. I think that you had better return to England, Watson.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Because you will find me a dangerous companion now. This man\a146s occupation is gone. He is lost if he returns to London. If I read his character right he will devote his whole energies to revenging himself upon me. He said as much in our short interview, and I fancy that he meant it. I should certainly recommend you to return to your practice.\a148It was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend. We sat in the Strasburg \isalle-\a224-manger\i arguing the question for half an hour, but the same night we had resumed our journey and were well on our way to Geneva.For a charming week we wandered up the Valley of the Rhone, and then, branching off at Leuk, we made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep in snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meiringen. It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes forget the shadow which lay across him. In the homely Alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes, I could tell by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was well convinced that, walk where we would, we could not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging our footsteps.Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. In an instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the spring-time at that spot. He said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air of a man who sees the fulfilment of that which he had expected.And yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. On the contrary, I can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion.\a147I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain,\a148 he remarked. \a147If my record were closed to-night I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of London is the sweeter for my presence. In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side. Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible. Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in Europe.\a148I shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for me to tell. It is not a subject on which I would willingly dwell, and yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no detail.It was on the 3rd of May that we reached the little village of Meiringen, where we put up at the Englischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the elder. Our landlord was an intelligent man, and spoke excellent English, having served for three years as waiter at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. At his advice, on the afternoon of the 4th we set off together, with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui. We had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about half-way up the hill, without making a small detour to see them.It is indeed, a fearful place. The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. The shaft into which the river hurls itself is a immense chasm, lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep of green water roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. We stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss.The path has been cut half-way round the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveller has to return as he came. We had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. It bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left, and was addressed to me by the landlord. It appeared that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an English lady had arrived who was in the last stage of consumption. She had wintered at Davos Platz, and was journeying now to join her friends at Lucerne, when a sudden haemorrhage had overtaken her. It was thought that she could hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to her to see an English doctor, and, if I would only return, etc. The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself look upon my compliance as a very great favour, since the lady absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring a great responsibility.The appeal was one which could not be ignored. It was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. It was finally agreed, however, that he should retain the young Swiss messenger with him as guide and companion while I returned to Meiringen. My friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would then walk slowly over the hill to Rosenlaui, where I was to rejoin him in the evening. As I turned away I saw Holmes, with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of the waters. It was the last that I was ever destined to see of him in this world.When I was near the bottom of the descent I looked back. It was impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but I could see the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill and leads to it. Along this a man was, I remember, walking very rapidly.I could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green behind him. I noted him, and the energy with which he walked but he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand.It may have been a little over an hour before I reached Meiringen. Old Steiler was standing at the porch of his hotel.\a147Well,\a148 said I, as I came hurrying up, \a147I trust that she is no worse?\a148A look of surprise passed over his face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to lead in my breast.\a147You did not write this?\a148 I said, pulling the letter from my pocket. \a147There is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?\a148\a147Certainly not!\a148 he cried. \a147But it has the hotel mark upon it. Ha, it must have been written by that tall Englishman who came in after you had gone. He said\a151\a148But I waited for none of the landlord\a146s explanations. In a tingle of fear I was already running down the village street, and making for the path which I had so lately descended. It had taken me an hour to come down. For all my efforts two more had passed before I found myself at the fall of Reichenbach once more. There was Holmes\a146s Alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which I had left him. But there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that I shouted. My only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me.It was the sight of that Alpine-stock which turned me cold and sick. He had not gone to Rosenlaui, then. He had remained on that three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other, until his enemy had overtaken him. The young Swiss had gone too. He had probably been in the pay of Moriarty, and had left the two men together. And then what had happened. Who was to tell us what had happened then?I stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for I was dazed with the horror of the thing. Then I began to think of Holmes\a146s own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy. It was, alas, only too easy to do. During our conversation we had not gone to the end of the path, and the Alpine-stock marked the place where we had stood. The blackish soil is kept forever soft by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would leave its tread upon it. Two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the farther end of the path, both leading away from me. There were none returning. A few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the branches and ferns which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. I lay upon my face and peered over with the spray spouting up all around me. It had darkened since I left, and now I could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. I shouted; but only the same half-human cry of the fall was borne back to my ears.But it was destined that I should after all have a last word of greeting from my friend and comrade. I have said that his Alpine-stock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on to the path. From the top of this bowlder the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and, raising my hand, I found that it came from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. As I took it up a small square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered down on to the ground. Unfolding it, I found that it consisted of three pages torn from his note-book and addressed to me. It was characteristic of the man that the direction was a precise, and the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study.My dear Watson [it said], I write these few lines through the courtesy of Mr. Moriarty, who awaits my convenience for the final discussion of those questions which lie between us. He has been giving me a sketch of the methods by which he avoided the English police and kept himself informed of our movements. They certainly confirm the very high opinion which I had formed of his abilities. I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free society from any further effects of his presence, though I fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends, and especially, my dear Watson, to you. I have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I was quite convinced that the letter from Meiringen was a hoax, and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow. Tell Inspector Patterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are in pigeonhole M., done up in a blue envelope and inscribed \a147Moriarty\a148. I made every disposition of my property before leaving England, and handed it to my brother Mycroft. Pray give my greetings to Mrs. Watson, and believe me to be, my dear fellow,Very sincerely yours,Sherlock HolmesA few words may suffice to tell the little that remains. An examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other\a146s arms. Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. The Swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom Moriarty kept in this employ. As to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which Holmes had accumulated exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighted upon them. Of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if I have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom I shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known.\p\c\l\B\X0The Hound Of The Baskervilles\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\l\p\i\m="houn-53.png"\i\c\p\BChapter 1\B - \X1\BMr. Sherlock Holmes\B\X1Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a \a147Penang lawyer.\a148 Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. \a147To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,\a148 was engraved upon it, with the date \a1471884.\a148 It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry\a151 dignified, solid, and reassuring.\a147Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\a148Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.\a147How did you know what I was doing. I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.\a148\a147I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,\a148 said he. \a147But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor\a146s stick. Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.\a148\a147I think,\a148 said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, \a147that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.\a148\a147Good!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Excellent!\a148\a147I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\a148\a147Why so?\a148\a147Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.\a148\a147Perfectly sound!\a148 said Holmes.\a147And then again, there is the \a145friends of the C.C.H.\a146 I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return.\a148\a147Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\a148 said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. \a147I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.\a148He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.\a147Interesting, though elementary,\a148 said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. \a147There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.\a148\a147Has anything escaped me?\a148 I asked with some self-importance. \a147I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\a148\a147I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\a148\a147Then I was right.\a148\a147To that extent.\a148\a147But that was all.\a148\a147No, no, my dear Watson, not all\a151 by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials \a145C.C.\a146 are placed before that hospital the words \a145Charing Cross\a146 very naturally suggest themselves.\a148\a147You may be right.\a148\a147The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor.\a148\a147Well, then, supposing that \a145C.C.H.\a146 does stand for \a145Charing Cross Hospital,\a146 what further inferences may we draw?\a148\a147Do none suggest themselves. You know my methods. Apply them!\a148\a147I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.\a148\a147I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made. When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will. Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?\a148\a147It certainly seems probable.\a148\a147Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the \istaff\i of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he, then. If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician\a151 little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago\a151 the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.\a148I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\a147As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\a148 said I, \a147but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man\a146s age and professional career.\a148 From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.\c\i\a147Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon. House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled \a145Is Disease a Reversion?\a146 Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of \a145Some Freaks of Atavism\a146 (Lancet 1882). \a145Do We Progress?\a146 (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\a148\i\c\a147No mention of that local hunt, Watson,\a148 said Holmes with a mischievous smile, \a147but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\a148\a147And the dog?\a148\a147Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog\a146s jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been\a151 yes, by Jove, it \iis\i a curly-haired spaniel.\a148He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.\a147My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\a148\a147For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don\a146t move, I beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime. Come in!\a148The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes\a146s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. \a147I am so very glad,\a148 said he. \a147I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.\a148\a147A presentation, I see,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147From Charing Cross Hospital?\a148\a147From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\a148\a147Dear, dear, that\a146s bad!\a148 said Holmes, shaking his head.Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. \a147Why was it bad?\a148\a147Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you say?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.\a148\a147Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, Dr. James Mortimer\a151\a148\a147Mister, sir, Mister\a151 a humble M.R.C.S.\a148\a147And a man of precise mind, evidently.\a148\a147A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not\a151\a148\a147No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\a148\a147Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.\a148Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. \a147You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,\a148 said he. \a147I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.\a148The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion. \a147I presume, sir,\a148 said he at last, \a147that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?\a148\a147No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe\a151\a148\a147Indeed, sir. May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\a148 asked Holmes with some asperity.\a147To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly.\a148\a147Then had you not better consult him?\a148\a147I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently\a151\a148\a147Just a little,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.\a148\p\BChapter 2\B - \X1\BThe Curse of the Baskervilles\B\X1\a147I have in my pocket a manuscript,\a148 said Dr. James Mortimer.\a147I observed it as you entered the room,\a148 said Holmes.\a147It is an old manuscript.\a148\a147Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\a148\a147How can you say that, sir?\a148\a147You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.\a148\a147The exact date is 1742.\a148 Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket. \a147This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him.\a148Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee. \a147You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date.\a148I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: \a147Baskerville Hall,\a148 and below in large, scrawling figures: \a1471742.\a148\a147It appears to be a statement of some sort.\a148\a147Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family.\a148\a147But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?\a148\a147Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.\a148Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\c\i\a147Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.\i\c\c\i\a147Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man. This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word through the West. It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them. At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father\a146s farm.\i\c\c\i\a147It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink\a151 with other worse things, perchance\a151 to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her. Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid\a146s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\i\c\c\i\a147Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to understand all that had been done in such haste. But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of wine. But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\i\c\c\i\a147They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt. And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. \a145But I have seen more than that,\a146 said he, \a145for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.\a146 So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse\a146s head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds. These, though known for their valour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\i\c\c\i\a147The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started. The most of them would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.\i\c\c\i\a147Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.\i\c\c\i\a147[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Elizabeth.]\a148\i\cWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.\a147Well?\a148 said he.\a147Do you not find it interesting?\a148\a147To a collector of fairy tales.\a148Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\a147Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is the \iDevon County Chronicle\i of May 14th of this year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date.\a148My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\a147The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county. Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him. In these days of \inouveaux riches\i it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realized his gains and returned to England with them. It is only two years since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death. Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end. His generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.\a147The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes. Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles\a146s health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\a147The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o\a146clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles\a146s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master\a146s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles\a146s person, and though the doctor\a146s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion\a151 so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him\a151 it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner\a146s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles\a146s heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville\a146s younger brother. The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.\a148Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. \a147Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.\a148\a147I must thank you,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, \a147for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?\a148\a147It does.\a148\a147Then let me have the private ones.\a148 He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\a147In doing so,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, \a147I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner\a146s inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\a147The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\a147Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles\a146s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart\a151 so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.\a147I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification.\a147It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\a147On the night of Sir Charles\a146s death Barrymore the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did\a151 some little distance off, but fresh and clear.\a148\a147Footprints?\a148\a147Footprints.\a148\a147A man\a146s or a woman\a146s?\a148Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered.\a147Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\a148\p\BChapter 3\B - \X1\BThe Problem\B\X1I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill in the doctor\a146s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.\a147You saw this?\a148\a147As clearly as I see you.\a148\a147And you said nothing?\a148\a147What was the use?\a148\a147How was it that no one else saw it?\a148\a147The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought. I don\a146t suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend.\a148\a147There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\a148\a147No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\a148\a147You say it was large?\a148\a147Enormous.\a148\a147But it had not approached the body?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147What sort of night was it?\a146\a147Damp and raw.\a148\a147But not actually raining?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147What is the alley like?\a148\a147There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\a148\a147Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?\a148\a147Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.\a148\a147I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?\a148\a147Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\a148\a147Is there any other opening?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\a148\a147There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\a148\a147Had Sir Charles reached this?\a148\a147No; he lay about fifty yards from it.\a148\a147Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer\a151 and this is important\a151 the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?\a148\a147No marks could show on the grass.\a148\a147Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\a148\a147Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate.\a148\a147You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate closed?\a148\a147Closed and padlocked.\a148\a147How high was it?\a148\a147About four feet high.\a148\a147Then anyone could have got over it?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\a148\a147None in particular.\a148\a147Good heaven. Did no one examine?\a148\a147Yes, I examined, myself.\a148\a147And found nothing?\a148\a147It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes.\a148\a147How do you know that?\a148\a147Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\a148\a147Excellent. This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the marks?\a148\a147He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could discern no others.\a148Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture.\a147If I had only been there!\a148 he cried. \a147It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in. You have indeed much to answer for.\a148\a147I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so. Besides, besides\a151\a148\a147Why do you hesitate?\a148\a147There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless.\a148\a147You mean that the thing is supernatural?\a148\a147I did not positively say so.\a148\a147No, but you evidently think it.\a148\a147Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.\a148\a147For example?\a148\a147I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.\a148\a147And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?\a148\a147I do not know what to believe.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \a147I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,\a148 said he. \a147In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.\a148\a147The original hound was material enough to tug a man\a146s throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well.\a148\a147I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come to consult me at all. You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles\a146s death, and that you desire me to do it.\a148\a147I did not say that I desired you to do it.\a148\a147Then, how can I assist you?\a148\a147By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station\a148\a151 Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch\a151\a147in exactly one hour and a quarter.\a148\a147He being the heir?\a148\a147Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles\a146s will.\a148\a147There is no other claimant, I presume?\a148\a147None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?\a148\a147Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?\a148\a147It seems natural, does it not. And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.\a148Holmes considered for a little time.\a147Put into plain words, the matter is this,\a148 said he. \a147In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville\a151 that is your opinion?\a148\a147At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so.\a148\a147Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing.\a148\a147You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you recommend?\a148\a147I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville.\a148\a147And then?\a148\a147And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter.\a148\a147How long will it take you to make up your mind?\a148\a147Twenty-four hours. At ten o\a146clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you.\a148\a147I will do so, Mr. Holmes.\a148 He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\a147Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville\a146s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?\a148\a147Three people did.\a148\a147Did any see it after?\a148\a147I have not heard of any.\a148\a147Thank you. Good-morning.\a148Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.\a147Going out, Watson?\a148\a147Unless I can help you.\a148\a147No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When you pass Bradley\a146s, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco. Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning.\a148I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o\a146clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\a147Caught cold, Watson?\a148 said he.\a147No, it\a146s this poisonous atmosphere.\a148\a147I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.\a148\a147Thick. It is intolerable.\a148\a147Open the window, then. You have been at your club all day, I perceive.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147Am I right?\a148\a147Certainly, but how?\a148He laughed at my bewildered expression. \a147There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been. Is it not obvious?\a148\a147Well, it is rather obvious.\a148\a147The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?\a148\a147A fixture also.\a148\a147On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\a148\a147In spirit?\a148\a147Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford\a146s for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way about.\a148\a147A large-scale map, I presume?\a148\a147Very large.\a148He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. \a147Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the middle.\a148\a147With a wood round it?\a148\a147Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist\a151 Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again.\a148\a147It must be a wild place.\a148\a147Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men\a151\a148\a147Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.\a148\a147The devil\a146s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed. Of course, if Dr. Mortimer\a146s surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we\a146ll shut that window again, if you don\a146t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?\a148\a147Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\a148\a147What do you make of it?\a148\a147It is very bewildering.\a148\a147It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What do you make of that?\a148\a147Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley.\a148\a147He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147He was running, Watson\a151 running desperately, running for his life, running until he burst his heart\a151 and fell dead upon his face.\a148\a147Running from what?\a148\a147There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run.\a148\a147How can you say that?\a148\a147I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the gipsy\a146s evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house?\a148\a147You think that he was waiting for someone?\a148\a147The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?\a148\a147But he went out every evening.\a148\a147I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning.\a148\p\BChapter 4\B - \X1\BSir Henry Baskerville\B\X1Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman.\a147This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer.\a147Why, yes,\a148 said he, \a147and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out little puzzles, and I\a146ve had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it.\a148\a147Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\a148\a147Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this morning.\a148He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, \a147Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,\a148 was printed in rough characters; the post-mark \a147Charing Cross,\a148 and the date of posting the preceding evening.\a147Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\a148 asked Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\a147No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\a148\a147But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\a148\a147No, I had been staying with a friend,\a148 said the doctor.\a147There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\a148\a147Hum. Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\a148 Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.The word \a147moor\a148 only was printed in ink.\a147Now,\a148 said Sir Henry Baskerville, \a147perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?\a148\a147What do you make of it. Dr. Mortimer. You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\a148\a147No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural.\a148\a147What business?\a148 asked Sir Henry sharply. \a147It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\a148\a147You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I promise you that,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147We will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday\a146s \iTimes\i, Watson?\a148\a147It is here in the corner.\a148\a147Might I trouble you for it\a151 the inside page, please, with the leading articles?\a148 He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the columns. \a147Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an extract from it.\a145You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.\a146\a147What do you think of that, Watson?\a148 cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. \a147Don\a146t you think that is an admirable sentiment?\a148Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\a147I don\a146t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\a148 said he, \a147but it seems to me we\a146ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned.\a148\a147On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\a148\a147No, I confess that I see no connection.\a148\a147And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other. \a145You,\a146 \a145your,\a146 \a145your,\a146 \a145life,\a146 \a145reason,\a146 \a145value,\a146 \a145keep away,\a146 \a145from the.\a146 Don\a146t you see now whence these words have been taken?\a148\a147By thunder, you\a146re right. Well, if that isn\a146t smart!\a148 cried Sir Henry.\a147If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that \a145keep away\a146 and \a145from the\a146 are cut out in one piece.\a148\a147Well, now\a151 so it is!\a148\a147Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. \a147I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do it?\a148\a147I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimau?\a148\a147Most certainly.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the\a151\a148\a147But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a \iTimes\i article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the \iLeeds Mercury\i with the \iWestern Morning News\i. But a \iTimes\i leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday\a146s issue.\a148\a147So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Sir Henry Baskerville, \a147someone cut out this message with a scissors\a151\a148\a147Nail-scissors,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You can see that it was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over \a145keep away.\a146\a160\a148\a147That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste\a151\a148\a147Gum,\a148 said Holmes.\a147With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word \a145moor\a146 should have been written?\a148\a147Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but \a145moor\a146 would be less common.\a148\a147Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough characters. But \iThe Times\i is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others. \a145Life,\a146 for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption\a151 and from whom?\a148\a147We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer.\a147Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel.\a148\a147How in the world can you say that?\a148\a147If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated \iTimes\i leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message. Halloa. Halloa. What\a146s this?\a148He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\a147Well?\a148\a147Nothing,\a148 said he, throwing it down. \a147It is a blank half-sheet of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in London?\a148\a147Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.\a148\a147You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\a148\a147I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\a148 said our visitor. \a147Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?\a148\a147We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?\a148\a147Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\a148\a147I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.\a148Sir Henry smiled. \a147I don\a146t know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.\a148\a147You have lost one of your boots?\a148\a147My dear sir,\a148 cried Dr. Mortimer, \a147it is only mislaid. You will find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?\a148\a147Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes, \a147however foolish the incident may seem. You have lost one of your boots, you say?\a148\a147Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\a148\a147If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\a148\a147They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put them out.\a148\a147Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?\a148\a147I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots\a151 gave six dollars for them\a151 and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\a148\a147It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer\a146s belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found.\a148\a147And, now, gentlemen,\a148 said the baronet with decision, \a147it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at.\a148\a147Your request is a very reasonable one,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147Dr. Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us.\a148Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\a147Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\a148 said he when the long narrative was finished. \a147Of course, I\a146ve heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It\a146s the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my uncle\a146s death\a151 well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can\a146t get it clear yet. You don\a146t seem quite to have made up your mind whether it\a146s a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147And now there\a146s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose that fits into its place.\a148\a147It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer.\a147And also,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that someone is not ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of danger.\a148\a147Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.\a148\a147Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.\a148\a147Why should I not go?\a148\a147There seems to be danger.\a148\a147Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?\a148\a147Well, that is what we have to find out.\a148\a147Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.\a148 His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative. \a147Meanwhile,\a148 said he, \a147I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. It\a146s a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it\a146s half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I\a146ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me.\a148\a147Is that convenient to you, Watson?\a148\a147Perfectly.\a148\a147Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\a148\a147I\a146d prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\a148\a147I\a146ll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\a148 said his companion.\a147Then we meet again at two o\a146clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\a148We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action.\a147Your hat and boots, Watson, quick. Not a moment to lose!\a148 He rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.\a147Shall I run on and stop them?\a148\a147Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.\a148He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again.\a147There\a146s our man, Watson. Come along. We\a146ll have a good look at him, if we can do no more.\a148At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab. Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.\a147There now!\a148 said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles. \a147Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too. Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes!\a148\a147Who was the man?\a148\a147I have not an idea.\a148\a147A spy?\a148\a147Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen. If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\a148\a147Yes, I remember.\a148\a147I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious disadvantage.\a148\a147It puts him in the power of the cabman.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147What a pity we did not get the number!\a148\a147My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number. No. 2704 is our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.\a148\a147I fail to see how you could have done more.\a148\a147On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man.\a148We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us.\a147There is no object in our following them,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man\a146s face within the cab?\a148\a147I could swear only to the beard.\a148\a147And so could I\a151 from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\a148He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was warmly greeted by the manager.\a147Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?\a148\a147No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my life.\a148\a147My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability during the investigation.\a148\a147Yes, sir, he is still with us.\a148\a147Could you ring him up.thank you. And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note.\a148A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective.\a147Let me have the Hotel Directory,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Thank you. Now, Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147You will visit each of these in turn.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it. You understand?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147But what you are really looking for is the centre page of \iThe Times\i with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of \iThe Times\i. It is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of \iThe Times\i among it. The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.\a148\p\BChapter 5\B - \X1\BThree Broken Threads\B\X1Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.\a147Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\a148 said the clerk. \a147He asked me to show you up at once when you came.\a148\a147Have you any objection to my looking at your register?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Not in the least.\a148The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\a147Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\a148 said Holmes to the porter. \a147A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a limp?\a148\a147No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman, not older than yourself.\a148\a147Surely you are mistaken about his trade?\a148\a147No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well known to us.\a148\a147Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds another.\a148\a147She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.\a148\a147Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,\a148 he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. \a147We know now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.\a148\a147What does it suggest?\a148\a147It suggests\a151 halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?\a148As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.\a147Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,\a148 he cried. \a147They\a146ll find they\a146ve started in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can\a146t find my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but they\a146ve got a bit over the mark this time.\a148\a147Still looking for your boot?\a148\a147Yes, sir, and mean to find it.\a148\a147But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\a148\a147So it was, sir. And now it\a146s an old black one.\a148\a147What! you don\a146t mean to say\a151?\a148\a147That\a146s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the world\a151 the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it. Speak out, man, and don\a146t stand staring!\a148An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\a147No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word of it.\a148\a147Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I\a146ll see the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\a148\a147It shall be found, sir\a151 I promise you that if you will have a little patience it will be found.\a148\a147Mind it is, for it\a146s the last thing of mine that I\a146ll lose in this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you\a146ll excuse my troubling you about such a trifle\a151\a148\a147I think it\a146s well worth troubling about.\a148\a147Why, you look very serious over it.\a148\a147How do you explain it?\a148\a147I just don\a146t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest thing that ever happened to me.\a148\a147The queerest perhaps\a151\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully.\a147What do you make of it yourself?\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle\a146s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right.\a148We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business which had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his intentions.\a147To go to Baskerville Hall.\a148\a147And when?\a148\a147At the end of the week.\a148\a147On the whole,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I think that your decision is a wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?\a148Dr. Mortimer started violently. \a147Followed. By whom?\a148 \a147That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full beard?\a148\a147No\a151 or, let me see\a151 why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles\a146s butler, is a man with a full, black beard.\a148\a147Ha. Where is Barrymore?\a148\a147He is in charge of the Hall.\a148\a147We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility he might be in London.\a148\a147How can you do that?\a148\a147Give me a telegraph form. \a145Is all ready for Sir Henry?\a146 That will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest telegraph-office. Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: \a145Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.\a146 That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.\a148\a147That\a146s so,\a148 said Baskerville. \a147By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this Barrymore, anyhow?\a148\a147He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the county.\a148\a147At the same time,\a148 said Baskerville, \a147it\a146s clear enough that so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.\a148\a147That is true.\a148\a147Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles\a146s will?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.\a148\a147Ha. Did they know that they would receive this?\a148\a147Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his will.\a148\a147That is very interesting.\a148\a147I hope,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer, \a147that you do not look with suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me.\a148\a147Indeed. And anyone else?\a148\a147There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.\a148\a147And how much was the residue?\a148\a147Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.\a148Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. \a147I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,\a148 said he.\a147Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a million.\a148\a147Dear me. It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything happened to our young friend here\a151 you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis!\a151 who would inherit the estate?\a148\a147Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles\a146s younger brother died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\a148\a147Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr. James Desmond?\a148\a147Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.\a148\a147And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles\a146s thousands.\a148\a147He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.\a148\a147And have you made your will, Sir Henry?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I\a146ve had no time, for it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle\a146s idea. How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property. House, land, and dollars must go together.\a148\a147Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.\a148\a147Dr. Mortimer returns with me.\a148\a147But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side.\a148\a147Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person; but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.\a148\a147Whom would you recommend, then?\a148Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. \a147If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.\a148The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.\a147Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,\a148 said he. \a147You see how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I\a146ll never forget it.\a148The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion.\a147I will come, with pleasure,\a148 said I. \a147I do not know how I could employ my time better.\a148\a147And you will report very carefully to me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147When a crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?\a148\a147Would that suit Dr. Watson?\a148\a147Perfectly.\a148\a147Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the ten-thirty train from Paddington.\a148We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet.\a147My missing boot!\a148 he cried.\a147May all our difficulties vanish as easily!\a148 said Sherlock Holmes.\a147But it is a very singular thing,\a148 Dr. Mortimer remarked. \a147I searched this room carefully before lunch.\a148\a147And so did I,\a148 said Baskerville. \a147Every inch of it.\a148\a147There was certainly no boot in it then.\a148\a147In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were lunching.\a148The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles\a146s death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.The second:Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to trace cut sheet of \iTimes\i. CARTWRlGHT.\a147There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for another scent.\a148\a147We have still the cabman who drove the spy.\a148\a147Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my question.\a148The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.\a147I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had been inquiring for No. 2704,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146ve driven my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me.\a148\a147I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\a148 said Holmes. \a147On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions.\a148\a147Well, I\a146ve had a good day and no mistake,\a148 said the cabman with a grin. \a147What was it you wanted to ask, sir?\a148\a147First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\a148\a147John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley\a146s Yard, near Waterloo Station.\a148Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.\a147Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this house at ten o\a146clock this morning and afterwards followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street.\a148The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. \a147Why, there\a146s no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,\a148 said he. \a147The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.\a148\a147My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?\a148\a147Yes, he did.\a148\a147When did he say this?\a148\a147When he left me.\a148\a147Did he say anything more?\a148\a147He mentioned his name.\a148Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \a147Oh, he mentioned his name, did he. That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?\a148\a147His name,\a148 said the cabman, \a147was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\a148Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the cabman\a146s reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh.\a147A touch, Watson\a151 an undeniable touch!\a148 said he. \a147I feel a foil as quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\a148\a147Yes, sir, that was the gentleman\a146s name.\a148\a147Excellent. Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.\a148\a147He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here.\a148\a147This very door,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Well, I couldn\a146t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker Street and along\a151\a148\a147I know,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said: \a145It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\a146 That\a146s how I come to know the name.\a148\a147I see. And you saw no more of him?\a148\a147Not after he went into the station.\a148\a147And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148The cabman scratched his head. \a147Well, he wasn\a146t altogether such an easy gentleman to describe. I\a146d put him at forty years of age, and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don\a146t know as I could say more than that.\a148\a147Colour of his eyes?\a148\a147No, I can\a146t say that.\a148\a147Nothing more that you can remember?\a148\a147No, sir; nothing.\a148\a147Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There\a146s another one waiting for you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!\a148\a147Good-night, sir, and thank you!\a148John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.\a147Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,\a148 said he. \a147The cunning rascal. He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I\a146ve been checkmated in London. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I\a146m not easy in my mind about it.\a148\a147About what?\a148\a147About sending you. It\a146s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\a148\p\BChapter 6\B - \X1\BBaskerville Hall\B\X1Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions and advice.\a147I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, Watson,\a148 said he; \a147I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.\a148\a147What sort of facts?\a148 I asked.\a147Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results have, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\a148\a147Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore couple?\a148\a147By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor, and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must be your very special study.\a148\a147I will do my best.\a148\a147You have arms, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes, I thought it as well to take them.\a148\a147Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never relax your precautions.\a148Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting for us upon the platform.\a147No, we have no news of any kind,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my friend\a146s questions. \a147I can swear to one thing, and that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our notice.\a148\a147You have always kept together, I presume?\a148\a147Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of Surgeons.\a148\a147And I went to look at the folk in the park,\a148 said Baskerville.\a147But we had no trouble of any kind.\a148\a147It was imprudent, all the same,\a148 said Holmes, shaking his head and looking very grave. \a147I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other boot?\a148\a147No, sir, it is gone forever.\a148\a147Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,\a148 he added as the train began to glide down the platform. \a147Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us, and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil are exalted.\a148I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with Dr. Mortimer\a146s spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features of the Devon scenery.\a147I\a146ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,\a148 said he; \a147but I have never seen a place to compare with it.\a148\a147I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,\a148 I remarked.\a147It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer. \a147A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles\a146s head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\a148\a147I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father\a146s death and had never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I\a146m as keen as possible to see the moor.\a148\a147Are you. Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first sight of the moor,\a148 said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage window.Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely share it.The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy hart\a146s-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation\a151 sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\a147Halloa!\a148 cried Dr. Mortimer, \a147what is this?\a148A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we travelled.\a147What is this, Perkins?\a148 asked Dr. Mortimer.Our driver half turned in his seat. \a147There\a146s a convict escaped from Princetown, sir. He\a146s been out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every station, but they\a146ve had no sight of him yet. The farmers about here don\a146t like it, sir, and that\a146s a fact.\a148\a147Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give information.\a148\a147Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn\a146t like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.\a148\a147Who is he, then?\a148\a147It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\a148I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed with his whip.\a147Baskerville Hall,\a148 said he.Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars\a146 heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles\a146s South African gold.Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end.\a147Was it here?\a148 he asked in a low voice.\a147No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.\a148The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\a147It\a146s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a place as this,\a148 said he. \a147It\a146s enough to scare any man. I\a146ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won\a146t know it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front of the hall door.\a148The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.\a147Welcome, Sir Henry. Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\a148A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our bags.\a147You don\a146t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?\a148 said Dr. Mortimer. \a147My wife is expecting me.\a148\a147Surely you will stay and have some dinner?\a148\a147No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I can be of service.\a148The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags\a146 heads, the coats of arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.\a147It\a146s just as I imagined it,\a148 said Sir Henry. \a147Is it not the very picture of an old family home. To think that this should be the same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me solemn to think of it.\a148I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished features.\a147Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\a148\a147Is it ready?\a148\a147In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new conditions this house will require a considerable staff.\a148\a147What new conditions?\a148\a147I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have more company, and so you will need changes in your household.\a148\a147Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\a148\a147Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\a148\a147But your family have been with us for several generations, have they not. I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family connection.\a148I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler\a146s white face.\a147I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.\a148\a147But what do you intend to do?\a148\a147I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves in some business. Sir Charles\a146s generosity has given us the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.\a148A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall, approached by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as Baskerville\a146s and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents. At one end a minstrel\a146s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across above our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one\a146s voice became hushed and one\a146s spirit subdued. A dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by their silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.\a147My word, it isn\a146t a very cheerful place,\a148 said Sir Henry. \a147I suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present. I don\a146t wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.\a148I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in keeping with the rest.And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\p\BChapter 7\B - \X1\BThe Stapletons of Merripit House\B\X1The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.\a147I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!\a148 said the baronet. \a147We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive, so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more.\a148\a147And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,\a148 I answered. \a147Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing in the night?\a148\a147That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\a148\a147I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman.\a148\a147We must ask about this right away.\a148 He rang the bell and asked Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he listened to his master\a146s question.\a147There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,\a148 he answered. \a147One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.\a148And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this. And why did she weep so bitterly. Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man\a146s death. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in the cab in Regent Street. The beard might well have been the same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the point forever. Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore\a146s own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock Holmes.Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the telegram.\a147Certainly, sir,\a148 said he, \a147I had the telegram delivered to Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed.\a148\a147Who delivered it?\a148\a147My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the Hall last week, did you not?\a148\a147Yes, father, I delivered it.\a148\a147Into his own hands?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore\a146s hands, and she promised to deliver it at once.\a148\a147Did you see Mr. Barrymore?\a148\a147No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\a148\a147If you didn\a146t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\a148\a147Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,\a148 said the postmaster testily. \a147Didn\a146t he get the telegram. If there is any mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.\a148It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear that in spite of Holmes\a146s ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it were so\a151 suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then. Was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own. What interest could he have in persecuting the Baskerville family. I thought of the strange warning clipped out of the leading article of \iThe Times\i. Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon counteracting his schemes. The only conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.\a147You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,\a148 said he as he came panting up to where I stood. \a147Here on the moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit House.\a148\a147Your net and box would have told me as much,\a148 said I, \a147for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?\a148\a147I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his journey?\a148\a147He is very well, thank you.\a148\a147We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\a148\a147I do not think that it is likely.\a148\a147Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the family?\a148\a147I have heard it.\a148\a147It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor.\a148 He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seriously. \a147The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was weak.\a148\a147How did you know that?\a148\a147My friend Mortimer told me.\a148\a147You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of fright in consequence?\a148\a147Have you any better explanation?\a148\a147I have not come to any conclusion.\a148\a147Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended.\a147It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,\a148 said he. \a147The records of your detective have reached us here, and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.\a148\a147I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\a148\a147May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\a148\a147He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his attention.\a148\a147What a pity. He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or advice.\a148\a147I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 said Stapleton. \a147You are perfectly right to be wary and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\a148We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke.\a147A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.\a148My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry\a146s side. But then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton\a146s invitation, and we turned together down the path.\a147It is a wonderful place, the moor,\a148 said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges. \a147You never tire of the moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious.\a148\a147You know it well, then?\a148\a147I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do.\a148\a147Is it hard to know?\a148\a147Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything remarkable about that?\a148\a147It would be a rare place for a gallop.\a148\a147You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?\a148\a147Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.\a148Stapleton laughed. \a147That is the great Grimpen Mire,\a148 said he. \a147A false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable ponies!\a148Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion\a146s nerves seemed to be stronger than mine.\a147It\a146s gone!\a148 said he. \a147The mire has him. Two in two days, and many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It\a146s a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.\a148\a147And you say you can penetrate it?\a148\a147Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I have found them out.\a148\a147But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?\a148\a147Well, you see the hills beyond. They are really islands cut off on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them.\a148\a147I shall try my luck some day.\a148He looked at me with a surprised face. \a147For God\a146s sake put such an idea out of your mind,\a148 said he. \a147Your blood would be upon my head. I assure you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive. It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do it.\a148\a147Halloa!\a148 I cried. \a147What is that?\a148A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.\a147Queer place, the moor!\a148 said he.\a147But what is it?\a148\a147The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its prey. I\a146ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.\a148I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind us.\a147You are an educated man. You don\a146t believe such nonsense as that?\a148 said I. \a147What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?\a148\a147Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It\a146s the mud settling, or the water rising, or something.\a148\a147No, no, that was a living voice.\a148\a147Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\a148\a147No, I never did.\a148\a147It\a146s a very rare bird\a151 practically extinct\a151 in England now, but all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.\a148\a147It\a146s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.\a148\a147Yes, it\a146s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside yonder. What do you make of those?\a148The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a score of them at least.\a147What are they. Sheep-pens?\a148\a147No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go inside.\a147But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?\a148\a147Neolithic man\a151 no date.\a148\a147What did he do?\a148\a147He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant. It is surely Cyclopides.\a148A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England\a151 slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.\a147Go back!\a148 she said. \a147Go straight back to London, instantly.\a148I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\a147Why should I go back?\a148 I asked.\a147I cannot explain.\a148 She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance. \a147But for God\a146s sake do what I ask you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.\a148\a147But I have only just come.\a148\a147Man, man!\a148 she cried. \a147Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good. Go back to London. Start tonight. Get away from this place at all costs. Hush, my brother is coming. Not a word of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare\a146s-tails yonder. We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place.\a148Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.\a147Halloa, Beryl!\a148 said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\a147Well, Jack, you are very hot.\a148\a147Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!\a148 He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me.\a147You have introduced yourselves, I can see.\a148\a147Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor.\a148\a147Why, who do you think this is?\a148\a147I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\a148\a147No, no,\a148 said I. \a147Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is Dr. Watson.\a148A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. \a147We have been talking at cross purposes,\a148 said she.\a147Why, you had not very much time for talk,\a148 her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes.\a147I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a visitor,\a148 said she. \a147It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?\a148A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.\a147Queer spot to choose, is it not?\a148 said he as if in answer to my thought. \a147And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Beryl?\a148\a147Quite happy,\a148 said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.\a147I had a school,\a148 said Stapleton. \a147It was in the north country. The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one\a146s own character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window.\a148\a147It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull\a151 less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.\a148\a147No, no, I am never dull,\a148 said she quickly.\a147We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?\a148\a147I am sure that he would be delighted.\a148\a147Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready.\a148But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side.\a147I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,\a148 said she. \a147I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you.\a148\a147But I can\a146t forget them, Miss Stapleton,\a148 said I. \a147I am Sir Henry\a146s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.\a148\a147A woman\a146s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.\a148\a147No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.\a148An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\a147You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,\a148 said she. \a147My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\a147But what is the danger?\a148\a147You know the story of the hound?\a148\a147I do not believe in such nonsense.\a148\a147But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?\a148\a147Because it \iis\i the place of danger. That is Sir Henry\a146s nature. I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move.\a148\a147I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.\a148\a147I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said. There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object.\a148\a147My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!\a148 She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.\p\BChapter 8\B - \X1\BFirst Report of Dr. Watson\B\X1From this point onward I will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do.Baskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one\a146s soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation.One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an interesting study.He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being \it\a234te-\a224-t\a234te\i. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.The other day\a151 Thursday, to be more exact\a151 Dr. Mortimer lunched with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he. The Stapletons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry\a146s request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what. A sheep-dog of the moor. Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and monstrous. Was there a human agency in the matter. Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say. It was all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands tear down some other man\a146s gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I should send some description of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development of last night.First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.\a147Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?\a148 asked Sir Henry.Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\a147No,\a148 said he, \a147I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it up to me.\a148\a147Did you answer it yourself?\a148\a147No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.\a148In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\a147I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning, Sir Henry,\a148 said he. \a147I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?\a148Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now all arrived.Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man\a146s character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door.Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\p\BChapter 9\B - \X1\BThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\B\X1Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house\a151 it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore\a146s movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had expected.\a147I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it,\a148 said he. \a147Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\a148\a147Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\a148 I suggested.\a147Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he were here.\a148\a147I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\a148 said I. \a147He would follow Barrymore and see what he did.\a148\a147Then we shall do it together.\a148\a147But surely he would hear us.\a148\a147The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. We\a146ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\a148 Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the same.\a147What, are \iyou\i coming, Watson?\a148 he asked, looking at me in a curious way.\a147That depends on whether you are going on the moor,\a148 said I.\a147Yes, I am.\a148\a147Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\a148Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\a147My dear fellow,\a148 said he, \a147Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You understand me. I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\a148It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone.But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House.I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view\a151 the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist\a146s angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend\a146s knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit\a146s ends what to do.\a147Halloa, Watson. Where have you dropped from?\a148 said he. \a147You don\a146t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?\a148I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.\a147You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place for a man to be private,\a148 said he, \a147but, by thunder, the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing\a151 and a mighty poor wooing at that. Where had you engaged a seat?\a148\a147I was on that hill.\a148\a147Quite in the back row, eh. But her brother was well up to the front. Did you see him come out on us?\a148\a147Yes, I did.\a148\a147Did he ever strike you as being crazy\a151 this brother of hers?\a148\a147I can\a146t say that he ever did.\a148\a147I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket. What\a146s the matter with me, anyhow. You\a146ve lived near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now. Is there anything that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\a148\a147I should say not.\a148\a147He can\a146t object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he has this down on. What has he against me. I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers.\a148\a147Did he say so?\a148\a147That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I\a146ve only known her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and she, too\a151 she was happy when she was with me, and that I\a146ll swear. There\a146s a light in a woman\a146s eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn\a146t have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady. How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her. Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked. If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I\a146ll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.\a148I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled myself. Our friend\a146s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady\a146s own wishes and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.\a147I don\a146t say now that he isn\a146t a crazy man,\a148 said Sir Henry; \a147I can\a146t forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\a148\a147Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\a148\a147His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady\a146s friendship during that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter rests.\a148So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister\a146s suitor\a151 even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an agent\a151 that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these things have by one night\a146s work been thoroughly cleared.I have said \a147by one night\a146s work,\a148 but, in truth, it was by two nights\a146 work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o\a146clock in the morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights before.We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.\a147What are you doing here, Barrymore?\a148\a147Nothing, sir.\a148 His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. \a147It was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.\a148\a147On the second floor?\a148\a147Yes, sir, all the windows.\a148\a147Look here, Barrymore,\a148 said Sir Henry sternly, \a147we have made up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now. No lies. What were you doing at that window?\a148The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.\a147I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\a148\a147And why were you holding a candle to the window?\a148\a147Don\a146t ask me, Sir Henry\a151 don\a146t ask me. I give you my word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from you.\a148A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling hand of the butler.\a147He must have been holding it as a signal,\a148 said I. \a147Let us see if there is any answer.\a148 I held it as he had done, and stared out into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window.\a147There it is!\a148 I cried.\a147No, no, sir, it is nothing\a151 nothing at all!\a148 the butler broke in; \a147I assure you, sir\a151\a148\a147Move your light across the window, Watson!\a148 cried the baronet. \a147See, the other moves also. Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal. Come, speak up. Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this conspiracy that is going on?\a148The man\a146s face became openly defiant. \a147It is my business, and not yours. I will not tell.\a148\a147Then you leave my employment right away.\a148\a147Very good, sir. If I must I must.\a148\a147And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.\a148\a147No, no, sir; no, not against you!\a148 It was a woman\a146s voice, and Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.\a147We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,\a148 said the butler.\a147Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this. It is my doing, Sir Henry\a151 all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I asked him.\a148\a147Speak out, then. What does it mean?\a148\a147My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.\a148\a147Then your brother is\a151\a148\a147The escaped convict, sir\a151 Selden, the criminal.\a148\a147That\a146s the truth, sir,\a148 said Barrymore. \a147I said that it was not my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.\a148This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?\a147Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything until he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my mother\a146s heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister would. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and that we could not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what could we do. We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then you returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there. But every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake he has done all that he has.\a148The woman\a146s words came with an intense earnestness which carried conviction with them.\a147Is this true, Barrymore?\a148\a147Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\a148\a147Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about this matter in the morning.\a148When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light.\a147I wonder he dares,\a148 said Sir Henry.\a147It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.\a148\a147Very likely. How far do you think it is?\a148\a147Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.\a148\a147Not more than a mile or two off.\a148\a147Hardly that.\a148\a147Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!\a148The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing our duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no harm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the price if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\a147I will come,\a148 said I.\a147Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.\a148In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped out for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky, and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light still burned steadily in front.\a147Are you armed?\a148 I asked.\a147I have a hunting-crop.\a148\a147We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before he can resist.\a148\a147I say, Watson,\a148 said the baronet, \a147what would Holmes say to this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?\a148As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\a147My God, what\a146s that, Watson?\a148\a147I don\a146t know. It\a146s a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once before.\a148It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood straining our ears, but nothing came.\a147Watson,\a148 said the baronet, \a147it was the cry of a hound.\a148My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\a147What do they call this sound?\a148 he asked.\a147Who?\a148\a147The folk on the countryside.\a148\a147Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?\a148\a147Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\a148I hesitated but could not escape the question.\a147They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.\a148He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\a147A hound it was,\a148 he said at last, \a147but it seemed to come from miles away, over yonder, I think.\a148\a147It was hard to say whence it came.\a148\a147It rose and fell with the wind. Isn\a146t that the direction of the great Grimpen Mire?\a148\a147Yes, it is.\a148\a147Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn\a146t you think yourself that it was the cry of a hound. I am not a child. You need not fear to speak the truth.\a148\a147Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it might be the calling of a strange bird.\a148\a147No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these stories. Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause. You don\a146t believe it, do you, Watson?\a148\a147No, no.\a148\a147And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as that. And my uncle. There was the footprint of the hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don\a146t think that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!\a148It was as cold as a block of marble.\a147You\a146ll be all right tomorrow.\a148\a147I don\a146t think I\a146ll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that we do now?\a148\a147Shall we turn back?\a148\a147No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We are after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come on. We\a146ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon the moor.\a148We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near it\a151 just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\a147What shall we do now?\a148 whispered Sir Henry.\a147Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a glimpse of him.\a148The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps of the hunters.Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds. We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the distance.And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some distance away. The baronet\a146s nerves were still quivering from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me. \a147A warder, no doubt,\a148 said he. \a147The moor has been thick with them since this fellow escaped.\a148 Well, perhaps his explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further proof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. We are certainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation very much. But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants remains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to throw some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the next few days.\p\BChapter 10 - \X1Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\B\X1So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\iOctober 16th\i. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger\a151 ever present danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.And have I not cause for such a feeling. Consider the long sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day. It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now. Has he remained in London, or has he followed us down here? Could he\a151 could he be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one purpose I must now devote all my energies.My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called for me. \a147Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,\a148 he said. \a147He thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.\a148The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\a147I may have spoken too warmly, sir,\a148 said he, \a147and if I have, I am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more upon his track.\a148\a147If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different thing,\a148 said the baronet, \a147you only told us, or rather your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.\a148\a147I didn\a146t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry\a151 indeed I didn\a146t.\a148\a147The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton\a146s house, for example, with no one but himself to defend it. There\a146s no safety for anyone until he is under lock and key.\a148\a147He\a146ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to South America. For God\a146s sake, sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him. You can\a146t tell on him without getting my wife and me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\a148\a147What do you say, Watson?\a148I shrugged my shoulders. \a147If he were safely out of the country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden.\a148\a147But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?\a148\a147He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was hiding.\a148\a147That is true,\a148 said Sir Henry. \a147Well, Barrymore\a151\a148\a147God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart. It would have killed my poor wife had he been taken again.\a148\a147I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson. But, after what we have heard I don\a146t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\a148With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated and then came back.\a147You\a146ve been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it out. I\a146ve never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It\a146s about poor Sir Charles\a146s death.\a148The baronet and I were both upon our feet. \a147Do you know how he died?\a148\a147No, sir, I don\a146t know that.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.\a148\a147To meet a woman. He?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And the woman\a146s name?\a148\a147I can\a146t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her initials were L. L.\a148\a147How do you know this, Barrymore?\a148\a147Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman\a146s hand.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out Sir Charles\a146s study\a151 it had never been touched since his death\a151 and she found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was gray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said: \a145Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed the initials L. L.\a148\a147Have you got that slip?\a148\a147No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\a148\a147Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\a148\a147Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\a148\a147And you have no idea who L. L. is?\a148\a147No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles\a146s death.\a148\a147I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important information.\a148\a147Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for us. To rake this up couldn\a146t help our poor master, and it\a146s well to go carefully when there\a146s a lady in the case. Even the best of us\a151\a148\a147You thought it might injure his reputation?\a148\a147Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter.\a148\a147Very good, Barrymore; you can go.\a148 When the butler had left us Sir Henry turned to me. \a147Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?\a148\a147It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.\a148\a147So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?\a148\a147Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him down.\a148I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning\a146s conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short, with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.October 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil. Whatever his crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And then I thought of that other one\a151 the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out in that deluged\a151 the unseen watcher, the man of darkness. In the evening I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They were the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot two nights before.As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\a147By the way, Mortimer,\a148 said I as we jolted along the rough road, \a147I suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom you do not know?\a148\a147Hardly any, I think.\a148\a147Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?\a148He thought for a few minutes.\a147No,\a148 said he. \a147There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom I can\a146t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though,\a148 he added after a pause. \a147There is Laura Lyons\a151 her initials are L. L.\a151 but she lives in Coombe Tracey.\a148\a147Who is she?\a148 I asked.\a147She is Frankland\a146s daughter.\a148\a147What. Old Frankland the crank?\a148\a147Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what I hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.\a148\a147How does she live?\a148\a147I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting business.\a148He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland\a146s skull belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive. I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played \a233cart\a233 afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.\a147Well,\a148 said I, \a147has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he still lurking out yonder?\a148\a147I don\a146t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has brought nothing but trouble here. I\a146ve not heard of him since I left out food for him last, and that was three days ago.\a148\a147Did you see him then?\a148\a147No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\a148\a147Then he was certainly there?\a148\a147So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.\a148I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.\a147You know that there is another man then?\a148\a147Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\a148\a147Have you seen him?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147How do you know of him then?\a148\a147Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He\a146s in hiding, too, but he\a146s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don\a146t like it, Dr. Watson\a151 I tell you straight, sir, that I don\a146t like it.\a148 He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.\a147Now, listen to me, Barrymore. I have no interest in this matter but that of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don\a146t like.\a148Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\a147It\a146s all these goings-on, sir,\a148 he cried at last, waving his hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. \a147There\a146s foul play somewhere, and there\a146s black villainy brewing, to that I\a146ll swear. Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London again!\a148\a147But what is it that alarms you?\a148\a147Look at Sir Charles\a146s death. That was bad enough, for all that the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There\a146s not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What\a146s he waiting for. What does it mean. It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry\a146s new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\a148\a147But about this stranger,\a148 said I. \a147Can you tell me anything about him. What did Selden say. Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?\a148\a147He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not make out.\a148\a147And where did he say that he lived?\a148\a147Among the old houses on the hillside\a151 the stone huts where the old folk used to live.\a148\a147But how about his food?\a148\a147Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.\a148\a147Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.\a148 When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time. And what deep and earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial. There, in that hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which has vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mystery.\p\BChapter 11\B - \X1\BThe Man on the Tor\B\X1The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark places.I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we might obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed. A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was criticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how delicate my mission was.\a147I have the pleasure,\a148 said I, \a147of knowing your father.\a148It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. \a147There is nothing in common between my father and me,\a148 she said. \a147I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared.\a148\a147It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to see you.\a148The freckles started out on the lady\a146s face.\a147What can I tell you about him?\a148 she asked, and her fingers played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.\a147You knew him, did you not?\a148\a147I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took in my unhappy situation.\a148\a147Did you correspond with him?\a148The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\a147What is the object of these questions?\a148 she asked sharply.\a147The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.\a148She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.\a147Well, I\a146ll answer,\a148 she said. \a147What are your questions?\a148\a147Did you correspond with Sir Charles?\a148\a147I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity.\a148\a147Have you the dates of those letters?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Have you ever met him?\a148\a147Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\a148\a147But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has done?\a148She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\a147There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir Charles\a146s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs.\a148I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady\a146s statement bore the impress of truth upon it.\a147Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?\a148 I continued.Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. \a147Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question.\a148\a147I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\a148\a147Then I answer, certainly not.\a148\a147Not on the very day of Sir Charles\a146s death?\a148The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her dry lips could not speak the \a147No\a148 which I saw rather than heard.\a147Surely your memory deceives you,\a148 said I. \a147I could even quote a passage of your letter. It ran \a145Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o\a146clock.\a146\a160\a148I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme effort.\a147Is there no such thing as a gentleman?\a148 she gasped.\a147You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you wrote it?\a148\a147Yes, I did write it,\a148 she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of words. \a147I did write it. Why should I deny it. I have no reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.\a148\a147But why at such an hour?\a148\a147Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get there earlier.\a148\a147But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?\a148\a147Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor\a146s house?\a148\a147Well, what happened when you did get there?\a148\a147I never went.\a148\a147Mrs. Lyons!\a148\a147No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something intervened to prevent my going.\a148\a147What was that?\a148\a147That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\a148\a147You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you kept the appointment.\a148\a147That is the truth.\a148Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that point.\a147Mrs. Lyons,\a148 said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive interview, \a147you are taking a very great responsibility and putting yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?\a148\a147Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal.\a148\a147And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your letter?\a148\a147If you have read the letter you will know.\a148\a147I did not say that I had read all the letter.\a148\a147You quoted some of it.\a148\a147I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received on the day of his death.\a148\a147The matter is a very private one.\a148\a147The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.\a148\a147I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.\a148\a147I have heard so much.\a148\a147My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant everything to me\a151 peace of mind, happiness, self-respect\a151 everything. I knew Sir Charles\a146s generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own lips he would help me.\a148\a147Then how is it that you did not go?\a148\a147Because I received help in the interval from another source.\a148\a147Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?\a148\a147So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next morning.\a148The woman\a146s story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet the more I thought of the lady\a146s face and of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should she turn so pale. Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced from her. Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy. Surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor.And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people. Barrymore\a146s only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From there I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right one. If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth where my master had failed.Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along which I travelled.\a147Good-day, Dr. Watson,\a148 cried he with unwonted good humour, \a147you must really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratulate me.\a148My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.\a147It is a great day for me, sir\a151 one of the red-letter days of my life,\a148 he cried with many chuckles. \a147I have brought off a double event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton\a146s park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that. We\a146ll teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners, confound them. And I\a146ve closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and both in my favour. I haven\a146t had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his own warren.\a148\a147How on earth did you do that?\a148\a147Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading\a151 Frankland v. Morland, Court of Queen\a146s Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my verdict.\a148\a147Did it do you any good?\a148\a147None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight. I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am entitled. The case of Frankland \iv.\i Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.\a148\a147How so?\a148 I asked.The old man put on a very knowing expression. \a147Because I could tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way.\a148I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\a147Some poaching case, no doubt?\a148 said I with an indifferent manner.\a147Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about the convict on the moor?\a148I stared. \a147You don\a146t mean that you know where he is?\a148 said I.\a147I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so trace it to him?\a148He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. \a147No doubt,\a148 said I; \a147but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?\a148\a147I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes him his food.\a148My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my mind.\a147You\a146ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to the convict?\a148Here was luck indeed. And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A child. Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the convict\a146s, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\a147I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father\a146s dinner.\a148The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an angry cat.\a147Indeed, sir!\a148 said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. \a147Do you see that Black Tor over yonder. Well, do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it. It is the stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station. Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\a148I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.\a147You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able\a151 but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment something moving upon that hillside?\a148It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray.\a147Come, sir, come!\a148 cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. \a147You will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself.\a148The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.\a147Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!\a148There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.\a147Well. Am I right?\a148\a147Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.\a148\a147And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr. Watson. Not a word. You understand!\a148\a147Just as you wish.\a148\a147They have treated me shamefully\a151 shamefully. When the facts come out in Frankland \iv.\i Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going. You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!\a148But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place\a151 his secret was within my grasp.As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The place was empty.But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundle\a151 the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: \a147Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.\a148For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but he had set an agent\a151 the boy, perhaps\a151 upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel. I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut.\a147It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\a148 said a well-known voice. \a147I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.\a148\p\BChapter 12\B - \X1\BDeath on the Moor\B\X1For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.\a147Holmes!\a148 I cried\a151\a147Holmes!\a148\a147Come out,\a148 said he, \a147and please be careful with the revolver.\a148I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\a147I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,\a148 said I as I wrung him by the hand.\a147Or more astonished, eh?\a148\a147Well, I must confess to it.\a148\a147The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.\a148\a147My footprint, I presume?\a148\a147No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147I thought as much\a151 and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?\a148\a147I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson. And how did you localize me. You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?\a148\a147Yes, I saw you then.\a148\a147And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?\a148\a147No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to look.\a148\a147The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.\a148 He rose and peeped into the hut. \a147Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies. What\a146s this paper. So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147Well done. Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case.\a148\a147Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing. I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing.\a148\a147That was what I wished you to think.\a148\a147Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!\a148 I cried with some bitterness. \a147I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.\a148\a147My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.\a148\a147But why keep me in the dark?\a148\a147For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me\a151 you remember the little chap at the express office\a151 and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want more. He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and both have been invaluable.\a148\a147Then my reports have all been wasted!\a148\a151 My voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\a147Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case.\a148I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes\a146s praise drove my anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor.\a147That\a146s better,\a148 said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. \a147And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons\a151 it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.\a148The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\a147This is most important,\a148 said he when I had concluded. \a147It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Stapleton?\a148\a147I did not know of a close intimacy.\a148\a147There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife\a151\a148\a147His wife?\a148\a147I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality his wife.\a148\a147Good heavens, Holmes. Are you sure of what you say. How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?\a148\a147Sir Henry\a146s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister.\a148\a147But why this elaborate deception?\a148\a147Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman.\a148All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible\a151 a creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\a147It is he, then, who is our enemy\a151 it is he who dogged us in London?\a148\a147So I read the riddle.\a148\a147And the warning\a151 it must have come from her!\a148\a147Exactly.\a148The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\a147But are you sure of this, Holmes. How do you know that the woman is his wife?\a148\a147Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned it\a151 the name was different\a151 had disappeared with his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.\a148The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.\a147If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come in?\a148 I asked.\a147That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.\a148\a147And when she is undeceived?\a148\a147Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty to see her\a151 both of us\a151 tomorrow. Don\a146t you think, Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long. Your place should be at Baskerville Hall.\a148The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.\a147One last question, Holmes,\a148 I said as I rose. \a147Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all. What is he after?\a148Holmes\a146s voice sank as he answered:\a147It is murder, Watson\a151 refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. Another day\a151 two at the most\a151 and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side. Hark!\a148A terrible scream\a151 a prolonged yell of horror and anguish\a151 burst out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins.\a147Oh, my God!\a148 I gasped. \a147What is it. What does it mean?\a148Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\a147Hush!\a148 he whispered. \a147Hush!\a148The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\a147Where is it?\a148 Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. \a147Where is it, Watson?\a148\a147There, I think.\a148 I pointed into the darkness.\a147No, there!\a148Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\a147The hound!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147Come, Watson, come. Great heavens, if we are too late!\a148He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his feet upon the ground.\a147He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.\a148\a147No, no, surely not!\a148\a147Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of abandoning your charge. But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we\a146ll avenge him!\a148Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.\a147Can you see anything?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147But, hark, what is that?\a148A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left. On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us\a151 the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit\a151 the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\a147The brute. The brute!\a148 I cried with clenched hands. \a147Oh Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\a148\a147I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I know\a151 how could l know\a151 that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?\a148\a147That we should have heard his screams\a151 my God, those screams!\a151 and yet have been unable to save him. Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death. It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he. He shall answer for this deed.\a148\a147He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered\a151 the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!\a148We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\a147Why should we not seize him at once?\a148\a147Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet.\a148\a147What can we do?\a148\a147There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend.\a148Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.\a147We must send for help, Holmes. We cannot carry him all the way to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?\a148He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained friend. These were hidden fires, indeed!\a147A beard. A beard. The man has a beard!\a148\a147A beard?\a148\a147It is not the baronet\a151 it is\a151 why, it is my neighbour, the convict!\a148With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock\a151 the face of Selden, the criminal.Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. Boots, shirt, cap\a151 it was all Sir Henry\a146s. The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\a147Then the clothes have been the poor devil\a146s death,\a148 said he. \a147It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry\a146s\a151 the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability\a151 and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on his trail?\a148\a147He heard him.\a148\a147To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?\a148\a147A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our conjectures are correct\a151\a148\a147I presume nothing.\a148\a147Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.\a148\a147My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch\a146s body. We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\a148\a147I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police.\a148\a147Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa, Watson, what\a146s this. It\a146s the man himself, by all that\a146s wonderful and audacious. Not a word to show your suspicions\a151 not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground.\a148A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.\a147Why, Dr. Watson, that\a146s not you, is it. You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But, dear me, what\a146s this. Somebody hurt. Not\a151 don\a146t tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!\a148 He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.\a147Who\a151 who\a146s this?\a148 he stammered.\a147It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\a148Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from Holmes to me. \a147Dear me. What a very shocking affair! How did he die?\a148\a147He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\a148\a147I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about Sir Henry.\a148\a147Why about Sir Henry in particular?\a148 I could not help asking.\a147Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way\a148\a151 his eyes darted again from my face to Holmes\a146s\a151\a147did you hear anything else besides a cry?\a148\a147No,\a148 said Holmes; \a147did you?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147What do you mean, then?\a148\a147Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.\a148\a147We heard nothing of the kind,\a148 said I.\a147And what is your theory of this poor fellow\a146s death?\a148\a147I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.\a148\a147That seems the most reasonable theory,\a148 said Stapleton, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. \a147What do you think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148My friend bowed his compliments. \a147You are quick at identification,\a148 said he.\a147We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down. You are in time to see a tragedy.\a148\a147Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend\a146s explanation will cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me tomorrow.\a148\a147Oh, you return tomorrow?\a148\a147That is my intention.\a148\a147I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us?\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory case.\a148My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\a147I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning.\a148And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton\a146s offer of hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end.\p\BChapter 13\B - \X1\BFixing the Nets\B\X1\a147We\a146re at close grips at last,\a148 said Holmes as we walked together across the moor. \a147What a nerve the fellow has. How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.\a148\a147I am sorry that he has seen you.\a148\a147And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\a148\a147What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?\a148\a147It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.\a148\a147Why should we not arrest him at once?\a148\a147My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument\a146s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should we be for that. We could prove nothing against him. There\a146s the devilish cunning of it. If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\a148\a147Surely we have a case.\a148\a147Not a shadow of one\a151 only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.\a148\a147There is Sir Charles\a146s death.\a148\a147Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it. What signs are there of a hound. Where are the marks of its fangs. Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it.\a148\a147Well, then, tonight?\a148\a147We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct connection between the hound and the man\a146s death. We never saw the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this man\a146s trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one.\a148\a147And how do you propose to do so?\a148\a147I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.\a148I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.\a147Are you coming up?\a148\a147Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word, Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that Selden\a146s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these people.\a148\a147And so am I.\a148\a147Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are both ready for our suppers.\a148Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence. Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed desirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of breaking the news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.\a147I\a146ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the morning,\a148 said the baronet. \a147I guess I should have some credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn\a146t sworn not to go about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton asking me over there.\a148\a147I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\a148 said Holmes dryly. \a147By the way, I don\a146t suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?\a148Sir Henry opened his eyes. \a147How was that?\a148\a147This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the police.\a148\a147That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.\a148\a147That\a146s lucky for him\a151 in fact, it\a146s lucky for all of you, since you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole household. Watson\a146s reports are most incriminating documents.\a148\a147But how about the case?\a148 asked the baronet. \a147Have you made anything out of the tangle. I don\a146t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since we came down.\a148\a147I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want light\a151 but it is coming all the same.\a148\a147We\a146ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I\a146ll be ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.\a148\a147I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me your help.\a148\a147Whatever you tell me to do I will do.\a148\a147Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always asking the reason.\a148\a147Just as you like.\a148\a147If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt\a151\a148He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of alertness and expectation.\a147What is it?\a148 we both cried.I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with amused exultation.\a147Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,\a148 said he as he waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. \a147Watson won\a146t allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very fine series of portraits.\a148\a147Well, I\a146m glad to hear you say so,\a148 said Sir Henry, glancing with some surprise at my friend. \a147I don\a146t pretend to know much about these things, and I\a146d be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I didn\a146t know that you found time for such things.\a148\a147I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That\a146s a Kneller, I\a146ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family portraits, I presume?\a148\a147Every one.\a148\a147Do you know the names?\a148\a147Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my lessons fairly well.\a148\a147Who is the gentleman with the telescope?\a148\a147That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt.\a148\a147And this Cavalier opposite to me\a151 the one with the black velvet and the lace?\a148\a147Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles. We\a146re not likely to forget him.\a148I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\a147Dear me!\a148 said Holmes, \a147he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.\a148\a147There\a146s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.\a148Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\a147Do you see anything there?\a148I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.\a147Is it like anyone you know?\a148\a147There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\a148\a147Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\a148 He stood upon a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried in amazement.The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\a147Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that he should see through a disguise.\a148\a147But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\a148\a147Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a Baskerville\a151 that is evident.\a148\a147With designs upon the succession.\a148\a147Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!\a148 He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\a147Yes, we should have a full day today,\a148 he remarked, and he rubbed his hands with the joy of action. \a147The nets are all in place, and the drag is about to begin. We\a146ll know before the day is out whether we have caught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the meshes.\a148\a147Have you been on the moor already?\a148\a147I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at his master\a146s grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.\a148\a147What is the next move?\a148\a147To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\a148\a147Good-morning, Holmes,\a148 said the baronet. \a147You look like a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\a148\a147That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\a148\a147And so do I.\a148\a147Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends the Stapletons tonight.\a148\a147I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you.\a148\a147I fear that Watson and I must go to London.\a148\a147To London?\a148\a147Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present juncture.\a148The baronet\a146s face perceptibly lengthened.\a147I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.\a148\a147My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have come with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them that message?\a148\a147If you insist upon it.\a148\a147There is no alternative, I assure you.\a148I saw by the baronet\a146s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he regarded as our desertion.\a147When do you desire to go?\a148 he asked coldly.\a147Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret that you cannot come.\a148\a147I have a good mind to go to London with you,\a148 said the baronet. \a147Why should I stay here alone?\a148\a147Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\a148\a147All right, then, I\a146ll stay.\a148\a147One more direction. I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.\a148\a147To walk across the moor?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do.\a148\a147This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that you should do it.\a148\a147Then I will do it.\a148\a147And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\a148\a147I will do just what you say.\a148\a147Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\a148I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A small boy was waiting upon the platform.\a147Any orders, sir?\a148\a147You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.\a148The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty. Lestrade.\a147That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\a148His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.\a147I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville,\a148 said he. \a147My friend here, Dr. Watson, has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have withheld in connection with that matter.\a148\a147What have I withheld?\a148 she asked defiantly.\a147You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten o\a146clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have withheld what the connection is between these events.\a148\a147There is no connection.\a148\a147In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as well.\a148The lady sprang from her chair.\a147His wife!\a148 she cried.\a147The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his sister is really his wife.\a148Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip.\a147His wife!\a148 she said again. \a147His wife. He is not a married man.\a148Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147Prove it to me. Prove it to me. And if you can do so\a151!\a148The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\a147I have come prepared to do so,\a148 said Holmes, drawing several papers from his pocket. \a147Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four years ago. It is indorsed \a145Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,\a146 but you will have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight. Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver\a146s private school. Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.\a148She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face of a desperate woman.\a147Mr. Holmes,\a148 she said, \a147this man had offered me marriage on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever told me. And why\a151 why. I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with me. Why should I try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts. Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear to you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.\a148\a147I entirely believe you, madam,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147The recital of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?\a148\a147He dictated it.\a148\a147I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment?\a148\a147He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man should find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us.\a148\a147He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir Charles?\a148\a147He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me into remaining silent.\a148\a147Quite so. But you had your suspicions?\a148She hesitated and looked down.\a147I knew him,\a148 she said. \a147But if he had kept faith with me I should always have done so with him.\a148\a147I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.\a148\a147Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us,\a148 said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town. \a147I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year \a14666, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.\a148The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.\a147Anything good?\a148 he asked.\a147The biggest thing for years,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We have two hours before we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never been there. Ah, well, I don\a146t suppose you will forget your first visit.\a148\p\BChapter 14\B - \X1\BThe Hound of the Baskervilles\B\X1One of Sherlock Holmes\a146s defects\a151 if, indeed, one may call it a defect\a151 was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland\a146s house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.\a147Are you armed, Lestrade?\a148The little detective smiled. \a147As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.\a148\a147Good. My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\a148\a147You\a146re mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What\a146s the game now?\a148\a147A waiting game.\a148\a147My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,\a148 said the detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. \a147I see the lights of a house ahead of us.\a148\a147That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\a148We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.\a147This will do,\a148 said he. \a147These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen.\a148\a147We are to wait here?\a148\a147Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow, Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you tell the position of the rooms. What are those latticed windows at this end?\a148\a147I think they are the kitchen windows.\a148\a147And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\a148\a147That is certainly the dining-room.\a148\a147The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing\a151 but for heaven\a146s sake don\a146t let them know that they are watched!\a148I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained window.There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and re-entered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen.\a147You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?\a148 Holmes asked when I had finished my report.\a147No.\a148\a147Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen?\a148\a147I cannot think where she is.\a148I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes\a146s face was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.\a147It\a146s moving towards us, Watson.\a148\a147Is that serious?\a148\a147Very serious, indeed\a151 the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans. He can\a146t be very long, now. It is already ten o\a146clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path.\a148The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over their cigars.Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.\a147If he isn\a146t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In half an hour we won\a146t be able to see our hands in front of us.\a148\a147Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?\a148\a147Yes, I think it would be as well.\a148So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.\a147We are going too far,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our ground where we are.\a148 He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground. \a147Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.\a148A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a man who is ill at ease.\a147Hist!\a148 cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol. \a147Look out. It\a146s coming!\a148There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes\a146s elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature\a146s flank. With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our friend\a146s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet\a146s teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.\a147My God!\a148 he whispered. \a147What was it. What, in heaven\a146s name, was it?\a148\a147It\a146s dead, whatever it is,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We\a146ve laid the family ghost once and forever.\a148In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two\a151 gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness.\a147Phosphorus,\a148 I said.\a147A cunning preparation of it,\a148 said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal. \a147There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to receive him.\a148\a147You have saved my life.\a148\a147Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\a148\a147Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for anything. So. Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?\a148\a147To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.\a148He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering with his face buried in his hands.\a147We must leave you now,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The rest of our work must be done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we only want our man.\a147It\a146s a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,\a148 he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. \a147Those shots must have told him that the game was up.\a148\a147We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\a148\a147He followed the hound to call him off\a151 of that you may be certain. No, no, he\a146s gone by this time. But we\a146ll search the house and make sure.\a148The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.\a147There\a146s someone in here,\a148 cried Lestrade. \a147I can hear a movement. Open this door!\a148A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of the face, and over it two dark eyes\a151 eyes full of grief and shame and a dreadful questioning\a151 stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck.\a147The brute!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her in the chair. She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.\a148She opened her eyes again.\a147Is he safe?\a148 she asked. \a147Has he escaped?\a148\a147He cannot escape us, madam.\a148\a147No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry. Is he safe?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And the hound?\a148\a147It is dead.\a148She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\a147Thank God. Thank God. Oh, this villain. See how he has treated me!\a148 She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises. \a147But this is nothing\a151 nothing. It is my mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool.\a148 She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke.\a147You bear him no good will, madam,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Tell us then where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone.\a148\a147There is but one place where he can have fled,\a148 she answered. \a147There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he would fly.\a148The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the lamp towards it.\a147See,\a148 said he. \a147No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire tonight.\a148She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with fierce merriment.\a147He may find his way in, but never out,\a148 she cried. \a147How can he see the guiding wands tonight. We planted them together, he and I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out today. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!\a148It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the night\a146s adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this woman\a146s life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband\a146s track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. \a147Meyers, Toronto,\a148 was printed on the leather inside.\a147It is worth a mud bath,\a148 said he. \a147It is our friend Sir Henry\a146s missing boot.\a148\a147Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.\a148\a147Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least that he came so far in safety.\a148But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried.Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the \id\a233bris\i.\a147A dog!\a148 said Holmes. \a147By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor. I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder\a148\a151 he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.\p\BChapter 15\B - \X1\BA Retrospection\B\X1It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.\a147The whole course of events,\a148 said Holmes, \a147from the point of view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my indexed list of cases.\a148\a147Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from memory.\a148\a147Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers\a146 ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes, however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\a147My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is the same as his father\a146s. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and fled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire. His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage home, and that he had used this man\a146s ability to make the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun well sank from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his fortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to the south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.\a147We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife with him in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.\a147The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him, knew that the old man\a146s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt to the real murderer.\a147Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his chance.\a147But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy. Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a deadlock.\a147He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London. He then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he had waited.\a147Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track but the man\a146s was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned away again. It was then that it left the print which was actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case within the scope of our observation.\a147So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only known to him. However, both of them were under his influence, and he had nothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully accomplished but the more difficult still remained.\a147It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton\a146s first idea was that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her. It was for this reason that he took her to London with him. They lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband\a151 a fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment\a151 that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton\a146s hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.\a147It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry\a146s attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and obtained another\a151 a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound, as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more \ioutr\a233\i and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.\a147Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think that Stapleton\a146s career of crime has been by no means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.\a147We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back my own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was no chance for him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of the baronet.\a148\a147One moment!\a148 said I. \a147You have, no doubt, described the sequence of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in London?\a148\a147I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years, as far back as the schoolmastering days, so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England, while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\a147The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended upon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to the west country.\a147It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.\a147I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton\a146s. I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations.\a147By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton\a146s attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\a147It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At his command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down the baronet\a146s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained.\a148\a147He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old uncle with his bogie hound.\a148\a147The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance which might be offered.\a148\a147No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so close to the property. How could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?\a148\a147It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the property from South America, establish his identity before the British authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box for \iLes Huguenots\i. Have you heard the De Reszkes. Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at Marcini\a146s for a little dinner on the way?\a148\p\c\l\B\X0The Return Of Sherlock Holmes\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\c\p\B\l\X1\BThe Empty House\B\X1\c\i\m="empt-05.png"\i\cIt was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month.It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public, and I even attempted more than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success. There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day as I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind, and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling a twice-told tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth, at that time Governor of one of the Australian Colonies. Adair\a146s mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at 427, Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society, had, so far as was known, no enemies, and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest the man\a146s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the night of March 30, 1894.Ronald Adair was fond of cards, playing continually, but never for such stakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had also played there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played with him\a151 Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran\a151 showed that the game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards. Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious player, and usually rose a winner. It came out in evidence that in partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history, as it came out at the inquest.On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten. His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor, generally used as his sitting-room. She had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window. No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her daughter. Desiring to say good-night, she had attempted to enter her son\a146s room. The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking. Help was obtained and the door forced. The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room. On the table lay two bank-notes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money arranged in little piles of varying amount. There were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite to them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex. In the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside. There was the possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped by the window. The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road. Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the door. But how did he come by his death. No one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the window, it would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare, and there is a cab-stand within a hundred yards of the house. No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man, and there the revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death. Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further complicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young Adair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room.All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made little progress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself about six o\a146clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window, directed me to the house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others crowded round to listen to what he said. I got as near him as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in some disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man, who had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying. I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title of one of them, \iThe Origin of Tree Worship\i, and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile who, either as a trade or as a hobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize for the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner. With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his curved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.My observations of No. 427, Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested. The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no water-pipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it. More puzzled than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book-collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm.\a147You\a146re surprised to see me, sir,\a148 said he, in a strange, croaking voice.I acknowledged that I was.\a147Well, I\a146ve a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into this house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I\a146ll just step in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much obliged to him for picking up my books.\a148\a147You make too much of a trifle,\a148 said I. \a147May I ask how you knew who I was?\a148\a147Well, sir, if it isn\a146t too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours, for you\a146ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street, and very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself, sir; here\a146s \iBritish Birds\i, and \iCatullus\i, and \iThe Holy War\ia bargain every one of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?\a148I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. Certainly a grey mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of brandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand.\a147My dear Watson,\a148 said the well-remembered voice, \a147I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.\a148I gripped him by the arm.\a147Holmes!\a148 I cried. \a147Is it really you. Can it indeed be that you are alive. Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss?\a148\a147Wait a moment,\a148 said he. \a147Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things. I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.\a148\a147I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. Good heavens, to think that you\a151 you of all men\a151 should be standing in my study!. Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin, sinewy arm beneath it. \a147Well, you\a146re not a spirit, anyhow,\a148 said I. \a147My dear chap, I am overjoyed to see you. Sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.\a148He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant manner. He was dressed in the seedy frock-coat of the book merchant, but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table. Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but there was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one.\a147I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end. Now, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations we have, if I may ask for your co-operation, a hard and dangerous night\a146s work in front of us. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished.\a148\a147I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.\a148\a147You\a146ll come with me to-night?\a148\a147When you like and where you like.\a148\a147This is indeed like the old days. We shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that chasm. I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.\a148\a147You never were in it?\a148\a147No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely genuine. I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. I read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes. I exchanged some remarks with him, therefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my stick and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When I reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon the brink of the fall. I have some knowledge, however, of \ibaritsu\i, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands. But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.\a148I listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette.\a147But the tracks!\a148 I cried. \a147I saw with my own eyes that two went down the path and none returned.\a148\a147It came about in this way. The instant that the Professor had disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men. One or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living. So rapidly does the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall.\a147I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. In your picturesque account of the matter, which I read with great interest some months later, you assert that the wall was sheer. This was not literally true. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true, have reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I should risk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared beneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that I seemed to hear Moriarty\a146s voice screaming at me out of the abyss. A mistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards, and at last I reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched when you, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death.\a147At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions, you departed for the hotel and I was left alone. I had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the path, and bounded over into the chasm. For an instant I thought that it was an accident; but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man\a146s head against the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon which I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning of this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A confederate\a151 and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was\a151 had kept guard while the Professor had attacked me. From a distance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend\a146s death and of my escape. He had waited, and then, making his way round to the top of the cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed.\a147I did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that grim face look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the precursor of another stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I don\a146t think I could have done it in cold blood. It was a hundred times more difficult than getting up. But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway down I slipped, but by the blessing of God I landed, torn and bleeding, upon the path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.\a147I had only one confidant\a151 my brother Mycroft. I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I was dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true. Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when you upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. As to Mycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which I needed. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa and spending some days with the head Llama. You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum, the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France I spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpelier, in the South of France. Having concluded this to my satisfaction, and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London, I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson, that at two o\a146clock to-day I found myself in my old arm-chair in my own old room, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned.\a148Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April evening\a151 a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and the keen, eager face, which I had never thought to see again. In some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words. \a147Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson,\a148 said he, \a147and I have a piece of work for us both to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will in itself justify a man\a146s life on this planet\a148. In vain I begged him to tell me more. \a147You will hear and see enough before morning,\a148 he answered. \a147We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house.\a148It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent. As the gleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features I saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. I knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal London, but I was well assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave one, while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest.I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes stopped the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed. Our route was certainly a singular one. Holmes\a146s knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he passed rapidly, and with an assured step, through a network of mews and stables the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at last into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into Manchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. We entered together and he closed it behind us.The place was pitch-dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty house. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons. Holmes\a146s cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forwards down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door. Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right, and we found ourselves in a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. There was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only just discern each other\a146s figures within. My companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.\a147Do you know where we are?\a148 he whispered.\a147Surely that is Baker Street,\a148 I answered, staring through the dim window.\a147Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old quarters.\a148\a147But why are we here?\a148\a147Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our old rooms\a151 the starting-point of so many of our little adventures. We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.\a148I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. He was quivering with silent laughter.\a147Well?\a148 said he.\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried. \a147It is marvellous.\a148\a147I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety,\a146\a160\a148 said he, and I recognised in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation. \a147It really is rather like me, is it not?\a148\a147I should be prepared to swear that it was you.\a148\a147The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of Grenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust in wax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this afternoon.\a148\a147But why?\a148\a147Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really elsewhere.\a148\a147And you thought the rooms were watched?\a148\a147I \iknew\i that they were watched.\a148\a147By whom?\a148\a147By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew, and only they knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they believed that I should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive.\a148\a147How do you know?\a148\a147Because I recognised their sentinel when I glanced out of my window. He is a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a garrotter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the Jew\a146s harp. I cared nothing for him. But I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is the man who is after me to-night, Watson, and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after \ihim\i.\a148My friend\a146s plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait and we were the hunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. Holmes was silent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was a bleak and boisterous night, and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in their coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen the same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion\a146s attention to them, but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued to stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him when I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes\a146s arm and pointed upwards.\a147The shadow has moved!. I cried.It was, indeed, no longer the profile, but the back, which was turned towards us.Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own.\a147Of course it has moved,\a148 said he. \a147Am I such a farcical bungler, Watson, that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it. We have been in this room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure eight times, or once in every quarter of an hour. She works it from the front so that her shadow may never be seen. Ah!. He drew in his breath with a shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown forward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. Outside, the street was absolutely deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the doorway, but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that thin, sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. An instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the direction of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps crept down the passage\a151 steps which were meant to be silent, but which reverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back against the wall and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had braced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window, and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to the level of this opening the light of the street, no longer dimmed by the dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside himself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars and his features were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin, projecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache. An opera-hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress shirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt and swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-block. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window, and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and saw that amazing target, the black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his fore sight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman\a146s back and hurled him flat upon his face. He was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized Holmes by the throat; but I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.\a147That you, Lestrade?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It\a146s good to see you back in London, sir.\a148\a147I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected murders in one year won\a146t do, Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery with less than your usual\a151 that\a146s to say, you handled it fairly well.\a148We had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a stalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed it, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner.It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned towards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil. But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with their drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and the threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature\a146s plainest danger-signals. He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed upon Holmes\a146s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended. \a147You fiend!\a148 he kept on muttering. \a147You clever, clever fiend!\a148\a147Ah, Colonel!\a148 said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar; \a147\a160\a145journeys end in lovers\a146 meetings,\a146 as the old play says. I don\a146t think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as I lay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall.\a148The Colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. \a147You cunning, cunning fiend!\a148 was all that he could say.\a147I have not introduced you yet,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This, gentlemen, is Colonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty\a146s Indian Army, and the best heavy game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced. I believe I am correct, Colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled?\a148The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger himself.\a147I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It must be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a young kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger. This empty house is my tree and you are my tiger. You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you. These,\a148 he pointed around, \a147are my other guns. The parallel is exact.\a148Colonel Moran sprang forward, with a snarl of rage, but the constables dragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible to look at.\a147I confess that you had one small surprise for me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window. I had imagined you as operating from the street, where my friend Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you. With that exception all has gone as I expected.\a148Colonel Moran turned to the official detective.\a147You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,\a148 said he, \a147but at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this person. If I am in the hands of the law let things be done in a legal way.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s reasonable enough,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147Nothing further you have to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?\a148Holmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor and was examining its mechanism.\a147An admirable and unique weapon,\a148 said he, \a147noiseless and of tremendous power. I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it to the order of the late Professor Moriarty. For years I have been aware of its existence, though I have never before had the opportunity of handling it. I commend it very specially to your attention, Lestrade, and also the bullets which fit it.\a148\a147You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Lestrade, as the whole party moved towards the door. \a147Anything further to say?\a148\a147Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?\a148\a147What charge, sir. Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\a148\a147Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you. With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him.\a148\a147Got him. Got whom, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain\a151 Colonel Sebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding bullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor front of No. 427, Park Lane, upon the 30th of last month. That\a146s the charge, Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you can endure the draught from a broken window, I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement.\a148Our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of Mycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I entered I saw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all in their place. There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained, deal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens would have been so glad to burn. The diagrams, the violin-case, and the pipe-rack\a151 even the Persian slipper which contained the tobacco\a151 all met my eyes as I glanced round me. There were two occupants of the room\a151 one Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered; the other the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening\a146s adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressing-gown of Holmes\a146s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect.\a147I hope you preserved all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?\a148 said Holmes.\a147I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.\a148\a147Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe where the bullet went?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I\a146m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I picked it up from the carpet. Here it is!\a148Holmes held it out to me. \a147A soft revolver bullet, as you perceive, Watson. There\a146s genius in that, for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an air-gun. All right, Mrs. Hudson, I am much obliged for your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see you in your old seat once more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you.\a148He had thrown off the seedy frock-coat, and now he was the Holmes of old in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy.\a147The old shikari\a146s nerves have not lost their steadiness nor his eyes their keenness,\a148 said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust.\a147Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few better in London. Have you heard the name?\a148\a147No, I have not.\a148\a147Well, well, such is fame. But, then, if I remember aright, you had not heard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great brains of the century. Just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf.\a148He turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar.\a147My collection of M\a146s is a fine one,\a148 said he. \a147Moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner, and Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who knocked out my left canine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our friend of to-night.\a148He handed over the book, and I read: \a147\iMoran, Sebastian, Colonel\i. Unemployed. Formerly 1st Bengalore Pioneers. Born London, 1840. Son of Sir Augustus Moran, C.B., once British Minister to Persia. Educated Eton and Oxford. Served in Jowaki Campaign, Afghan Campaign, Charasiab (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of \iHeavy Game of the Western Himalayas\i, 1881; \iThree Months in the Jungle\i, 1884. Address. Conduit Street. Clubs. The Anglo-Indian, the Tankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club.\a148On the margin was written, in Holmes\a146s precise hand: \a147The second most dangerous man in London.\a148\a147This is astonishing,\a148 said I, as I handed back the volume. \a147The man\a146s career is that of an honourable soldier.\a148\a147It is true,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147Up to a certain point he did well. He was always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family.\a148\a147It is surely rather fanciful.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran began to go wrong. Without any open scandal he still made India too hot to hold him. He retired, came to London, and again acquired an evil name. It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty, to whom for a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied him liberally with money and used him only in one or two very high-class jobs which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have some recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887. Not. Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it; but nothing could be proved. So cleverly was the Colonel concealed that even when the Moriarty gang was broken up we could not incriminate him. You remember at that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the shutters for fear of air-guns. No doubt you thought me fanciful. I knew exactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable gun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it. When we were in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty, and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the Reichenbach ledge.\a147You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the heels. So long as he was free in London my life would really not have been worth living. Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and sooner or later his chance must have come. What could I do. I could not shoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. There was no use appealing to a magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But I watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get him. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at last. Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done it. He had played cards with the lad; he had followed him home from the club; he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of it. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. I came over at once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct the Colonel\a146s attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way \iat once\i, and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I left him an excellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they might be needed\a151 by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy\a151 I took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?\a148\a147Yes,\a148 said I. \a147You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran\a146s motive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair.\a148\a147Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture where the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be correct as mine.\a148\a147You have formed one, then?\a148\a147I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came out in evidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had between them won a considerable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly played foul\a151 of that I have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had discovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken to him privately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club and promised not to play cards again. It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well-known man so much older than himself. Probably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card gains. He therefore murdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his partner\a146s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins. Will it pass?\a148\a147I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.\a148\a147It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come what may, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more, the famous air-gun of Von Herder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum, and once again Mr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so plentifully presents.\a148\p\X1\BThe Norwood Builder\B\X1\c\i\m="norw-06.png"\i\c\a147From the point of view of the criminal expert,\a148 said Mr. Sherlock Holmes, \a147London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty.\a148\a147I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you,\a148 I answered.\a147Well, well, I must not be selfish,\a148 said he, with a smile, as he pushed back his chair from the breakfast-table. \a147The community is certainly the gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-work specialist, whose occupation has gone. With that man in the field one\a146s morning paper presented infinite possibilities. Often it was only the smallest trace, Watson, the faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of the edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the centre. Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage\a151 to the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole. To the scientific student of the higher criminal world no capital in Europe offered the advantages which London then possessed. But now\a151\a151. He shrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce.At the time of which I speak Holmes had been back for some months, and I, at his request, had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named Verner, had purchased my small Kensington practice, and given with astonishingly little demur the highest price that I ventured to ask\a151 an incident which only explained itself some years later when I found that Verner was a distant relation of Holmes\a146s, and that it was my friend who had really found the money.Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case of the papers of Ex-President Murillo, and also the shocking affair of the Dutch steamship \iFriesland\i, which so nearly cost us both our lives. His cold and proud nature was always averse, however, to anything in the shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his successes\a151 a prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been removed.Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion, when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell, followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were beating on the outer door with his fist. As it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, dishevelled, and palpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one to the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.\a147I\a146m sorry, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he cried. \a147You mustn\a146t blame me. I am nearly mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.\a148He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner; but I could see by my companion\a146s unresponsive face that it meant no more to him than to me.\a147Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,\a148 said he, pushing his case across. \a147I am sure that with your symptoms my friend Dr. Watson here would prescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very warm these last few days. Now, if you feel a little more composed, I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is that you want. You mentioned your name as if I should recognise it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know nothing whatever about you.\a148Familiar as I was with my friend\a146s methods, it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had prompted them. Our client, however, stared in amazement.\a147Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes, and in addition I am the most unfortunate man at this moment in London. For Heaven\a146s sake don\a146t abandon me, Mr. Holmes. If they come to arrest me before I have finished my story, make them give me time so that I may tell you the whole truth. I could go to gaol happy if I knew that you were working for me outside.\a148\a147Arrest you!\a148 said Holmes. \a147This is really most grati\a151 most interesting. On what charge do you expect to be arrested?\a148\a147Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.\a148My companion\a146s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I am afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.\a147Dear me,\a148 said he; \a147it was only this moment at breakfast that I was saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers.\a148Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the \iDaily Telegraph\i, which still lay upon Holmes\a146s knee.\a147If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which I have come to you this morning. I feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man\a146s mouth. He turned it over to expose the central page. \a147Here it is, and with your permission I will read it to you. Listen to this, Mr. Holmes. The head-lines are. \a145Mysterious Affair at Lower Norwood. Disappearance of a Well-known Builder. Suspicion of Murder and Arson. A Clue to the Criminal.\a146 That is the clue which they are already following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that it leads infallibly to me. I have been followed from London Bridge Station, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me. It will break my mother\a146s heart\a151 it will break her heart!. He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backwards and forwards in his chair.I looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence. He was flaxen-haired and handsome in a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes and a clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His age may have been about twenty-seven; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman. From the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of endorsed papers which proclaimed his profession.\a147We must use what time we have,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Watson, would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in question?\a148Underneath the vigorous head-lines which our client had quoted I read the following suggestive narrative:\a151-Late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at Lower Norwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. Mr. Jonas Oldacre is a well-known resident of that suburb, where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years. Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor, fifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the Sydenham end of the road of that name. He has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. For some years he has practically withdrawn from the business, in which he is said to have amassed considerable wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however, at the back of the house, and last night, about twelve o\a146clock, an alarm was given that one of the stacks was on fire. The engines were soon upon the spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed. Up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident, but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime. Surprise was expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed, which showed that he had disappeared from the house. An examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that a number of important papers were scattered about the room, and, finally, that there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces of blood being found within the room, and an oaken walking-stick, which also showed stains of blood upon the handle. It is known that Mr. Jonas Oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person, who is a young London solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner of Graham and McFarlane, of 426, Gresham Buildings, E.C. The police believe that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow.LATER.\a151 It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued. There have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at Norwood. Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is on the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood-pile, and, finally, it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire. The police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to the wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime. The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to this remarkable account.\a147The case has certainly some points of interest,\a148 said he, in his languid fashion. \a147May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest?\a148\a147I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr. Holmes; but last night, having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre, I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my business from there. I knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train, when I read what you have just heard. I at once saw the horrible danger of my position, and I hurried to put the case into your hands. I have no doubt that I should have been arrested either at my City office or at my home. A man followed me from London Bridge Station, and I have no doubt\a151- Great Heaven, what is that?\a148It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair. A moment later our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway. Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside.\a147Mr. John Hector McFarlane?\a148 said Lestrade.Our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.\a147I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.\a148McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed.\a147One moment, Lestrade,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Half an hour more or less can make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair, which might aid us in clearing it up.\a148\a147I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,\a148 said Lestrade, grimly.\a147None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested to hear his account.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, and we owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147At the same time I must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him.\a148\a147I wish nothing better,\a148 said our client. \a147All I ask is that you should hear and recognise the absolute truth.\a148Lestrade looked at his watch. \a147I\a146ll give you half an hour,\a148 said he.\a147I must explain first,\a148 said McFarlane, \a147that I knew nothing of Mr. Jonas Oldacre. His name was familiar to me, for many years ago my parents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. I was very much surprised, therefore, when yesterday, about three o\a146clock in the afternoon, he walked into my office in the City. But I was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit. He had in his hand several sheets of a note-book, covered with scribbled writing\a151 here they are\a151 and he laid them on my table.\a145Here is my will,\a146 said he. \a145I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast it into proper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.\a146\a147I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when I found that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me. He was a strange little, ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and when I looked up at him I found his keen grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression. I could hardly believe my own senses as I read the terms of the will; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation, that he had known my parents in his youth, and that he had always heard of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that his money would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only stammer out my thanks. The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed by my clerk. This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I have explained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre then informed me that there were a number of documents\a151 building leases, title-deeds, mortgages, scrip, and so forth\a151 which it was necessary that I should see and understand. He said that his mind would not be easy until the whole thing was settled, and he begged me to come out to his house at Norwood that night, bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters. \a145Remember, my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until everything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for them.\a146 He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it faithfully.\a147You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to refuse him anything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. I sent a telegram home, therefore, to say that I had important business on hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how late I might be. Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine, as he might not be home before that hour. I had some difficulty in finding his house, however, and it was nearly half-past before I reached it. I found him\a151-\a147\a147One moment!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Who opened the door?\a148\a147A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.\a148\a147And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said McFarlane.\a147Pray proceed.\a148McFarlane wiped his damp brow and then continued his narrative:\a151\a147I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal supper was laid out. Afterwards Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into his bedroom, in which there stood a heavy safe. This he opened and took out a mass of documents, which we went over together. It was between eleven and twelve when we finished. He remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper. He showed me out through his own French window, which had been open all this time.\a148\a147Was the blind down?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. Yes, I remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. I could not find my stick, and he said, \a145Never mind, my boy; I shall see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back to claim it.\a146 I left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up in packets upon the table. It was so late that I could not get back to Blackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.\a148\a147Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?\a148 said Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable explanation.\a147Not until I have been to Blackheath.\a148\a147You mean to Norwood,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have meant,\a148 said Holmes, with his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously at my companion.\a147I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at the door and there is a four-wheeler waiting\a148. The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face.\a147There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?\a148 said he, pushing them over.The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.\a147I can read the first few lines, and these in the middle of the second page, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as print,\a148 said he; \a147but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three places where I cannot read it at all.\a148\a147What do you make of that?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Well, what do \iyou\i make of it?\a148\a147That it was written in a train; the good writing represents stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing passing over points. A scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line, since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points. Granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an express, only stopping once between Norwood and London Bridge.\a148Lestrade began to laugh.\a147You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147How does this bear on the case?\a148\a147Well, it corroborates the young man\a146s story to the extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is curious\a151 is it not?\a151 that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance. If a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so.\a148\a147Well, he drew up his own death-warrant at the same time,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147Oh, you think so?\a148\a147Don\a146t you?\a148\a147Well, it is quite possible; but the case is not clear to me yet.\a148\a147Not clear. Well, if that isn\a146t clear, what \icould\i be clear. Here is a young man who learns suddenly that if a certain older man dies he will succeed to a fortune. What does he do. He says nothing to anyone, but he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that night; he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed, and then in the solitude of a man\a146s room he murders him, burns his body in the wood-pile, and departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-stains in the room and also on the stick are very slight. It is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death\a151 traces which for some reason must have pointed to him. Is all this not obvious?\a148\a147It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You do not add imagination to your other great qualities; but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime. Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents. Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let you in. And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal. Confess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.\a148\a147As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a criminal is often flurried and does things which a cool man would avoid. He was very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me another theory that would fit the facts.\a148\a147I could very easily give you half-a-dozen,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Here, for example, is a very possible and even probable one. I make you a free present of it. The older man is showing documents which are of evident value. A passing tramp sees them through the window, the blind of which is only half down. Exit the solicitor. Enter the tramp. He seizes a stick, which he observes there, kills Oldacre, and departs after burning the body.\a148\a147Why should the tramp burn the body?\a148\a147For the matter of that why should McFarlane?\a148\a147To hide some evidence.\a148\a147Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed.\a148\a147And why did the tramp take nothing?\a148\a147Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.\a148Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was less absolutely assured than before.\a147Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future will show which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes\a151 that so far as we know none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them, since he was heir-at-law and would come into them in any case.\a148My friend seemed struck by this remark.\a147I don\a146t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory,\a148 said he. \a147I only wish to point out that there are other theories possible. As you say, the future will decide. Good morning. I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in at Norwood and see how you are getting on.\a148When the detective departed my friend rose and made his preparations for the day\a146s work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task before him.\a147My first movement, Watson,\a148 said he, as he bustled into his frock-coat, \a147must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath.\a148\a147And why not Norwood?\a148\a147Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident. The police are making the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second, because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal. But it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first incident\a151 the curious will, so suddenly made, and to so unexpected an heir. It may do something to simplify what followed. No, my dear fellow, I don\a146t think you can help me. There is no prospect of danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. I trust that when I see you in the evening I will be able to report that I have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster who has thrown himself upon my protection.\a148It was late when my friend returned, and I could see by a glance at his haggard and anxious face that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. At last he flung down the instrument and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures.\a147It\a146s all going wrong, Watson\a151 all as wrong as it can go. I kept a bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my instincts are one way and all the facts are the other, and I much fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade\a146s facts.\a148\a147Did you go to Blackheath?\a148\a147Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable black-guard. The father was away in search of his son. The mother was at home\a151 a little, fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. Of course, she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt. But she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of Oldacre. On the contrary, she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police, for, of course, if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion it would predispose him towards hatred and violence. \a145He was more like a malignant and cunning ape than a human being,\a146 said she, \a145and he always was, ever since he was a young man.\a146\a145You knew him at that time?\a146 said I.\a145Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. Thank Heaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better, if a poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes, when I heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing more to do with him.\a146 She rummaged in a bureau, and presently she produced a photograph of a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife. \a145That is my own photograph,\a146 she said. \a145He sent it to me in that state, with his curse, upon my wedding morning.\a146\a145Well,\a146 said I, \a145at least he has forgiven you now, since he has left all his property to your son.\a146\a145Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or alive,\a146 she cried, with a proper spirit. \a145There is a God in Heaven, Mr. Holmes, and that same God who has punished that wicked man will show in His own good time that my son\a146s hands are guiltless of his blood.\a146\a147Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. I gave it up at last and off I went to Norwood.\a147This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring brick, standing back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front of it. To the right and some distance back from the road was the timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. Here\a146s a rough plan on a leaf of my note-book. This window on the left is the one which opens into Oldacre\a146s room. You can look into it from the road, you see. That is about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was not there, but his head constable did the honours. They had just made a great treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of \a145Hyams,\a146 who was Oldacre\a146s tailor. I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. All that, of course, fits in with the official theory. I crawled about the lawn with an August sun on my back, but I got up at the end of an hour no wiser than before.\a147Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined that also. The blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolorations, but undoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed, but there also the marks were slight. There is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client. He admits it. Footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet, but none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other side. They were piling up their score all the time and we were at a standstill.\a147Only one little gleam of hope did I get\a151 and yet it amounted to nothing. I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been taken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up into sealed envelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. But it seemed to me that all the papers were not there. There were allusions to some deeds\a151 possibly the more valuable\a151 which I could not find. This, of course, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade\a146s argument against himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it?\a147Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, I tried my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name, a little, dark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. She could tell us something if she would\a151 I am convinced of it. But she was as close as wax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane in at half-past nine. She wished her hand had withered before she had done so. She had gone to bed at half-past ten. Her room was at the other end of the house, and she could hear nothing of what passed. Mr. McFarlane had left his hat, and to the best of her belief his stick, in the hall. She had been awakened by the alarm of fire. Her poor, dear master had certainly been murdered. Had he any enemies. Well, every man had enemies, but Mr. Oldacre kept himself very much to himself, and only met people in the way of business. She had seen the buttons, and was sure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night. The wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. It burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot nothing could be seen but flames. She and all the firemen smelled the burned flesh from inside it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr. Oldacre\a146s private affairs.\a147So, my dear Watson, there\a146s my report of a failure. And yet -. and yet\a151-\a148\a151 he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction\a151\a147I \iknow\i it\a146s all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There is something that has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. There was a sort of sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge. However, there\a146s no good talking any more about it, Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance Case will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which I foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure.\a148\a147Surely,\a148 said I, \a147the man\a146s appearance would go far with any jury?\a148\a147That is a dangerous argument, my dear Watson. You remember that terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in \a14687. Was there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young man?\a148\a147It is true.\a148\a147Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory this man is lost. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it. By the way, there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. On looking over the bank-book I found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to Mr. Cornelius. I confess that I should be interested to know who this Mr. Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large transactions. Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair. Cornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large payments. Failing any other indication my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these cheques. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard.\a148I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.\a147What do you think of this, Watson?\a148 he asked, tossing it across.It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:\a151\a147IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND. MCFARLANE\a146S GUILT DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED. ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE.\a151 LESTRADE.\a148\a147This sounds serious,\a148 said I.\a147It is Lestrade\a146s little cock-a-doodle of victory,\a148 Holmes answered, with a bitter smile. \a147And yet it may be premature to abandon the case. After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade imagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and your moral support to-day.\a148My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. \a147At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,\a148 he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet. Have you found your tramp?\a148 he cried.\a147I have formed no conclusion whatever,\a148 my companion answered.\a147But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,\a148 said Holmes.Lestrade laughed loudly.\a147You don\a146t like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,\a148 said he. \a147A man can\a146t expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson. Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime.\a148He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.\a147This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done,\a148 said he. \a147Now, look at this\a148. With dramatic suddenness he struck a match and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match nearer I saw that it was more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.\a147Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Yes, I am doing so.\a148\a147You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?\a148\a147I have heard something of the kind.\a148\a147Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young McFarlane\a146s right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?\a148As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.\a147That is final,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147Yes, that is final,\a148 I involuntarily echoed.\a147It is final,\a148 said Holmes.Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. An extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.\a147Dear me. Dear me!\a148 he said at last. \a147Well, now, who would have thought it. And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure. Such a nice young man to look at. It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment, is it not, Lestrade?\a148\a147Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Lestrade. The man\a146s insolence was maddening, but we could not resent it.\a147What a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very natural action, too, if you come to think of it.\a148 Holmes was outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he spoke. \a147By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?\a148\a147It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night constable\a146s attention to it.\a148\a147Where was the night constable?\a148\a147He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so as to see that nothing was touched.\a148\a147But why didn\a146t the police see this mark yesterday?\a148\a147Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall. Besides, it\a146s not in a very prominent place, as you see.\a148\a147No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?\a148Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind. I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation.\a147I don\a146t know whether you think that McFarlane came out of gaol in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb.\a148\a147It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.\a148\a147There, that\a146s enough,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147I am a practical man, Mr. Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room.\a148Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his expression.\a147Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?\a148 said he. \a147And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client.\a148\a147I am delighted to hear it,\a148 said I, heartily. \a147I was afraid it was all up with him.\a148\a147I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance.\a148\a147Indeed, Holmes. What is it?\a148\a147Only this\a151 that I \iknow\i that that mark was not there when I examined the hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine.\a148With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden. Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it with great interest. He then led the way inside and went over the whole building from basement to attics. Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely. Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.\a147There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it.\a148The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes interrupted him.\a147I understood that you were writing a report of this case,\a148 said he.\a147So I am.\a148\a147Don\a146t you think it may be a little premature. I can\a146t help thinking that your evidence is not complete.\a148Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down his pen and looked curiously at him.\a147What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.\a148\a147Can you produce him?\a148\a147I think I can.\a148\a147Then do so.\a148\a147I will do my best. How many constables have you?\a148\a147There are three within call.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 said Holmes. \a147May I ask if they are all large, able-bodied men with powerful voices?\a148\a147I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices have to do with it.\a148\a147Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or two other things as well,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Kindly summon your men, and I will try.\a148Five minutes later three policemen had assembled in the hall.\a147In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I require. Thank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your pocket, Watson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing.\a148As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other across his features. Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.\a147Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water. Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. Now I think that we are all ready.\a148Lestrade\a146s face had begun to grow red and angry.\a147I don\a146t know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147If you know anything, you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery.\a148\a147I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of the straw?\a148I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of grey smoke swirled down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.\a147Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. Might I ask you all to join in the cry of \a145Fire!\a146. Now, then; one, two, three\a151-\a147\a147Fire!\a148 we all yelled.\a147Thank you. I will trouble you once again.\a148\a147Fire!\a148\a147Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.\a148\a147Fire!. The shout must have rung over Norwood.It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out of its burrow.\a147Capital!\a148 said Holmes, calmly. \a147Watson, a bucket of water over the straw. That will do. Lestrade, allow me to present you with your principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.\a148The detective stared at the new-comer with blank amazement. The latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering at us and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious face\a151 crafty, vicious, malignant, with shifty, light-grey eyes and white eyelashes.\a147What\a146s this, then?\a148 said Lestrade at last. \a147What have you been doing all this time, eh?\a148Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red face of the angry detective.\a147I have done no harm.\a148\a147No harm. You have done your best to get an innocent man hanged. If it wasn\a146t for this gentleman here, I am not sure that you would not have succeeded.\a148The wretched creature began to whimper.\a147I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.\a148\a147Oh! a joke, was it. You won\a146t find the laugh on your side, I promise you. Take him down and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr. Holmes,\a148 he continued, when they had gone, \a147I could not speak before the constables, but I don\a146t mind saying, in the presence of Dr. Watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, though it is a mystery to me how you did it. You have saved an innocent man\a146s life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal, which would have ruined my reputation in the Force.\a148Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder.\a147Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations in that report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.\a148\a147And you don\a146t want your name to appear?\a148\a147Not at all. The work is its own reward. Perhaps I shall get the credit also at some distant day when I permit my zealous historian to lay out his foolscap once more\a151 eh, Watson. Well, now, let us see where this rat has been lurking.\a148A lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within by slits under the eaves. A few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within, together with a number of books and papers.\a147There\a146s the advantage of being a builder,\a148 said Holmes, as we came out. \a147He was able to fix up his own little hiding-place without any confederate\a151 save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom I should lose no time in adding to your bag, Lestrade.\a148\a147I\a146ll take your advice. But how did you know of this place, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below, it was pretty clear where he was. I thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. We could, of course, have gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself; besides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, for your chaff in the morning.\a148\a147Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. But how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all?\a148\a147The thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was final; and so it was, in a very different sense. I knew it had not been there the day before. I pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have observed, and I had examined the hall and was sure that the wall was clear. Therefore, it had been put on during the night.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147Very simply. When those packets were sealed up, Jonas Oldacre got McFarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax. It would be done so quickly and so naturally that I dare say the young man himself has no recollection of it. Very likely it just so happened, and Oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it to. Brooding over the case in that den of his, it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against McFarlane by using that thumb-mark. It was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the wall during the night, either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper. If you examine among those documents which he took with him into his retreat I will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumb-mark upon it.\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 said Lestrade. \a147Wonderful. It\a146s all as clear as crystal, as you put it. But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?\a148It was amusing to me to see how the detective\a146s overbearing manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher.\a147Well, I don\a146t think that is very hard to explain. A very deep, malicious, vindictive person is the gentleman who is now awaiting us downstairs. You know that he was once refused by McFarlane\a146s mother. You don\a146t. I told you that you should go to Blackheath first and Norwood afterwards. Well, this injury, as he would consider it, has rankled in his wicked, scheming brain, and all his life he has longed for vengeance, but never seen his chance. During the last year or two things have gone against him\a151 secret speculation, I think\a151 and he finds himself in a bad way. He determines to swindle his creditors, and for this purpose he pays large cheques to a certain Mr. Cornelius, who is, I imagine, himself under another name. I have not traced these cheques yet, but I have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some provincial town where Oldacre from time to time led a double existence. He intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish, starting life again elsewhere.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s likely enough.\a148\a147It would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track, and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart, if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child. It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he carried it out like a master. The idea of the will, which would give an obvious motive for the crime, the secret visit unknown to his own parents, the retention of the stick, the blood, and the animal remains and buttons in the wood-pile, all were admirable. It was a net from which it seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape. But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop. He wished to improve that which was already perfect\a151 to draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim\a151 and so he ruined all. Let us descend, Lestrade. There are just one or two questions that I would ask him.\a148The malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a policeman upon each side of him.\a147It was a joke, my good sir, a practical joke, nothing more,\a148 he whined incessantly. \a147I assure you, sir, that I simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance, and I am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that I would have allowed any harm to befall poor young Mr. McFarlane.\a148\a147That\a146s for a jury to decide,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147Anyhow, we shall have you on a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder.\a148\a147And you\a146ll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking account of Mr. Cornelius,\a148 said Holmes.The little man started and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend.\a147I have to thank you for a good deal,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps I\a146ll pay my debt some day.\a148Holmes smiled indulgently.\a147I fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully occupied,\a148 said he. \a147By the way, what was it you put into the wood-pile besides your old trousers. A dead dog, or rabbits, or what. You won\a146t tell. Dear me, how very unkind of you. Well, well, I dare say that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes. If ever you write an account, Watson, you can make rabbits serve your turn.\a148\p\X1\BThe Dancing Men\B\X1\c\i\m="danc-02.png"\i\cHolmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull grey plumage and a black top-knot.\a147So, Watson,\a148 said he, suddenly, \a147you do not propose to invest in South African securities?\a148I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes\a146s curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable.\a147How on earth do you know that?\a148 I asked.He wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes.\a147Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,\a148 said he.\a147I am.\a148\a147I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.\a148\a147I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.\a148\a147You see, my dear Watson\a148he propped his test-tube in the rack and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class\a147it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one\a146s audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was not really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did \inot\i propose to invest your small capital in the goldfields.\a148\a147I see no connection.\a148\a147Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here are the missing links of the very simple chain:1. You had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.2. You put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue.3. You never play billiards except with Thurston.4. You told me four weeks ago that Thurston had an option on some South African property which would expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him.5. Your cheque-book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner.\a148\a147How absurdly simple!\a148 I cried.\a147Quite so!\a148 said he, a little nettled. \a147Every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you. Here is an unexplained one. See what you can make of that, friend Watson.\a148 He tossed a sheet of paper upon the table and turned once more to his chemical analysis.I looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.\a147Why, Holmes, it is a child\a146s drawing,\a148 I cried.\a147Oh, that\a146s your idea!\a148\a147What else should it be?\a148\a147That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is very anxious to know. This little conundrum came by the first post, and he was to follow by the next train. There\a146s a ring at the bell, Watson. I should not be very much surprised if this were he.\a148A heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there entered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker Street. He seemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air with him as he entered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he was about to sit down when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings, which I had just examined and left upon the table.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?\a148 he cried. \a147They told me that you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don\a146t think you can find a queerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead so that you might have time to study it before I came.\a148\a147It is certainly rather a curious production,\a148 said Holmes. \a147At first sight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn. Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object?\a148\a147I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is frightening her to death. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That\a146s why I want to sift the matter to the bottom.\a148Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a note-book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way:\c\i\m="danc-1i.png"\i\cHolmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he placed it in his pocket-book.\a147This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,\a148 said he. \a147You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.\a148\a147I\a146m not much of a story-teller,\a148 said our visitor, nervously clasping and unclasping his great, strong hands. \a147You\a146ll just ask me anything that I don\a146t make clear. I\a146ll begin at the time of my marriage last year; but I want to say first of all that, though I\a146m not a rich man, my people have been at Ridling Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and there is no better known family in the County of Norfolk. Last year I came up to London for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in Russell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in it. There was an American young lady there\a151 Patrick was the name\a151 Elsie Patrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was up I was as much in love as a man could be. We were quietly married at a registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. You\a146ll think it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her people; but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand.\a147She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can\a146t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. \a145I have had some very disagreeable associations in my life,\a146 said she; \a145I wish to forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for it is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of; but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these conditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me\a148. It was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was content to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my word.\a147Well, we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been. But about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time signs of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from America. I saw the American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made none, for a promise is a promise; but she has never known an easy hour from that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face\a151 a look as if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me. She would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks I can say nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in England who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it well, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring any stain upon it\a151 of that I am sure.\a147Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week ago\a151 it was the Tuesday of last week\a151 I found on one of the window-sills a number of absurd little dancing figures, like these upon the paper. They were scrawled with chalk. I thought that it was the stable-boy who had drawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. Anyhow, they had come there during the night. I had them washed out, and I only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards. To my surprise she took it very seriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did come for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on the sun-dial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped in a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half dazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. It was then that I wrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was not a thing that I could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you will tell me what to do. I am not a rich man; but if there is any danger threatening my little woman I would spend my last copper to shield her.\a148He was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil, simple, straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad, comely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features. Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention, and now he sat for some time in silent thought.\a147Don\a146t you think, Mr. Cubitt,\a148 said he, at last, \a147that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share her secret with you?\a148Hilton Cubitt shook his massive head.\a147A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to tell me she would. If not, it is not for me to force her confidence. But I am justified in taking my own line\a151 and I will.\a148\a147Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause comment?\a148\a147In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small watering-places not very far away. And the farmers take in lodgers.\a148\a147These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on the other hand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it. But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk, that you keep a keen look-out, and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence come to me again. That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt. If there are any pressing fresh developments I shall be always ready to run down and see you in your Norfolk home.\a148The interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times in the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his note-book and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. He made no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight or so later. I was going out when he called me back.\a147You had better stay here, Watson.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning\a151 you remember Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men. He was to reach Liverpool Street at one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance.\a148We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.\a147It\a146s getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, as he sank, like a wearied man, into an arm-chair. \a147It\a146s bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of design upon you; but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure. She\a146s wearing away under it\a151 just wearing away before my eyes.\a148\a147Has she said anything yet?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge. I have tried to help her; but I dare say I did it clumsily, and scared her off from it. She has spoken about my old family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour, and I always felt it was leading to the point; but somehow it turned off before we got there.\a148\a147But you have found out something for yourself?\a148\a147A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dancing men pictures for you to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow.\a148\a147What, the man who draws them?\a148\a147Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order. When I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and here it is\a148. He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. Here is a copy of the hieroglyphics:\a151\c\i\m="danc-2i.png"\i\c\a147Excellent!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Excellent. Pray continue.\a148\a147When I had taken the copy I rubbed out the marks; but two mornings later a fresh inscription had appeared. I have a copy of it here\a148:\a151\c\i\m="danc-3i.png"\i\cHolmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight.\a147Our material is rapidly accumulating,\a148 said he.\a147Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed under a pebble upon the sun-dial. Here it is. The characters are, as you see, exactly the same as the last one. After that I determined to lie in wait; so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks the lawn and garden. About two in the morning I was seated by the window, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard steps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown. She implored me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us. She answered that it was some senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of it.\a145If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I, and so avoid this nuisance.\a146\a147What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?\a148 said I. \a147Why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.\a148\a145Well, come to bed,\a146 said she, \a145and we can discuss it in the morning.\a146\a147Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something was moving in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my pistol I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to me most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which I have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the door again in the morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which I had already seen.\a148\a147Have you that fresh drawing?\a148\a147Yes; it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is.\a148Again he produced a paper. The new dance was in this form:\a151\c\i\m="danc-4i.png"\i\c\a147Tell me,\a148 said Holmes\a151 and I could see by his eyes that he was much excited\a147was this a mere addition to the first, or did it appear to be entirely separate?\a148\a147It was on a different panel of the door.\a148\a147Excellent. This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It fills me with hopes. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most interesting statement.\a148\a147I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the skulking rascal. She said that she feared that I might come to harm. For an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that \ihe\i might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who this man was and what he meant by these strange signals. But there is a tone in my wife\a146s voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind. There\a146s the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I ought to do. My own inclination is to put half-a-dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.\a148\a147I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,\a148 said Holmes. \a147How long can you stay in London?\a148\a147I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for anything. She is very nervous and begged me to come back.\a148\a147I dare say you are right. But if you could have stopped I might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile you will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case.\a148Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see that he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt\a146s broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table, laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him, and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form. \a147If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147I expect that we shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow, and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.\a148I confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way; so I waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.But there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of impatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell. On the evening of the second there came a letter from Hilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sun-dial. He enclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced:\a151\c\i\m="danc-8i.png"\i\cHolmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. His face was haggard with anxiety.\a147We have let this affair go far enough,\a148 said he. \a147Is there a train to North Walsham to-night?\a148I turned up the time-table. The last had just gone.\a147Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our expected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson; there may be an answer. No, that is quite as I expected. This message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how matters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple Norfolk squire is entangled.\a148So, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre I experience once again the dismay and horror with which I was filled. Would that I had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the chronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made Ridling Thorpe Manor a household word through the length and breadth of England.We had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and mentioned the name of our destination, when the station-master hurried towards us. \a147I suppose that you are the detectives from London?\a148 said he.A look of annoyance passed over Holmes\a146s face.\a147What makes you think such a thing?\a148\a147Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has just passed through. But maybe you are the surgeons. She\a146s not dead\a151 or wasn\a146t by last accounts. You may be in time to save her yet\a151 though it be for the gallows.\a148Holmes\a146s brow was dark with anxiety.\a147We are going to Ridling Thorpe Manor,\a148 said he, \a147but we have heard nothing of what has passed there.\a148\a147It\a146s a terrible business,\a148 said the station-master. \a147They are shot, both Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shot him and then herself\a151 so the servants say. He\a146s dead and her life is despaired of. Dear, dear, one of the oldest families in the County of Norfolk, and one of the most honoured.\a148Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven miles\a146 drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so utterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our journey from town, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention; but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy. He leaned back in his seat, lost in gloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we were passing through as singular a country-side as any in England, where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on every hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat, green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia. At last the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over the green edge of the Norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. \a147That\a146s Ridling Thorpe Manor,\a148 said he.As we drove up to the porticoed front door I observed in front of it, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sun-dial with which we had such strange associations. A dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just descended from a high dog-cart. He introduced himself as Inspector Martin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion.\a147Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning. How could you hear of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?\a148\a147I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.\a148\a147Then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant, for they were said to be a most united couple.\a148\a147I have only the evidence of the dancing men,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I will explain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to prevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge which I possess in order to ensure that justice be done. Will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act independently?\a148\a147I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said the inspector, earnestly.\a147In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.\a148Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the results. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt\a146s room, and he reported that her injuries were serious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed through the front of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself he would not venture to express any decided opinion. Certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had been emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that she had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them.\a147Has he been moved?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor.\a148\a147How long have you been here, doctor?\a148\a147Since four o\a146clock.\a148\a147Anyone else?\a148\a147Yes, the constable here.\a148\a147And you have touched nothing?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?\a148\a147The housemaid, Saunders.\a148\a147Was it she who gave the alarm?\a148\a147She and Mrs. King, the cook.\a148\a147Where are they now?\a148\a147In the kitchen, I believe.\a148\a147Then I think we had better hear their story at once.\a148The old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a court of investigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. I could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin, the old, grey-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company.The two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed a minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs. King had rushed in to Saunders. Together they had descended the stairs. The door of the study was open and a candle was burning upon the table. Their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. He was quite dead. Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against the wall. She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red with blood. She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything. The passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of powder. The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both women were positive upon the point. They had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the stable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. Both she and her husband had occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress\a151 he in his dressing-gown, over his night clothes. Nothing had been moved in the study. So far as they knew there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife. They had always looked upon them as a very united couple.These were the main points of the servants\a146 evidence. In answer to Inspector Martin they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. In answer to Holmes they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor. \a147I commend that fact very carefully to your attention,\a148 said Holmes to his professional colleague. \a147And now I think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room.\a148The study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books, and with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out upon the garden. Our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. His disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep. The bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in his body after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly been instantaneous and painless. There was no powder-marking either upon his dressing-gown or on his hands. According to the country surgeon the lady had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand.\a147The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may mean everything,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Unless the powder from a badly-fitting cartridge happens to spurt backwards, one may fire many shots without leaving a sign. I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt\a146s body may now be removed. I suppose, doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady?\a148\a147A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. But there are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and two wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.\a148\a147So it would seem,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?\a148He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window-sash about an inch above the bottom.\a147By George!\a148 cried the inspector. \a147How ever did you see that?\a148\a147Because I looked for it.\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 said the country doctor. \a147You are certainly right, sir. Then a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have been present. But who could that have been and how could he have got away?\a148\a147That is the problem which we are now about to solve,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder I remarked that the point was an extremely important one?\a148\a147Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you.\a148\a147It suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well as the door of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was necessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short time, however.\a148\a147How do you prove that?\a148\a147Because the candle has not guttered.\a148\a147Capital!\a148 cried the inspector. \a147Capital!\a148\a147Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy I conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who stood outside this opening and fired through it. Any shot directed at this person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was the bullet mark!\a148\a147But how came the window to be shut and fastened?\a148\a147The woman\a146s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. But, halloa! what is this?\a148It was a lady\a146s hand-bag which stood upon the study table\a151 a trim little hand-bag of crocodile-skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned the contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of England, held together by an India-rubber band\a151 nothing else.\a147This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial,\a148 said Holmes, as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. \a147It is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet, which has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from inside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. You said, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a \iloud\i explosion. When you said that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one?\a148\a147Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, and so it is hard to judge. But it did seem very loud.\a148\a147You don\a146t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant?\a148\a147I am sure I couldn\a146t say, sir.\a148\a147I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin, that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer.\a148A flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it. The flowers were trampled down, and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Large, masculine feet they were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with a cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder.\a147I thought so,\a148 said he; \a147the revolver had an ejector, and here is the third cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is almost complete.\a148The country inspector\a146s face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of Holmes\a146s investigation. At first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position; but now he was overcome with admiration and ready to follow without question wherever Holmes led.\a147Whom do you suspect?\a148 he asked.\a147I\a146ll go into that later. There are several points in this problem which I have not been able to explain to you yet. Now that I have got so far I had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up once and for all.\a148\a147Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man.\a148\a147I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations. I have the threads of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady should never recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night and ensure that justice be done. First of all I wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as \a145Elrige\a146s\a146?\a148The servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a place. The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off in the direction of East Ruston.\a147Is it a lonely farm?\a148\a147Very lonely, sir.\a148\a147Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night?\a148\a147Maybe not, sir.\a148Holmes thought for a little and then a curious smile played over his face.\a147Saddle a horse, my lad,\a148 said he. \a147I shall wish you to take a note to Elrige\a146s Farm.\a148He took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these in front of him he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he handed a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of the note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike Holmes\a146s usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elrige\a146s Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk.\a147I think, inspector,\a148 Holmes remarked, \a147that you would do well to telegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol. The boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close.\a148When the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave his instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to call asking for Mrs. Hilton Cubitt no information should be given as to her condition, but he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way into the drawing-room with the remark that the business was now out of our hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his patients, and only the inspector and myself remained.\a147I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner,\a148 said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men. \a147As to you, friend Watson, I owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied. To you, inspector, the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study. I must tell you first of all the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker Street\a148. He then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. \a147I have here in front of me these singular productions, at which one might smile had they not proved themselves to be the fore-runners of so terrible a tragedy. I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers; but I confess that this is entirely new to me. The object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children.\a147Having once recognised, however, that the symbols stood for letters, and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say with some confidence that the symbol \m="danc-6is.png" stood for E. As you are aware, E is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E. It is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag and in some cases not, but it was probable from the way in which the flags were distributed that they were used to break the sentence up into words. I accepted this as a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by.\c\i\m="danc-6i.png"\i\c\a147But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of the English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur; but T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at. I, therefore, waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message, which appeared\a151 since there was no flag\a151 to be a single word. Here are the symbols:\c\i\m="danc-4i.png"\i\cNow, in the single word I have already got the two E\a146s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might be \a145sever,\a146 or \a145lever,\a146 or \a145never.\a146 There can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady. Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols\c\i\m="danc-5i.png"\i\cstand respectively for N, V, and R.\a147Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters. It occurred to me that if these appeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life, a combination which contained two E\a146s with three letters between might very well stand for the name \a145ELSIE.\a146 On examination I found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal to \a145Elsie.\a146 In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could it be. There were only four letters in the word which preceded \a145Elsie,\a146 and it ended in E. Surely the word must be \a145COME.\a146 I tried all other four letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case. So now I was in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the first message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown. So treated it worked out in this fashion:\c\i.. .ER. \a133 SL.NE.\i\c\a147Now the first letter \ican\i only be A, which is a most useful discovery, since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and the H is also apparent in the second word. Now it becomes:\c\iA. HER. A.. SLANE.\i\cOr, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:\c\iA. HER. AB. SLANEY.\i\cI had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion:\c\iA. ELRI.ES.\i\cHere I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters, and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying.\a148Inspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties.\a147What did you do then, sir?\a148 asked the inspector.\a147I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American, since Abe is an American contraction, and since a letter from America had been the starting-point of all the trouble. I had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. The lady\a146s allusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence both pointed in that direction. I therefore cabled to my friend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New York Police Bureau, who has more than once made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether the name of Abe Slaney was known to him. Here is his reply. \a145The most dangerous crook in Chicago.\a146 On the very evening upon which I had his answer Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney. Working with known letters it took this form:\c\iELSI. .RE.AR. T. MEE. TH. GO.\i\cThe addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of the crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action. I at once came to Norfolk with my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the worst had already occurred.\a148\a147It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,\a148 said the inspector, warmly. \a147You will excuse me, however, if I speak frankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to answer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige\a146s, is indeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated here, I should certainly get into serious trouble.\a148\a147You need not be uneasy. He will not try to escape.\a148\a147How do you know?\a148\a147To fly would be a confession of guilt.\a148\a147Then let us go to arrest him.\a148\a147I expect him here every instant.\a148\a147But why should he come?\a148\a147Because I have written and asked him.\a148\a147But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes. Why should he come because you have asked him. Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly?\a148\a147I think I have known how to frame the letter,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive.\a148A man was striding up the path which led to the door. He was a tall, handsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of grey flannel, with a Panama hat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and flourishing a cane as he walked. He swaggered up the path as if the place belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the bell.\a147I think, gentlemen,\a148 said Holmes, quietly, \a147that we had best take up our position behind the door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, inspector. You can leave the talking to me.\a148We waited in silence for a minute\a151 one of those minutes which one can never forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head and Martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a bitter laugh.\a147Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. I seem to have knocked up against something hard. But I came here in answer to a letter from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don\a146t tell me that she is in this. Don\a146t tell me that she helped to set a trap for me?\a148\a147Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured and is at death\a146s door.\a148The man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang through the house.\a147You\a146re crazy!\a148 he cried, fiercely. \a147It was he that was hurt, not she. Who would have hurt little Elsie. I may have threatened her, God forgive me, but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. Take it back\a151 you. Say that she is not hurt!\a148\a147She was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband.\a148He sank with a deep groan on to the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face once more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair.\a147I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,\a148 said he. \a147If I shot the man he had his shot at me, and there\a146s no murder in that. But if you think I could have hurt that woman, then you don\a146t know either me or her. I tell you there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than I loved her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to me years ago. Who was this Englishman that he should come between us. I tell you that I had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own.\a148\a147She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are,\a148 said Holmes, sternly. \a147She fled from America to avoid you, and she married an honourable gentleman in England. You dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom she feared and hated. You have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this business, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.\a148\a147If Elsie dies I care nothing what becomes of me,\a148 said the American. He opened one of his hands and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm. \a147See here, mister, he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes, \a147you\a146re not trying to scare me over this, are you. If the lady is hurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?\a148 He tossed it forwards on to the table.\a147I wrote it to bring you here.\a148\a147You wrote it. There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the secret of the dancing men. How came you to write it?\a148\a147What one man can invent another can discover,\a148 said Holmes. There is a cab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But, meanwhile, you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought. Are you aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence here and the knowledge which I happened to possess which has saved her from the accusation. The least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for his tragic end.\a148\a147I ask nothing better,\a148 said the American. \a147I guess the very best case I can make for myself is the absolute naked truth.\a148\a147It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,\a148 cried the inspector, with the magnificent fair-play of the British criminal law.Slaney shrugged his shoulders.\a147I\a146ll chance that,\a148 said he. \a147First of all, I want you gentlemen to understand that I have known this lady since she was a child. There were seven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie\a146s father was the boss of the Joint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that writing, which would pass as a child\a146s scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways; but she couldn\a146t stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London. She had been engaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken over another profession; but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I was able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer. After that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages where she could read them.\a147Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where I had a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the wiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew that she read the messages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. Then my temper got the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She sent me a letter then, imploring me to go away and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband. She said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave her in peace. She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe me to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window. At that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were face to face. I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the same instant, and down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as I went I heard the window shut behind me. That\a146s God\a146s truth, gentlemen, every word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give myself into your hands.\a148A cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two uniformed policemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder.\a147It is time for us to go.\a148\a147Can I see her first?\a148\a147No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever again I have an important case I shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.\a148We stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I turned back my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table. It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him.\a147See if you can read it, Watson,\a148 said he, with a smile.It contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:\a151\c\i\m="danc-9i.png"\i\c\a147If you use the code which I have explained,\a148 said Holmes, \a147you will find that it simply means \a145Come here at once.\a146 I was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear Watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your note-book. Three-forty is our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.Only one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was condemned to death at the winter assizes at Norwich; but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the certainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton Cubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that she still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband\a146s estate.\p\X1\BThe Solitary Cyclist\B\X1\c\i\m="soli-06.png"\i\cFrom the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive Mr. Sherlock Holmes was a very busy man. It is safe to say that there was no public case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years, and there were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent part. Many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of continuous work. As I have preserved very full notes of all these cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them, it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which I should select to lay before the public. I shall, however, preserve my former rule, and give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution. For this reason I will now lay before the reader the facts connected with Miss Violet Smith, the solitary cyclist of Charlington, and the curious sequel of our investigation, which culminated in unexpected tragedy. It is true that the circumstances did not admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was famous, but there were some points about the case which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather the material for these little narratives.On referring to my note-book for the year 1895 I find that it was upon Saturday, the 23rd of April, that we first heard of Miss Violet Smith. Her visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent Harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. My friend, who loved above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. And yet without a harshness which was foreign to his nature it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly, who presented herself at Baker Street late in the evening and implored his assistance and advice. It was vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied, for the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story, and it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so. With a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her.\a147At least it cannot be your health,\a148 said he, as his keen eyes darted over her; \a147so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.\a148She glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the pedal.\a147Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and that has something to do with my visit to you to-day.\a148My friend took the lady\a146s ungloved hand and examined it with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen.\a147You will excuse me, I am sure. It is my business,\a148 said he, as he dropped it. \a147I nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting. Of course, it is obvious that it is music. You observe the spatulate finger-end, Watson, which is common to both professions. There is a spirituality about the face, however\a148he gently turned it towards the light\a147which the typewriter does not generate. This lady is a musician.\a148\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music.\a148\a147In the country, I presume, from your complexion.\a148\a147Yes, sir; near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey.\a148\a147A beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting associations. You remember, Watson, that it was near there that we took Archie Stamford, the forger. Now, Miss Violet, what has happened to you near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?\a148The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following curious statement:\a151\a147My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James Smith, who conducted the orchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. My mother and I were left without a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph Smith, who went to Africa twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word from him since. When father died we were left very poor, but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in \iThe Times\i inquiring for our whereabouts. You can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone had left us a fortune. We went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper. There we met two gentlemen, Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, who were home on a visit from South Africa. They said that my uncle was a friend of theirs, that he died some months before in great poverty in Johannesburg, and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want. It seemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took no notice of us when he was alive, should be so careful to look after us when he was dead; but Mr. Carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother, and so felt responsible for our fate.\a148\a147Excuse me,\a148 said Holmes; \a147when was this interview?\a148\a147Last December\a151 four months ago.\a148\a147Pray proceed.\a148\a147Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. He was for ever making eyes at me\a151 a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. I thought that he was perfectly hateful\a151 and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to know such a person.\a148\a147Oh, Cyril is his name!\a148 said Holmes, smiling.The young lady blushed and laughed.\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how \idid\i I get talking about him. What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was a much older man, was more agreeable. He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person; but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile. He inquired how we were left, and on finding that we were very poor he suggested that I should come and teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. I said that I did not like to leave my mother, on which he suggested that I should go home to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was certainly splendid pay. So it ended by my accepting, and I went down to Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farnham. Mr. Carruthers was a widower, but he had engaged a lady-housekeeper, a very respectable, elderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after his establishment. The child was a dear, and everything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. Every week-end I went home to my mother in town.\a147The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-moustached Mr. Woodley. He came for a visit of a week, and oh, it seemed three months to me. He was a dreadful person, a bully to everyone else, but to me something infinitely worse. He made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth, said that if I married him I would have the finest diamonds in London, and finally, when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized me in his arms one day after dinner\a151 he was hideously strong\a151 and he swore that he would not let me go until I had kissed him. Mr. Carruthers came in and tore him off from me, on which he turned upon his own host, knocking him down and cutting his face open. That was the end of his visit, as you can imagine. Mr. Carruthers apologized to me next day, and assured me that I should never be exposed to such an insult again. I have not seen Mr. Woodley since.\a147And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the special thing which has caused me to ask your advice to-day. You must know that every Saturday forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station in order to get the 12.22 to town. The road from Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between Charlington Heath upon one side and the woods which lie round Charlington Hall upon the other. You could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a peasant, until you reach the high road near Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks ago I was passing this place when I chanced to look back over my shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a man, also on a bicycle. He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. I looked back before I reached Farnham, but the man was gone, so I thought no more about it. But you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes, when on my return on the Monday I saw the same man on the same stretch of road. My astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again, exactly as before, on the following Saturday and Monday. He always kept his distance and did not molest me in any way, but still it certainly was very odd. I mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers, who seemed interested in what I said, and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap, so that in future I should not pass over these lonely roads without some companion.\a147The horse and trap were to have come this week, but for some reason they were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to the station. That was this morning. You can think that I looked out when I came to Charlington Heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he had been the two weeks before. He always kept so far from me that I could not clearly see his face, but it was certainly someone whom I did not know. He was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. The only thing about his face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. To-day I was not alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my machine, but he slowed down his. Then I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then I laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of the road, and I pedalled very quickly round this, and then I stopped and waited. I expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. But he never appeared. Then I went back and looked round the corner. I could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. To make it the more extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone.\a148Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \a147This case certainly presents some features of its own,\a148 said he. \a147How much time elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?\a148\a147Two or three minutes.\a148\a147Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there are no side roads?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other.\a148\a147It could not have been on the side of the heath or I should have seen him.\a148\a147So by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards Charlington Hall, which, as I understand, is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road. Anything else?\a148\a147Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I should not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice.\a148Holmes sat in silence for some little time.\a147Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?\a148 he asked, at last.\a147He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry.\a148\a147He would not pay you a surprise visit?\a148\a147Oh, Mr. Holmes. As if I should not know him!\a148\a147Have you had any other admirers?\a148\a147Several before I knew Cyril.\a148\a147And since?\a148\a147There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him an admirer.\a148\a147No one else?\a148Our fair client seemed a little confused.\a147Who was he?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has seemed to me sometimes that my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me. We are thrown rather together. I play his accompaniments in the evening. He has never said anything. He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always knows.\a148\a147Ha!. Holmes looked grave. \a147What does he do for a living?\a148\a147He is a rich man.\a148\a147No carriages or horses?\a148\a147Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he goes into the City two or three times a week. He is deeply interested in South African gold shares.\a148\a147You will let me know any fresh development, Miss Smith. I am very busy just now, but I will find time to make some inquiries into your case. In the meantime take no step without letting me know. Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you.\a148\a147It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should have followers,\a148 said Holmes, as he pulled at his meditative pipe, \a147but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some secretive lover, beyond all doubt. But there are curious and suggestive details about the case, Watson.\a148\a147That he should appear only at that point?\a148\a147Exactly. Our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of Charlington Hall. Then, again, how about the connection between Carruthers and Woodley, since they appear to be men of such a different type. How came they \iboth\i to be so keen upon looking up Ralph Smith\a146s relations. One more point. What sort of a \im\a233nage\i is it which pays double the market price for a governess, but does not keep a horse although six miles from the station. Odd, Watson\a151 very odd!\a148\a147You will go down?\a148\a147No, my dear fellow, \iyou\i will go down. This may be some trifling intrigue, and I cannot break my other important research for the sake of it. On Monday you will arrive early at Farnham; you will conceal yourself near Charlington Heath; you will observe these facts for yourself, and act as your own judgment advises. Then, having inquired as to the occupants of the Hall, you will come back to me and report. And now, Watson, not another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping-stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution.\a148We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught the 9.13. At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in being directed to Charlington Heath. It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady\a146s adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees. There was a main gateway of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems; but besides this central carriage drive I observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. The house was invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay.The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one of these clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. It had been deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which I had come. He was clad in a dark suit, and I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the Charlington grounds he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge, disappearing from my view.A quarter of an hour passed and then a second cyclist appeared. This time it was the young lady coming from the station. I saw her look about her as she came to the Charlington hedge. An instant later the man emerged from his hiding-place, sprang upon his cycle, and followed her. In all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures, the graceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine, and the man behind her bending low over his handle-bar, with a curiously furtive suggestion in every movement. She looked back at him and slowed her pace. He slowed also. She stopped. He at once stopped too, keeping two hundred yards behind her. Her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited. She suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him. He was as quick as she, however, and darted off in desperate flight. Presently she came back up the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning to take any further notice of her silent attendant. He had turned also, and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my sight.I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I did so, for presently the man reappeared cycling slowly back. He turned in at the Hall gates and dismounted from his machine. For some few minutes I could see him standing among the trees. His hands were raised and he seemed to be settling his necktie. Then he mounted his cycle and rode away from me down the drive towards the Hall. I ran across the heath and peered through the trees. Far away I could catch glimpses of the old grey building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man.However, it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good morning\a146s work, and I walked back in high spirits to Farnham. The local house-agent could tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and referred me to a well-known firm in Pall Mall. There I halted on my way home, and met with courtesy from the representative. No, I could not have Charlington Hall for the summer. I was just too late. It had been let about a month ago. Mr. Williamson was the name of the tenant. He was a respectable elderly gentleman. The polite agent was afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss.Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which I was able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that word of curt praise which I had hoped for and should have valued. On the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he commented upon the things that I had done and the things that I had not.\a147Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very faulty. You should have been behind the hedge; then you would have had a close view of this interesting person. As it is you were some hundreds of yards away, and can tell me even less than Miss Smith. She thinks she does not know the man; I am convinced she does. Why, otherwise, should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features. You describe him as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment again, you see. You really have done remarkably badly. He returns to the house and you want to find out who he is. You come to a London house-agent!\a148\a147What should I have done?\a148 I cried, with some heat.\a147Gone to the nearest public-house. That is the centre of country gossip. They would have told you every name, from the master to the scullery-maid. Williamson. It conveys nothing to my mind. If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that athletic young lady\a146s pursuit. What have we gained by your expedition. The knowledge that the girl\a146s story is true. I never doubted it. That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall. I never doubted that either. That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who\a146s the better for that. Well, well, my dear sir, don\a146t look so depressed. We can do little more until next Saturday, and in the meantime I may make one or two inquiries myself.\a148Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting shortly and accurately the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the letter lay in the postscript:\a151\a147I am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr. Holmes, when I tell you that my place here has become difficult owing to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me. I am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable. At the same time my promise is, of course, given. He took my refusal very seriously, but also very gently. You can understand, however, that the situation is a little strained.\a148\a147Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters,\a148 said Holmes, thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. \a147The case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than I had originally thought. I should be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the country, and I am inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which I have formed.\a148Holmes\a146s quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for he arrived at Baker Street late in the evening with a cut lip and a discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object of a Scotland Yard investigation. He was immensely tickled by his own adventures, and laughed heartily as he recounted them.\a147I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat,\a148 said he. \a147You are aware that I have some proficiency in the good old British sport of boxing. Occasionally it is of service. To-day, for example, I should have come to very ignominious grief without it.\a148I begged him to tell me what had occurred.\a147I found that country pub which I had already recommended to your notice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. I was in the bar, and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the Hall. There is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman; but one or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical. I have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency, and they tell me that there \iwas\i a man of that name in orders whose career has been a singularly dark one. The landlord further informed me that there are usually week-end visitors\a151\a145a warm lot, sir\a146\a151 at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a red moustache, Mr. Woodley by name, who was always there. We had got as far as this when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been drinking his beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole conversation. Who was I. What did I want. What did I mean by asking questions. He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious back-hander which I failed to entirely avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart. So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my day on the Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own.\a148The Thursday brought us another letter from our client.\a147You will not be surprised, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said she, \a147to hear that I am leaving Mr. Carruthers\a146s employment. Even the high pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation. On Saturday I come up to town and I do not intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has got a trap, and so the dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers, are now over.\a147As to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the strained situation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the reappearance of that odious man, Mr. Woodley. He was always hideous, but he looks more awful than ever now, for he appears to have had an accident and he is much disfigured. I saw him out of the window, but I am glad to say I did not meet him. He had a long talk with Mr. Carruthers, who seemed much excited afterwards. Woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood, for he did not sleep here, and yet I caught a glimpse of him again this morning slinking about in the shrubbery. I would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place. I loathe and fear him more than I can say. How \ican\i Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature for a moment. However, all my troubles will be over on Saturday.\a148\a147So I trust, Watson; so I trust,\a148 said Holmes, gravely. \a147There is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey. I think, Watson, that we must spare time to run down together on Saturday morning, and make sure that this curious and inconclusive investigation has no untoward ending.\a148I confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of the case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous. That a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if he had so little audacity that he not only dared not address her, but even fled from her approach, he was not a very formidable assailant. The ruffian Woodley was a very different person, but, except on one occasion, he had not molested our client, and now he visited the house of Carruthers without intruding upon her presence. The man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken; but who he was or what he wanted was as obscure as ever. It was the severity of Holmes\a146s manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the heath-covered country-side with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and drabs and slate-greys of London. Holmes and I walked along the broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring. From a rise of the road on the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still younger than the building which they surrounded. Holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods. Far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle moving in our direction. Holmes gave an exclamation of impatience.\a147I had given a margin of half an hour,\a148 said he. \a147If that is her trap she must be making for the earlier train. I fear, Watson, that she will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her.\a148From the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see the vehicle, but we hastened onwards at such a pace that my sedentary life began to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall behind. Holmes, however, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw. His springy step never slowed until suddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he halted, and I saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair. At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us.\a147Too late, Watson; too late!\a148 cried Holmes, as I ran panting to his side. \a147Fool that I was not to allow for that earlier train! It\a146s abduction, Watson\a151 abduction. Murder. Heaven knows what. Block the road. Stop the horse. That\a146s right. Now, jump in, and let us see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder.\a148We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse, gave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back along the road. As we turned the curve the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the heath was opened up. I grasped Holmes\a146s arm.\a147That\a146s the man!\a148 I gasped.A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His head was down and his shoulders rounded as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to the pedals. He was flying like a racer. Suddenly he raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and pulled up, springing from his machine. That coal-black beard was in singular contrast to the pallor of his face, and his eyes were as bright as if he had a fever. He stared at us and at the dog-cart. Then a look of amazement came over his face.\a147Halloa. Stop there!\a148 he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our road. \a147Where did you get that dog-cart. Pull up, man!\a148 he yelled, drawing a pistol from his side pocket. \a147Pull up, I say, or, by George, I\a146ll put a bullet into your horse.\a148Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart.\a147You\a146re the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet Smith?\a148 he said, in his quick, clear way.\a147That\a146s what I am asking you. You\a146re in her dog-cart. You ought to know where she is.\a148\a147We met the dog-cart on the road. There was no one in it. We drove back to help the young lady.\a148\a147Good Lord. Good Lord! what shall I do?\a148 cried the stranger, in an ecstasy of despair. \a147They\a146ve got her, that hellhound Woodley and the blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you really are her friend. Stand by me and we\a146ll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington Wood.\a148He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge. Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside the road, followed Holmes.\a147This is where they came through,\a148 said he, pointing to the marks of several feet upon the muddy path. \a147Halloa. Stop a minute. Who\a146s this in the bush?\a148It was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters. He lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a terrible cut upon his head. He was insensible, but alive. A glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone.\a147That\a146s Peter, the groom,\a148 cried the stranger. \a147He drove her. The beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him. Let him lie; we can\a146t do him any good, but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.\a148We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. We had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when Holmes pulled up.\a147They didn\a146t go to the house. Here are their marks on the left\a151 here, beside the laurel bushes. Ah, I said so!\a148As he spoke a woman\a146s shrill scream\a151 a scream which vibrated with a frenzy of horror\a151 burst from the thick green clump of bushes in front of us. It ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and a gurgle.\a147This way. This way. They are in the bowling alley,\a148 cried the stranger, darting through the bushes. \a147Ah, the cowardly dogs. Follow me, gentlemen. Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!\a148We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by ancient trees. On the farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three people. One was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite her stood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs parted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding-crop, his whole attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado. Between them an elderly, grey-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit, had evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his prayer-book as we appeared and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation.\a147They\a146re married!\a148 I gasped.\a147Come on!\a148 cried our guide; \a147come on!. He rushed across the glade, Holmes and I at his heels. As we approached, the lady staggered against the trunk of the tree for support. Williamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed to us with mock politeness, and the bully Woodley advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant laughter.\a147You can take your beard off, Bob,\a148 said he. \a147I know you right enough. Well, you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to Mrs. Woodley.\a148Our guide\a146s answer was a singular one. He snatched off the dark beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous riding-crop swinging in his hand.\a147Yes,\a148 said our ally, \a147I \iam\i Bob Carruthers, and I\a146ll see this woman righted if I have to swing for it. I told you what I\a146d do if you molested her, and, by the Lord, I\a146ll be as good as my word!\a148\a147You\a146re too late. She\a146s my wife!\a148\a147No, she\a146s your widow.\a148His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front of Woodley\a146s waistcoat. He spun round with a scream and fell upon his back, his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor. The old man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a string of foul oaths as I have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but before he could raise it he was looking down the barrel of Holmes\a146s weapon.\a147Enough of this,\a148 said my friend, coldly. \a147Drop that pistol! Watson, pick it up. Hold it to his head. Thank you. You, Carruthers, give me that revolver. We\a146ll have no more violence. Come, hand it over!\a148\a147Who are you, then?\a148\a147My name is Sherlock Holmes.\a148\a147Good Lord!\a148\a147You have heard of me, I see. I will represent the official police until their arrival. Here, you!\a148 he shouted to a frightened groom who had appeared at the edge of the glade. \a147Come here. Take this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham.\a148 He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his note-book. \a147Give it to the superintendent at the police-station. Until he comes I must detain you all under my personal custody.\a148The strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the tragic scene, and all were equally puppets in his hands. Williamson and Carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house, and I gave my arm to the frightened girl. The injured man was laid on his bed, and at Holmes\a146s request I examined him. I carried my report to where he sat in the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before him.\a147He will live,\a148 said I.\a147What!\a148 cried Carruthers, springing out of his chair. \a147I\a146ll go upstairs and finish him first. Do you tell me that that girl, that angel, is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?\a148\a147You need not concern yourself about that,\a148 said Holmes. \a147There are two very good reasons why she should under no circumstances be his wife. In the first place, we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson\a146s right to solemnize a marriage.\a148\a147I have been ordained,\a148 cried the old rascal.\a147And also unfrocked.\a148\a147Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.\a148\a147I think not. How about the license?\a148\a147We had a license for the marriage. I have it here in my pocket.\a148\a147Then you got it by a trick. But in any case a forced marriage is no marriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you will discover before you have finished. You\a146ll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so, unless I am mistaken. As to you, Carruthers, you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.\a148\a147I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes; but when I thought of all the precaution I had taken to shield this girl\a151 for I loved her, Mr. Holmes, and it is the only time that ever I knew what love was\a151 it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in South Africa, a man whose name is a holy terror from Kimberley to Johannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes, you\a146ll hardly believe it, but ever since that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past this house, where I knew these rascals were lurking, without following her on my bicycle just to see that she came to no harm. I kept my distance from her, and I wore a beard so that she should not recognise me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl, and she wouldn\a146t have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that I was following her about the country roads.\a148\a147Why didn\a146t you tell her of her danger?\a148\a147Because then, again, she would have left me, and I couldn\a146t bear to face that. Even if she couldn\a146t love me it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house, and to hear the sound of her voice.\a148\a147Well,\a148 said I, \a147you call that love, Mr. Carruthers, but I should call it selfishness.\a148\a147Maybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I couldn\a146t let her go. Besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have someone near to look after her. Then when the cable came I knew they were bound to make a move.\a148\a147What cable?\a148Carruthers took a telegram from his pocket.\a147That\a146s it,\a148 said he.It was short and concise:\a151\a147The old man is dead.\a148\a147Hum!\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think I see how things worked, and I can understand how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. But while we wait you might tell me what you can.\a148The old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language.\a147By Heaven,\a148 said he, \a147if you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I\a146ll serve you as you served Jack Woodley. You can bleat about the girl to your heart\a146s content, for that\a146s your own affair, but if you round on your pals to this plain-clothes copper it will be the worst day\a146s work that ever you did.\a148\a147Your reverence need not be excited,\a148 said Holmes, lighting a cigarette. \a147The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details for my private curiosity. However, if there\a146s any difficulty in your telling me I\a146ll do the talking, and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets. In the first place, three of you came from South Africa on this game\a151 you Williamson, you Carruthers, and Woodley.\a148\a147Lie number one,\a148 said the old man; \a147I never saw either of them until two months ago, and I have never been in Africa in my life, so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr. Busybody Holmes!\a148\a147What he says is true,\a148 said Carruthers.\a147Well, well, two of you came over. His reverence is our own home-made article. You had known Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had reason to believe he would not live long. You found out that his niece would inherit his fortune. How\a146s that\a151 eh?\a148Carruthers nodded and Williamson swore.\a147She was next-of-kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will.\a148\a147Couldn\a146t read or write,\a148 said Carruthers.\a147So you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl. The idea was that one of you was to marry her and the other have a share of the plunder. For some reason Woodley was chosen as the husband. Why was that?\a148\a147We played cards for her on the voyage. He won.\a148\a147I see. You got the young lady into your service, and there Woodley was to do the courting. She recognised the drunken brute that he was, and would have nothing to do with him. Meanwhile, your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady. You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her.\a148\a147No, by George, I couldn\a146t!\a148\a147There was a quarrel between you. He left you in a rage, and began to make his own plans independently of you.\a148\a147It strikes me, Williamson, there isn\a146t very much that we can tell this gentleman,\a148 cried Carruthers, with a bitter laugh. \a147Yes, we quarrelled, and he knocked me down. I am level with him on that, anyhow. Then I lost sight of him. That was when he picked up with this cast padre here. I found that they had set up house-keeping together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station. I kept my eye on her after that, for I knew there was some devilry in the wind. I saw them from time to time, for I was anxious to know what they were after. Two days ago Woodley came up to my house with this cable, which showed that Ralph Smith was dead. He asked me if I would stand by the bargain. I said I would not. He asked me if I would marry the girl myself and give him a share. I said I would willingly do so, but that she would not have me. He said, \a145Let us get her married first, and after a week or two she may see things a bit different\a148. I said I would have nothing to do with violence. So he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that he was, and swearing that he would have her yet. She was leaving me this week-end, and I had got a trap to take her to the station, but I was so uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my bicycle. She had got a start, however, and before I could catch her the mischief was done. The first thing I knew about it was when I saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog-cart.\a148Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. \a147I have been very obtuse, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147When in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery, that alone should have told me all. However, we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in some respects a unique case. I perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive, and I am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them; so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently damaged by their morning\a146s adventures. I think, Watson, that in your medical capacity you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to escort her to her mother\a146s home. If she is not quite convalescent you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the Midlands would probably complete the cure. As to you, Mr. Carruthers, I think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot. There is my card, sir, and if my evidence can be of help to you in your trial it shall be at your disposal.\a148In the whirl of our incessant activity it has often been difficult for me, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my narratives, and to give those final details which the curious might expect. Each case has been the prelude to another, and the crisis once over the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives. I find, however, a short note at the end of my manuscripts dealing with this case, in which I have put it upon record that Miss Violet Smith did indeed inherit a large fortune, and that she is now the wife of Cyril Morton, the senior partner of Morton & Kennedy, the famous Westminster electricians. Williamson and Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the former getting seven years and the latter ten. Of the fate of Carruthers I have no record, but I am sure that his assault was not viewed very gravely by the Court, since Woodley had the reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian, and I think that a few months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice.\p\X1\BThe Priory School\B\X1\c\i\m="prio-04.png"\i\cWe have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at Baker Street, but I cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D., etc. His card, which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic distinctions, preceded him by a few seconds, and then he entered himself\a151 so large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was the very embodiment of self-possession and solidity. And yet his first action when the door had closed behind him was to stagger against the table, whence he slipped down upon the floor, and there was that majestic figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearthrug.We had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage, which told of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life. Then Holmes hurried with a cushion for his head and I with brandy for his lips. The heavy white face was seamed with lines of trouble, the hanging pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. Collar and shirt bore the grime of a long journey, and the hair bristled unkempt from the well-shaped head. It was a sorely-stricken man who lay before us.\a147What is it, Watson?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Absolute exhaustion\a151 possibly mere hunger and fatigue,\a148 said I, with my finger on the thready pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and small.\a147Return ticket from Mackleton, in the North of England,\a148 said Holmes, drawing it from the watch-pocket. \a147It is not twelve o\a146clock yet. He has certainly been an early starter.\a148The puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and now a pair of vacant, grey eyes looked up at us. An instant later the man had scrambled on to his feet, his face crimson with shame.\a147Forgive this weakness, Mr. Holmes; I have been a little overwrought. Thank you, if I might have a glass of milk and a biscuit I have no doubt that I should be better. I came personally, Mr. Holmes, in order to ensure that you would return with me. I feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case.\a148\a147When you are quite restored\a151\a151\a148\a147I am quite well again. I cannot imagine how I came to be so weak. I wish you, Mr. Holmes, to come to Mackleton with me by the next train.\a148My friend shook his head.\a147My colleague, Dr. Watson, could tell you that we are very busy at present. I am retained in this case of the Ferrers Documents, and the Abergavenny murder is coming up for trial. Only a very important issue could call me from London at present.\a148\a147Important!. Our visitor threw up his hands. \a147Have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the Duke of Holdernesse?\a148\a147What! the late Cabinet Minister?\a148\a147Exactly. We had tried to keep it out of the papers, but there was some rumour in the \iGlobe\i last night. I thought it might have reached your ears.\a148Holmes shot out his long, thin arm and picked out Volume \a147H\a148 in his encyclopaedia of reference.\a147\a160\a145Holdernesse, 6th Duke, K.G., P.C.\a146half the alphabet. \a145Baron Beverley, Earl of Carston\a146dear me, what a list. \a145Lord Lieutenant of Hallamshire since 1900. Married Edith, daughter of Sir Charles Appledore, 1888. Heir and only child, Lord Saltire. Owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres. Minerals in Lancashire and Wales. Address: Carlton House Terrace; Holdernesse Hall, Hallamshire; Carston Castle, Bangor, Wales. Lord of the Admiralty, 1872; Chief Secretary of State for\a151. Well, well, this man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the Crown!\a148\a147The greatest and perhaps the wealthiest. I am aware, Mr. Holmes, that you take a very high line in professional matters, and that you are prepared to work for the work\a146s sake. I may tell you, however, that his Grace has already intimated that a cheque for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and another thousand to him who can name the man, or men, who have taken him.\a148\a147It is a princely offer,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Watson, I think that we shall accompany Dr. Huxtable back to the North of England. And now, Dr. Huxtable, when you have consumed that milk you will kindly tell me what has happened, when it happened, how it happened, and, finally, what Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable, of the Priory School, near Mackleton, has to do with the matter, and why he comes three days after an event\a151 the state of your chin gives the date\a151 to ask for my humble services.\a148Our visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits. The light had come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks as he set himself with great vigour and lucidity to explain the situation.\a147I must inform you, gentlemen, that the Priory is a preparatory school, of which I am the founder and principal. \iHuxtable\a146s Sidelights on Horace\i may possibly recall my name to your memories. The Priory is, without exception, the best and most select preparatory school in England. Lord Leverstoke, the Earl of Blackwater, Sir Cathcart Soames\a151 they all have entrusted their sons to me. But I felt that my school had reached its zenith when, three weeks ago, the Duke of Holdernesse sent Mr. James Wilder, his secretary, with the intimation that young Lord Saltire, ten years old, his only son and heir, was about to be committed to my charge. Little did I think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my life.\a147On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer term. He was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may tell you\a151 I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-confidences are absurd in such a case\a151 that he was not entirely happy at home. It is an open secret that the Duke\a146s married life had not been a peaceful one, and the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent, the Duchess taking up her residence in the South of France. This had occurred very shortly before, and the boy\a146s sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother. He moped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall, and it was for this reason that the Duke desired to send him to my establishment. In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us, and was apparently absolutely happy.\a147He was last seen on the night of May 13ththat is, the night of last Monday. His room was on the second floor, and was approached through another larger room in which two boys were sleeping. These boys saw and heard nothing, so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass out that way. His window was open, and there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground. We could trace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this is the only possible exit.\a147His absence was discovered at seven o\a146clock on Tuesday morning. His bed had been slept in. He had dressed himself fully before going off in his usual school suit of black Eton jacket and dark grey trousers. There were no signs that anyone had entered the room, and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of cries, or a struggle, would have been heard, since Caunter, the elder boy in the inner room, is a very light sleeper.\a147When Lord Saltire\a146s disappearance was discovered I at once called a roll of the whole establishment, boys, masters, and servants. It was then that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not been alone in his flight. Heidegger, the German master, was missing. His room was on the second floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the same way as Lord Saltire\a146s. His bed had also been slept in; but he had apparently gone away partly dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. His bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was gone.\a147He had been with me for two years, and came with the best references; but he was a silent, morose man, not very popular either with masters or boys. No trace could be found of the fugitives, and now on Thursday morning we are as ignorant as we were on Tuesday. Inquiry was, of course, made at once at Holdernesse Hall. It is only a few miles away, and we imagined that in some sudden attack of home-sickness he had gone back to his father; but nothing had been heard of him. The Duke is greatly agitated\a151 and as to me, you have seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have reduced me. Mr. Holmes, if ever you put forward your full powers, I implore you to do so now, for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them.\a148Sherlock Holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the statement of the unhappy schoolmaster. His drawn brows and the deep furrow between them showed that he needed no exhortation to concentrate all his attention upon a problem which, apart from the tremendous interests involved, must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the unusual. He now drew out his note-book and jotted down one or two memoranda.\a147You have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner,\a148 said he, severely. \a147You start me on my investigation with a very serious handicap. It is inconceivable, for example, that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer.\a148\a147I am not to blame, Mr. Holmes. His Grace was extremely desirous to avoid all public scandal. He was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world. He has a deep horror of anything of the kind.\a148\a147But there has been some official investigation?\a148\a147Yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing. An apparent clue was at once obtained, since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train. Only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in Liverpool, and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand. Then it was that in my despair and disappointment, after a sleepless night, I came straight to you by the early train.\a148\a147I suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up?\a148\a147It was entirely dropped.\a148\a147So that three days have been wasted. The affair has been most deplorably handled.\a148\a147I feel it, and admit it.\a148\a147And yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution. I shall be very happy to look into it. Have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this German master?\a148\a147None at all.\a148\a147Was he in the master\a146s class?\a148\a147No; he never exchanged a word with him so far as I know.\a148\a147That is certainly very singular. Had the boy a bicycle?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Was any other bicycle missing?\a148 \a147No.\a148\a147Is that certain?\a148\a147Quite.\a148\a147Well, now, you do not mean to seriously suggest that this German rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night bearing the boy in his arms?\a148\a147Certainly not.\a148\a147Then what is the theory in your mind?\a148\a147The bicycle may have been a blind. It may have been hidden somewhere and the pair gone off on foot.\a148\a147Quite so; but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not? Were there other bicycles in this shed?\a148\a147Several.\a148\a147Would he not have hidden \ia couple\i had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them?\a148\a147I suppose he would.\a148\a147Of course he would. The blind theory won\a146t do. But the incident is an admirable starting-point for an investigation. After all, a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy. One other question. Did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Did he get any letters?\a148\a147Yes; one letter.\a148\a147From whom?\a148\a147From his father.\a148\a147Do you open the boys\a146 letters?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147How do you know it was from the father?\a148\a147The coat of arms was on the envelope, and it was addressed in the Duke\a146s peculiar stiff hand. Besides, the Duke remembers having written.\a148\a147When had he a letter before that?\a148\a147Not for several days.\a148\a147Had he ever one from France?\a148\a147No; never.\a147You see the point of my questions, of course. Either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will. In the latter case you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing. If he has had no visitors, that prompting must have come in letters. Hence I try to find out who were his correspondents.\a148\a147I fear I cannot help you much. His only correspondent, so far as I know, was his own father.\a148\a147Who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance. Were the relations between father and son very friendly?\a148\a147His Grace is never very friendly with anyone. He is completely immersed in large public questions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions. But he was always kind to the boy in his own way.\a148\a147But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Did he say so?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147The Duke, then?\a148\a147Good heavens, no!\a148\a147Then how could you know?\a148\a147I have had some confidential talks with Mr. James Wilder, his Grace\a146s secretary. It was he who gave me the information about Lord Saltire\a146s feelings.\a148\a147I see. By the way, that last letter of the Duke\a146s\a151 was it found in the boy\a146s room after he was gone?\a148\a147No; he had taken it with him. I think, Mr. Holmes, it is time that we were leaving for Euston.\a148\a147I will order a four-wheeler. In a quarter of an hour we shall be at your service. If you are telegraphing home, Mr. Huxtable, it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in Liverpool, or wherever else that red herring led your pack. In the meantime I will do a little quiet work at your own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like Watson and myself may get a sniff of it.\a148That evening found us in the cold, bracing atmosphere of the Peak country, in which Dr. Huxtable\a146s famous school is situated. It was already dark when we reached it. A card was lying on the hall table, and the butler whispered something to his master, who turned to us with agitation in every heavy feature.\a147The Duke is here,\a148 said he. \a147The Duke and Mr. Wilder are in the study. Come, gentlemen, and I will introduce you.\a148I was, of course, familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman, but the man himself was very different from his representation. He was a tall and stately person, scrupulously dressed, with a drawn, thin face, and a nose which was grotesquely curved and long. His complexion was of a dead pallor, which was more startling by contrast with a long, dwindling beard of vivid red, which flowed down over his white waistcoat, with his watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. Such was the stately presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of Dr. Huxtable\a146s hearthrug. Beside him stood a very young man, whom I understood to be Wilder, the private secretary. He was small, nervous, alert, with intelligent, light-blue eyes and mobile features. It was he who at once, in an incisive and positive tone, opened the conversation.\a147I called this morning, Dr. Huxtable, too late to prevent you from starting for London. I learned that your object was to invite Mr. Sherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct of this case. His Grace is surprised, Dr. Huxtable, that you should have taken such a step without consulting him.\a148\a147When I learned that the police had failed\a151\a151\a148\a147His Grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed.\a148\a147But surely, Mr. Wilder\a151\a151\a148\a147You are well aware, Dr. Huxtable, that his Grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal. He prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence.\a148\a147The matter can be easily remedied,\a148 said the brow-beaten doctor; \a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes can return to London by the morning train.\a148\a147Hardly that, Doctor, hardly that,\a148 said Holmes, in his blandest voice. \a147This northern air is invigorating and pleasant, so I propose to spend a few days upon your moors, and to occupy my mind as best I may. Whether I have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is, of course, for you to decide.\a148I could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of indecision, from which he was rescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the red-bearded Duke, which boomed out like a dinner-gong.\a147I agree with Mr. Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, that you would have done wisely to consult me. But since Mr. Holmes has already been taken into your confidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services. Far from going to the inn, Mr. Holmes, I should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse Hall.\a148\a147I thank your Grace. For the purposes of my investigation I think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery.\a148\a147Just as you like, Mr. Holmes. Any information which Mr. Wilder or I can give you is, of course, at your disposal.\a148\a147It will probably be necessary for me to see you at the Hall,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?\a148\a147No, sir, I have not.\a148\a147Excuse me if I allude to that which is painful to you, but I have no alternative. Do you think that the Duchess had anything to do with the matter?\a148The great Minister showed perceptible hesitation.\a147I do not think so,\a148 he said, at last.\a147The other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom. You have not had any demand of the sort?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147One more question, your Grace. I understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred.\a148\a147No; I wrote upon the day before.\a148\a147Exactly. But he received it on that day?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step?\a148\a147No, sir, certainly not.\a148\a147Did you post that letter yourself?\a148The nobleman\a146s reply was interrupted by his secretary, who broke in with some heat.\a147His Grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself,\a148 said he. \a147This letter was laid with others upon the study table, and I myself put them in the post-bag.\a148\a147You are sure this one was among them?\a148\a147Yes; I observed it.\a148\a147How many letters did your Grace write that day?\a148\a147Twenty or thirty. I have a large correspondence. But surely this is somewhat irrelevant?\a148\a147Not entirely,\a148 said Holmes.\a147For my own part,\a148 the Duke continued, \a147I have advised the police to turn their attention to the South of France. I have already said that I do not believe that the Duchess would encourage so monstrous an action, but the lad had the most wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that he may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this German. I think, Dr. Huxtable, that we will now return to the Hall.\a148I could see that there were other questions which Holmes would have wished to put; but the nobleman\a146s abrupt manner showed that the interview was at an end. It was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent, and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history.When the nobleman and his secretary had left, my friend flung himself at once with characteristic eagerness into the investigation.The boy\a146s chamber was carefully examined, and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could have escaped. The German master\a146s room and effects gave no further clue. In his case a trailer of ivy had given way under his weight, and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come down. That one dint in the short green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight.Sherlock Holmes left the house alone, and only returned after eleven. He had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he brought into my room, where he laid it out on the bed, and, having balanced the lamp in the middle of it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of his pipe.\a147This case grows upon me, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147There are decidedly some points of interest in connection with it. In this early stage I want you to realize those geographical features which may have a good deal to do with our investigation.\c\i\m="prio-i.png"\i\c\a147Look at this map. This dark square is the Priory School. I\a146ll put a pin in it. Now, this line is the main road. You see that it runs east and west past the school, and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either way. If these two folk passed away by road it was \ithis\i road.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147By a singular and happy chance we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question. At this point, where my pipe is now resting, a country constable was on duty from twelve to six. It is, as you perceive, the first cross road on the east side. This man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant, and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen. I have spoken with this policeman to-night, and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person. That blocks this end. We have now to deal with the other. There is an inn here, the Red Bull, the landlady of which was ill. She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor, but he did not arrive until morning, being absent at another case. The people at the inn were alert all night, awaiting his coming, and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road. They declare that no one passed. If their evidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west, and also to be able to say that the fugitives did \inot\i use the road at all.\a148\a147But the bicycle?\a148 I objected.\a147Quite so. We will come to the bicycle presently. To continue our reasoning: if these people did not go by the road, they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house. That is certain. Let us weigh the one against the other. On the south of the house is, as you perceive, a large district of arable land, cut up into small fields, with stone walls between them. There, I admit that a bicycle is impossible. We can dismiss the idea. We turn to the country on the north. Here there lies a grove of trees, marked as the \a145Ragged Shaw,\a146 and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor, Lower Gill Moor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upwards. Here, at one side of this wilderness, is Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by road, but only six across the moor. It is a peculiarly desolate plain. A few moor farmers have small holdings, where they rear sheep and cattle. Except these, the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the Chesterfield high road. There is a church there, you see, a few cottages, and an inn. Beyond that the hills become precipitous. Surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie.\a148\a147But the bicycle?\a148 I persisted.\a147Well, well!\a148 said Holmes, impatiently. \a147A good cyclist does not need a high road. The moor is intersected with paths and the moon was at the full. Halloa! what is this?\a148There was an agitated knock at the door, and an instant afterwards Dr. Huxtable was in the room. In his hand he held a blue cricket-cap, with a white chevron on the peak.\a147At last we have a clue!\a148 he cried. \a147Thank Heaven! at last we are on the dear boy\a146s track. It is his cap.\a148\a147Where was it found?\a148\a147In the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor. They left on Tuesday. To-day the police traced them down and examined their caravan. This was found.\a148\a147How do they account for it?\a148\a147They shuffled and lied\a151 said that they found it on the moor on Tuesday morning. They know where he is, the rascals. Thank goodness, they are all safe under lock and key. Either the fear of the law or the Duke\a146s purse will certainly get out of them all that they know.\a148\a147So far, so good,\a148 said Holmes, when the doctor had at last left the room. \a147It at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the Lower Gill Moor that we must hope for results. The police have really done nothing locally, save the arrest of these gipsies. Look here, Watson. There is a watercourse across the moor. You see it marked here in the map. In some parts it widens into a morass. This is particularly so in the region between Holdernesse Hall and the school. It is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather; but at \ithat\i point there is certainly a chance of some record being left. I will call you early to-morrow morning, and you and I will try if we can throw some little light upon the mystery.\a148The day was just breaking when I woke to find the long, thin form of Holmes by my bedside. He was fully dressed, and had apparently already been out.\a147I have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,\a148 said he. \a147I have also had a ramble through the Ragged Shaw. Now, Watson, there is cocoa ready in the next room. I must beg you to hurry, for we have a great day before us.\a148His eyes shone, and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration of the master workman who sees his work lie ready before him. A very different Holmes, this active, alert man, from the introspective and pallid dreamer of Baker Street. I felt, as I looked upon that supple figure, alive with nervous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day that awaited us.And yet it opened in the blackest disappointment. With high hopes we struck across the peaty, russet moor, intersected with a thousand sheep paths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt which marked the morass between us and Holdernesse. Certainly, if the lad had gone homewards, he must have passed this, and he could not pass it without leaving his traces. But no sign of him or the German could be seen. With a darkening face my friend strode along the margin, eagerly observant of every muddy stain upon the mossy surface. Sheep-marks there were in profusion, and at one place, some miles down, cows had left their tracks. Nothing more.\a147Check number one,\a148 said Holmes, looking gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor. \a147There is another morass down yonder and a narrow neck between. Halloa! halloa! halloa! what have we here?\a148We had come on a small black ribbon of pathway. In the middle of it, clearly marked on the sodden soil, was the track of a bicycle.\a147Hurrah!\a148 I cried. \a147We have it.\a148But Holmes was shaking his head, and his face was puzzled and expectant rather than joyous.\a147A bicycle, certainly, but not \ithe\i bicycle,\a148 said he. \a147I am familiar with forty-two different impressions left by tyres. This, as you perceive, is a Dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. Heidegger\a146s tyres were Palmer\a146s, leaving longitudinal stripes. Aveling, the mathematical master, was sure upon the point. Therefore, it is not Heidegger\a146s track.\a148\a147The boy\a146s, then?\a148\a147Possibly, if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession. But this we have utterly failed to do. This track, as you perceive, was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school.\a148\a147Or towards it?\a148\a147No, no, my dear Watson. The more deeply sunk impression is, of course, the hind wheel, upon which the weight rests. You perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one. It was undoubtedly heading away from the school. It may or may not be connected with our inquiry, but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther.\a148We did so, and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the boggy portion of the moor. Following the path backwards, we picked out another spot, where a spring trickled across it. Here, once again, was the mark of the bicycle, though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows. After that there was no sign, but the path ran right on into Ragged Shaw, the wood which backed on to the school. From this wood the cycle must have emerged. Holmes sat down on a boulder and rested his chin in his hands. I had smoked two cigarettes before he moved.\a147Well, well,\a148 said he, at last. \a147It is, of course, possible that a cunning man might change the tyre of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks. A criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom I should be proud to do business with. We will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass again, for we have left a good deal unexplored.\a148We continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion of the moor, and soon our perseverance was gloriously rewarded. Right across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path. Holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it. An impression like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it. It was the Palmer tyre.\a147Here is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!\a148 cried Holmes, exultantly. \a147My reasoning seems to have been pretty sound, Watson.\a148\a147I congratulate you.\a148\a147But we have a long way still to go. Kindly walk clear of the path. Now let us follow the trail. I fear that it will not lead very far.\a148We found, however, as we advanced that this portion of the moor is intersected with soft patches, and, though we frequently lost sight of the track, we always succeeded in picking it up once more.\a147Do you observe,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that the rider is now undoubtedly forcing the pace. There can be no doubt of it. Look at this impression, where you get both tyres clear. The one is as deep as the other. That can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handle-bar, as a man does when he is sprinting. By Jove! he has had a fall.\a148There was a broad, irregular smudge covering some yards of the track. Then there were a few footmarks, and the tyre reappeared once more.\a147A side-slip,\a148 I suggested.Holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse. To my horror I perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. On the path, too, and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood.\a147Bad!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Bad. Stand clear, Watson. Not an unnecessary footstep. What do I read here. He fell wounded, he stood up, he remounted, he proceeded. But there is no other track. Cattle on this side path. He was surely not gored by a bull. Impossible. But I see no traces of anyone else. We must push on, Watson. Surely with stains as well as the track to guide us he cannot escape us now.\a148Our search was not a very long one. The tracks of the tyre began to curve fantastically upon the wet and shining path. Suddenly, as I looked ahead, the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick gorse bushes. Out of them we dragged a bicycle, Palmer-tyred, one pedal bent, and the whole front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with blood. On the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting. We ran round, and there lay the unfortunate rider. He was a tall man, full bearded, with spectacles, one glass of which had been knocked out. The cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head, which had crushed in part of his skull. That he could have gone on after receiving such an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man. He wore shoes, but no socks, and his open coat disclosed a night-shirt beneath it. It was undoubtedly the German master.Holmes turned the body over reverently, and examined it with great attention. He then sat in deep thought for a time, and I could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not, in his opinion, advanced us much in our inquiry.\a147It is a little difficult to know what to do, Watson,\a148 said he, at last. \a147My own inclinations are to push this inquiry on, for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour. On the other hand, we are bound to inform the police of the discovery, and to see that this poor fellow\a146s body is looked after.\a148\a147I could take a note back.\a148\a147But I need your company and assistance. Wait a bit. There is a fellow cutting peat up yonder. Bring him over here, and he will guide the police.\a148I brought the peasant across, and Holmes dispatched the frightened man with a note to Dr. Huxtable.\a147Now, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147we have picked up two clues this morning. One is the bicycle with the Palmer tyre, and we see what that has led to. The other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop. Before we start to investigate that, let us try to realize what we \ido\i know so as to make the most of it, and to separate the essential from the accidental.\a148\a147First of all I wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free will. He got down from his window and he went off, either alone or with someone. That is sure.\a148I assented.\a147Well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate German master. The boy was fully dressed when he fled. Therefore, he foresaw what he would do. But the German went without his socks. He certainly acted on very short notice.\a148\a147Undoubtedly.\a148\a147Why did he go. Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the flight of the boy. Because he wished to overtake him and bring him back. He seized his bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursuing him met his death.\a148\a147So it would seem.\a148\a147Now I come to the critical part of my argument. The natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him. He would know that he could overtake him. But the German does not do so. He turns to his bicycle. I am told that he was an excellent cyclist. He would not do this if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape.\a148\a147The other bicycle.\a148\a147Let us continue our reconstruction. He meets his death five miles from the school\a151 not by a bullet, mark you, which even a lad might conceivably discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm. The lad, then, \ihad\i a companion in his flight. And the flight was a swift one, since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them. Yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy. What do we find. A few cattle tracks, nothing more. I took a wide sweep round, and there is no path within fifty yards. Another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder. Nor were there any human footmarks.\a148\a147Holmes,\a148 I cried, \a147this is impossible.\a148\a147Admirable!\a148 he said. \a147A most illuminating remark. It \iis\i impossible as I state it, and therefore I must in some respect have stated it wrong. Yet you saw for yourself. Can you suggest any fallacy?\a148\a147He could not have fractured his skull in a fall?\a148\a147In a morass, Watson?\a148\a147I am at my wit\a146s end.\a148\a147Tut, tut; we have solved some worse problems. At least we have plenty of material, if we can only use it. Come, then, and, having exhausted the Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us.\a148We picked up the track and followed it onwards for some distance; but soon the moor rose into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the watercourse behind us. No further help from tracks could be hoped for. At the spot where we saw the last of the Dunlop tyre it might equally have led to Holdernesse Hall, the stately towers of which rose some miles to our left, or to a low, grey village which lay in front of us, and marked the position of the Chesterfield high road.As we approached the forbidding and squalid inn, with the sign of a game-cock above the door, Holmes gave a sudden groan and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling. He had had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. With difficulty he limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe.\a147How are you, Mr. Reuben Hayes?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?\a148 the countryman answered, with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes.\a147Well, it\a146s printed on the board above your head. It\a146s easy to see a man who is master of his own house. I suppose you haven\a146t such a thing as a carriage in your stables?\a148\a147No; I have not.\a148\a147I can hardly put my foot to the ground.\a148\a147Don\a146t put it to the ground.\a148\a147But I can\a146t walk.\a148\a147Well, then, hop.\a148Mr. Reuben Hayes\a146s manner was far from gracious, but Holmes took it with admirable good-humour.\a147Look here, my man,\a148 said he. \a147This is really rather an awkward fix for me. I don\a146t mind how I get on.\a148\a147Neither do I,\a148 said the morose landlord.\a147The matter is very important. I would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle.\a148The landlord pricked up his ears.\a147Where do you want to go?\a148\a147To Holdernesse Hall.\a148\a147Pals of the Dook, I suppose?\a148 said the landlord, surveying our mud-stained garments with ironical eyes.Holmes laughed good-naturedly.\a147He\a146ll be glad to see us, anyhow.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Because we bring him news of his lost son.\a148The landlord gave a very visible start.\a147What, you\a146re on his track?\a148\a147He has been heard of in Liverpool. They expect to get him every hour.\a148Again a swift change passed over the heavy, unshaven face. His manner was suddenly genial.\a147I\a146ve less reason to wish the Dook well than most men,\a148 said he, \a147for I was his head coachman once, and cruel bad he treated me. It was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn-chandler. But I\a146m glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in Liverpool, and I\a146ll help you to take the news to the Hall.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We\a146ll have some food first. Then you can bring round the bicycle.\a148\a147I haven\a146t got a bicycle.\a148Holmes held up a sovereign.\a147I tell you, man, that I haven\a146t got one. I\a146ll let you have two horses as far as the Hall.\a148\a147Well, well,\a148 said Holmes, \a147we\a146ll talk about it when we\a146ve had something to eat.\a148When we were left alone in the stone-flagged kitchen it was astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered. It was nearly nightfall, and we had eaten nothing since early morning, so that we spent some time over our meal. Holmes was lost in thought, and once or twice he walked over to the window and stared earnestly out. It opened on to a squalid courtyard. In the far corner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at work. On the other side were the stables. Holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation.\a147By Heaven, Watson, I believe that I\a146ve got it!\a148 he cried. \a147Yes, yes, it must be so. Watson, do you remember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?\a148\a147Yes, several.\a148\a147Where?\a148\a147Well, everywhere. They were at the morass, and again on the path, and again near where poor Heidegger met his death.\a148\a147Exactly. Well, now, Watson, how many cows did you see on the moor?\a148\a147I don\a146t remember seeing any.\a148\a147Strange, Watson, that we should see tracks all along our line, but never a cow on the whole moor; very strange, Watson, eh?\a148\a147Yes, it is strange.\a148\a147Now, Watson, make an effort; throw your mind back. Can you see those tracks upon the path?\a148\a147Yes, I can.\a148\a147Can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that, Watson\a148he arranged a number of bread-crumbs in this fashion: : : : :\a147and sometimes like this\a148: . : . : . : .\a147and occasionally like this\a148 ' . ' . ' . ' . \a147Can you remember that?\a148\a147No, I cannot.\a148\a147But I can. I could swear to it. However, we will go back at our leisure and verify it. What a blind beetle I have been not to draw my conclusion!\a148\a147And what is your conclusion?\a148\a147Only that it is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and gallops. By George, Watson, it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that. The coast seems to be clear, save for that lad in the smithy. Let us slip out and see what we can see.\a148There were two rough-haired, unkempt horses in the tumble-down stable. Holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed aloud.\a147Old shoes, but newly shod\a151 old shoes, but new nails. This case deserves to be a classic. Let us go across to the smithy.\a148The lad continued his work without regarding us. I saw Holmes\a146s eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood which was scattered about the floor. Suddenly, however, we heard a step behind us, and there was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes, his swarthy features convulsed with passion. He held a short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket.\a147You infernal spies!\a148 the man cried. \a147What are you doing there?\a148\a147Why, Mr. Reuben Hayes,\a148 said Holmes, coolly, \a147one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out.\a148The man mastered himself with a violent effort, and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh, which was more menacing than his frown.\a147You\a146re welcome to all you can find out in my smithy,\a148 said he. \a147But look here, mister, I don\a146t care for folk poking about my place without my leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better I shall be pleased.\a148\a147All right, Mr. Hayes\a151 no harm meant,\a148 said Holmes. \a147We have been having a look at your horses, but I think I\a146ll walk after all. It\a146s not far, I believe.\a148\a147Not more than two miles to the Hall gates. That\a146s the road to the left. He watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises.We did not go very far along the road, for Holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us from the landlord\a146s view.\a147We were warm, as the children say, at that inn,\a148 said he. \a147I seem to grow colder every step that I take away from it. No, no; I can\a146t possibly leave it.\a148\a147I am convinced,\a148 said I, \a147that this Reuben Hayes knows all about it. A more self-evident villain I never saw.\a148\a147Oh! he impressed you in that way, did he. There are the horses, there is the smithy. Yes, it is an interesting place, this Fighting Cock. I think we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way.\a148A long, sloping hillside, dotted with grey limestone boulders, stretched behind us. We had turned off the road, and were making our way up the hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall, I saw a cyclist coming swiftly along.\a147Get down, Watson!\a148 cried Holmes, with a heavy hand upon my shoulder. We had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road. Amid a rolling cloud of dust I caught a glimpse of a pale, agitated face\a151 a face with horror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes staring wildly in front. It was like some strange caricature of the dapper James Wilder whom we had seen the night before.\a147The Duke\a146s secretary!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147Come, Watson, let us see what he does.\a148We scrambled from rock to rock until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn. Wilder\a146s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. No one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then in the gloom we saw the two side-lamps of a trap light up in the stable yard of the inn, and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of Chesterfield.\a147What do you make of that, Watson?\a148 Holmes whispered.\a147It looks like a flight.\a148\a147A single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could see. Well, it certainly was not Mr. James Wilder, for there he is at the door.\a148A red square of light had sprung out of the darkness. In the middle of it was the black figure of the secretary, his head advanced, peering out into the night. It was evident that he was expecting someone. Then at last there were steps in the road, a second figure was visible for an instant against the light, the door shut, and all was black once more. Five minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor.\a147It seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the Fighting Cock,\a148 said Holmes.\a147The bar is on the other side.\a148\a147Quite so. These are what one may call the private guests. Now, what in the world is Mr. James Wilder doing in that den at this hour of night, and who is the companion who comes to meet him there. Come, Watson, we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely.\a148Together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the inn. The bicycle still leaned against the wall. Holmes struck a match and held it to the back wheel, and I heard him chuckle as the light fell upon a patched Dunlop tyre. Up above us was the lighted window.\a147I must have a peep through that, Watson. If you bend your back and support yourself upon the wall, I think that I can manage.\a148An instant later his feet were on my shoulders. But he was hardly up before he was down again.\a147Come, my friend,\a148 said he, \a147our day\a146s work has been quite long enough. I think that we have gathered all that we can. It\a146s a long walk to the school, and the sooner we get started the better.\a148He hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the moor, nor would he enter the school when he reached it, but went on to Mackleton Station, whence he could send some telegrams. Late at night I heard him consoling Dr. Huxtable, prostrated by the tragedy of his master\a146s death, and later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the morning. \a147All goes well, my friend,\a148 said he. \a147I promise that before to-morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery.\a148At eleven o\a146clock next morning my friend and I were walking up the famous yew avenue of Holdernesse Hall. We were ushered through the magnificent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace\a146s study. There we found Mr. James Wilder, demure and courtly, but with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features.\a147You have come to see his Grace. I am sorry; but the fact is that the Duke is far from well. He has been very much upset by the tragic news. We received a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday afternoon, which told us of your discovery.\a148\a147I must see the Duke, Mr. Wilder.\a148\a147But he is in his room.\a148\a147Then I must go to his room.\a148\a147I believe he is in his bed.\a148\a147I will see him there.\a148Holmes\a146s cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was useless to argue with him.\a147Very good, Mr. Holmes; I will tell him that you are here.\a148After half an hour\a146s delay the great nobleman appeared. His face was more cadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before. He greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk, his red beard streaming down on to the table.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes?\a148 said he.But my friend\a146s eyes were fixed upon the secretary, who stood by his master\a146s chair.\a147I think, your Grace, that I could speak more freely in Mr. Wilder\a146s absence.\a148The man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at Holmes.\a147If your Grace wishes\a151\a151\a148\a147Yes, yes; you had better go. Now, Mr. Holmes, what have you to say?\a148My friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating secretary.\a147The fact is, your Grace,\a148 said he, \a147that my colleague, Dr. Watson, and myself had an assurance from Dr. Huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case. I should like to have this confirmed from your own lips.\a148\a147Certainly, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147It amounted, if I am correctly informed, to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147And another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147Under the latter heading is included, no doubt, not only those who may have taken him away, but also those who conspire to keep him in his present position?\a148\a147Yes, yes,\a148 cried the Duke, impatiently. \a147If you do your work well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you will have no reason to complain of niggardly treatment.\a148My friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of avidity which was a surprise to me, who knew his frugal tastes.\a147I fancy that I see your Grace\a146s cheque-book upon the table,\a148 said he. \a147I should be glad if you would make me out a cheque for six thousand pounds. It would be as well, perhaps, for you to cross it. The Capital and Counties Bank, Oxford Street branch, are my agents.\a148His Grace sat very stern and upright in his chair, and looked stonily at my friend.\a147Is this a joke, Mr. Holmes. It is hardly a subject for pleasantry.\a148\a147Not at all, your Grace. I was never more earnest in my life.\a148\a147What do you mean, then?\a148\a147I mean that I have earned the reward. I know where your son is, and I know some, at least, of those who are holding him.\a148The Duke\a146s beard had turned more aggressively red than ever against his ghastly white face.\a147Where is he?\a148 he gasped.\a147He is, or was last night, at the Fighting Cock Inn, about two miles from your park gate.\a148The Duke fell back in his chair.\a147And whom do you accuse?\a148Sherlock Holmes\a146s answer was an astounding one. He stepped swiftly forward and touched the Duke upon the shoulder.\a147I accuse \iyou\i,\a148 said he. \a147And now, your Grace, I\a146ll trouble you for that cheque.\a148Never shall I forget the Duke\a146s appearance as he sprang up and clawed with his hands like one who is sinking into an abyss. Then, with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he sat down and sank his face in his hands. It was some minutes before he spoke.\a147How much do you know?\a148 he asked at last, without raising his head.\a147I saw you together last night.\a148\a147Does anyone else besides your friend know?\a148\a147I have spoken to no one.\a148The Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his cheque-book.\a147I shall be as good as my word, Mr. Holmes. I am about to write your cheque, however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me. When the offer was first made I little thought the turn which events might take. But you and your friend are men of discretion, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I hardly understand your Grace.\a148\a147I must put it plainly, Mr. Holmes. If only you two know of this incident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. I think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that I owe you, is it not?\a148But Holmes smiled and shook his head.\a147I fear, your Grace, that matters can hardly be arranged so easily. There is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for.\a148\a147But James knew nothing of that. You cannot hold him responsible for that. It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ.\a148\a147I must take the view, your Grace, that when a man embarks upon a crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it.\a148\a147Morally, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. But surely not in the eyes of the law. A man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present, and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do. The instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me, so filled was he with horror and remorse. He lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer. Oh, Mr. Holmes, you must save him\a151 you must save him. I tell you that you must save him!. The Duke had dropped the last attempt at self-command, and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands raving in the air. At last he mastered himself and sat down once more at his desk. \a147I appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else,\a148 said he. \a147At least, we may take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal.\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think, your Grace, that this can only be done by absolute and complete frankness between us. I am disposed to help your Grace to the best of my ability; but in order to do so I must understand to the last detail how the matter stands. I realize that your words applied to Mr. James Wilder, and that he is not the murderer.\a148\a147No; the murderer has escaped.\a148Sherlock Holmes smiled demurely.\a147Your Grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which I possess, or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me. Mr. Reuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield on my information at eleven o\a146clock last night. I had a telegram from the head of the local police before I left the school this morning.\a148The Duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my friend.\a147You seem to have powers that are hardly human,\a148 said he. \a147So Reuben Hayes is taken. I am right glad to hear it, if it will not react upon the fate of James.\a148\a147Your secretary?\a148\a147No, sir; my son.\a148It was Holmes\a146s turn to look astonished.\a147I confess that this is entirely new to me, your Grace. I must beg you to be more explicit.\a148\a147I will conceal nothing from you. I agree with you that complete frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this desperate situation to which James\a146s folly and jealousy have reduced us. When I was a very young man, Mr. Holmes, I loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime. I offered the lady marriage, but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career. Had she lived I would certainly never have married anyone else. She died, and left this one child, whom for her sake I have cherished and cared for. I could not acknowledge the paternity to the world; but I gave him the best of educations, and since he came to manhood I have kept him near my person. He surprised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the claim which he has upon me and upon his power of provoking a scandal, which would be abhorrent to me. His presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above all, he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. You may well ask me why, under these circumstances, I still kept James under my roof. I answer that it was because I could see his mother\a146s face in his, and that for her dear sake there was no end to my long-suffering. All her pretty ways, too\a151 there was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory. I \icould\i not send him away. But I feared so much lest he should do Arthur\a151 that is, Lord Saltire\a151 a mischief that I dispatched him for safety to Dr. Huxtable\a146s school.\a147James came into contact with this fellow Hayes because the man was a tenant of mine, and James acted as agent. The fellow was a rascal from the beginning; but in some extraordinary way James became intimate with him. He had always a taste for low company. When James determined to kidnap Lord Saltire it was of this man\a146s service that he availed himself. You remember that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. Well, James opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the Ragged Shaw, which is near to the school. He used the Duchess\a146s name, and in that way got the boy to come. That evening James bicycled over\a151 I am telling you what he has himself confessed to me\a151 and he told Arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his mother longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse, who would take him to her. Poor Arthur fell into the trap. He came to the appointment and found this fellow Hayes with a led pony. Arthur mounted, and they set off together. It appears\a151 though this James only heard yesterday\a151 that they were pursued, that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick, and that the man died of his injuries. Hayes brought Arthur to his public-house, the Fighting Cock, where he was confined in an upper room, under the care of Mrs. Hayes, who is a kindly woman, but entirely under the control of her brutal husband.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, that was the state of affairs when I first saw you two days ago. I had no more idea of the truth than you. You will ask me what was James\a146s motive in doing such a deed. I answer that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir. In his view he should himself have been heir of all my estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible. At the same time he had a definite motive also. He was eager that I should break the entail, and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so. He intended to make a bargain with me\a151 to restore Arthur if I would break the entail, and so make it possible for the estate to be left to him by will. He knew well that I should never willingly invoke the aid of the police against him. I say that he would have proposed such a bargain to me, but he did not actually do so, for events moved too quickly for him, and he had not time to put his plans into practice.\a147What brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man Heidegger\a146s dead body. James was seized with horror at the news. It came to us yesterday as we sat together in this study. Dr. Huxtable had sent a telegram. James was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions, which had never been entirely absent, rose instantly to a certainty, and I taxed him with the deed. He made a complete voluntary confession. Then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer, so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life. I yielded\a151 as I have always yielded\a151 to his prayers, and instantly James hurried off to the Fighting Cock to warn Hayes and give him the means of flight. I could not go there by daylight without provoking comment, but as soon as night fell I hurried off to see my dear Arthur. I found him safe and well, but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed. In deference to my promise, and much against my will, I consented to leave him there for three days under the charge of Mrs. Hayes, since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer, and I could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate James. You asked for frankness, Mr. Holmes, and I have taken you at your word, for I have now told you everything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment. Do you in turn be as frank with me.\a148\a147I will,\a148 said Holmes. \a147In the first place, your Grace, I am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law. You have condoned a felony and you have aided the escape of a murderer; for I cannot doubt that any money which was taken by James Wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your Grace\a146s purse.\a148The Duke bowed his assent.\a147This is indeed a most serious matter. Even more culpable in my opinion, your Grace, is your attitude towards your younger son. You leave him in this den for three days.\a148\a147Under solemn promises\a151\a151\a148\a147What are promises to such people as these. You have no guarantee that he will not be spirited away again. To humour your guilty elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary danger. It was a most unjustifiable action.\a148The proud lord of Holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated in his own ducal hall. The blood flushed into his high forehead, but his conscience held him dumb.\a147I will help you, but on one condition only. It is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as I like.\a148Without a word the Duke pressed the electric bell. A servant entered.\a147You will be glad to hear,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that your young master is found. It is the Duke\a146s desire that the carriage shall go at once to the Fighting Cock Inn to bring Lord Saltire home.\a147Now,\a148 said Holmes, when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared, \a147having secured the future, we can afford to be more lenient with the past. I am not in an official position, and there is no reason, so long as the ends of justice are served, why I should disclose all that I know. As to Hayes I say nothing. The gallows awaits him, and I would do nothing to save him from it. What he will divulge I cannot tell, but I have no doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent. From the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom. If they do not themselves find it out I see no reason why I should prompt them to take a broader point of view. I would warn your Grace, however, that the continued presence of Mr. James Wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune.\a148\a147I understand that, Mr. Holmes, and it is already settled that he shall leave me for ever and go to seek his fortune in Australia.\a148\a147In that case, your Grace, since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence, I would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the Duchess, and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted.\a148\a147That also I have arranged, Mr. Holmes. I wrote to the Duchess this morning.\a148\a147In that case,\a148 said Holmes, rising, \a147I think that my friend and I can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the North. There is one other small point upon which I desire some light. This fellow Hayes had shod his horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows. Was it from Mr. Wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device?\a148The Duke stood in thought for a moment, with a look of intense surprise on his face. Then he opened a door and showed us into a large room furnished as a museum. He led the way to a glass case in a corner, and pointed to the inscription.\a147These shoes,\a148 it ran, \a147were dug up in the moat of Holdernesse Hall. They are for the use of horses; but they are shaped below with a cloven foot of iron, so as to throw pursuers off the track. They are supposed to have belonged to some of the marauding Barons of Holdernesse in the Middle Ages.\a148Holmes opened the case, and moistening his finger he passed it along the shoe. A thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin.\a147Thank you,\a148 said he, as he replaced the glass. \a147It is the second most interesting object that I have seen in the North.\a148\a147And the first?\a148Holmes folded up his cheque and placed it carefully in his note-book. \a147I am a poor man,\a148 said he, as he patted it affectionately and thrust it into the depths of his inner pocket.\p\X1\BBlack Peter\B\X1\c\i\m="blac-03.png"\i\cI have never known my friend to be in better form, both mental and physical, than in the year \a14695. His increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in Baker Street. Holmes, however, like all great artists, lived for his art\a146s sake, and, save in the case of the Duke of Holdernesse, I have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable services. So unworldly was he\a151 or so capricious\a151 that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity.In this memorable year \a14695 a curious and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention, ranging from his famous investigation of the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca\a151 an inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of His Holiness the Pope\a151 down to his arrest of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the East-End of London. Close on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of Woodman\a146s Lee, and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of Captain Peter Carey. No record of the doings of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete which did not include some account of this very unusual affair.During the first week of July my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that I knew he had something on hand. The fact that several rough-looking men called during that time and inquired for Captain Basil made me understand that Holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity. He had at least five small refuges in different parts of London in which he was able to change his personality. He said nothing of his business to me, and it was not my habit to force a confidence. The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. He had gone out before breakfast, and I had sat down to mine, when he strode into the room, his hat upon his head and a huge barbed-headed spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm.\a147Good gracious, Holmes!\a148 I cried. \a147You don\a146t mean to say that you have been walking about London with that thing?\a148\a147I drove to the butcher\a146s and back.\a148\a147The butcher\a146s?\a148\a147And I return with an excellent appetite. There can be no question, my dear Watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast. But I am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken.\a148\a147I will not attempt it.\a148He chuckled as he poured out the coffee.\a147If you could have looked into Allardyce\a146s back shop you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon. I was that energetic person, and I have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can I transfix the pig with a single blow. Perhaps you would care to try?\a148\a147Not for worlds. But why were you doing this?\a148\a147Because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of Woodman\a146s Lee. Ah, Hopkins, I got your wire last night, and I have been expecting you. Come and join us.\a148Our visitor was an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed in a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform. I recognised him at once as Stanley Hopkins, a young police inspector for whose future Holmes had high hopes, while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur. Hopkins\a146s brow was clouded, and he sat down with an air of deep dejection.\a147No, thank you, sir. I breakfasted before I came round. I spent the night in town, for I came up yesterday to report.\a148\a147And what had you to report?\a148\a147Failure, sir; absolute failure.\a148\a147You have made no progress?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Dear me. I must have a look at the matter.\a148\a147I wish to heavens that you would, Mr. Holmes. It\a146s my first big chance, and I am at my wit\a146s end. For goodness\a146 sake come down and lend me a hand.\a148\a147Well, well, it just happens that I have already read all the available evidence, including the report of the inquest, with some care. By the way, what do you make of that tobacco-pouch found on the scene of the crime. Is there no clue there?\a148Hopkins looked surprised.\a147It was the man\a146s own pouch, sir. His initials were inside it. And it was of seal-skin\a151 and he an old sealer.\a148\a147But he had no pipe.\a148\a147No, sir, we could find no pipe; indeed, he smoked very little. And yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends.\a148\a147No doubt. I only mention it because if I had been handling the case I should have been inclined to make that the starting-point of my investigation. However, my friend Dr. Watson knows nothing of this matter, and I should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more. Just give us some short sketch of the essentials.\a148Stanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket.\a147I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man, Captain Peter Carey. He was born in \a14645\a151 fifty years of age. He was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher. In 1883 he commanded the steam sealer \iSea Unicorn\i, of Dundee. He had then had several successful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he retired. After that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought a small place called Woodman\a146s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There he has lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day.\a147There were some most singular points about the man. In ordinary life he was a strict Puritan\a151 a silent, gloomy fellow. His household consisted of his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two female servants. These last were continually changing, for it was never a very cheery situation, and sometimes it became past all bearing. The man was an intermittent drunkard, and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend. He has been known to drive his wife and his daughter out of doors in the middle of the night, and flog them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams.\a147He was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar, who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct. In short, Mr. Holmes, you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than Peter Carey, and I have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship. He was known in the trade as Black Peter, and the name was given him, not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard, but for the humours which were the terror of all around him. I need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours, and that I have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end.\a147You must have read in the account of the inquest about the man\a146s cabin, Mr. Holmes; but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it. He had built himself a wooden outhouse\a151 he always called it \a145the cabin\a146a few hundred yards from his housea few hundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night. It was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. He kept the key in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold. There are small windows on each side, which were covered by curtains and never opened. One of these windows was turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what Black Peter was doing in there. That\a146s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest.\a147You remember that a stonemason, named Slater, walking from Forest Row about one o\a146clock in the morning\a151 two days before the murder\a151 stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees. He swears that the shadow of a man\a146s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was certainly not that of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that of a bearded man, but the beard was short and bristled forwards in a way very different from that of the captain. So he says, but he had been two hours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the window. Besides, this refers to the Monday, and the crime was done upon the Wednesday.\a147On the Tuesday Peter Carey was in one of his blackest moods, flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast. He roamed about the house, and the women ran for it when they heard him coming. Late in the evening he went down to his own hut. About two o\a146clock the following morning his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most fearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken. On rising at seven one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open, but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him. Peeping into the open door they saw a sight which sent them flying with white faces into the village. Within an hour I was on the spot and had taken over the case.\a147Well, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know, Mr. Holmes, but I give you my word that I got a shake when I put my head into that little house. It was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles, and the floor and walls were like a slaughter-house. He had called it a cabin, and a cabin it was sure enough, for you would have thought that you were in a ship. There was a bunk at one end, a sea-chest, maps and charts, a picture of the \iSea Unicorn\i, a line of log-books on a shelf, all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain\a146s room. And there in the middle of it was the man himself, his face twisted like a lost soul in torment, and his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his agony. Right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven, and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him. He was pinned like a beetle on a card. Of course, he was quite dead, and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony.\a147I know your methods, sir, and I applied them. Before I permitted anything to be moved I examined most carefully the ground outside, and also the floor of the room. There were no footmarks.\a148\a147Meaning that you saw none?\a148\a147I assure you, sir, that there were none.\a148\a147My good Hopkins, I have investigated many crimes, but I have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher. It is incredible that this blood-bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us. I understand, however, from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook?\a148The young inspector winced at my companion\a146s ironical comments.\a147I was a fool not to call you in at the time, Mr. Holmes. However, that\a146s past praying for now. Yes, there were several objects in the room which called for special attention. One was the harpoon with which the deed was committed. It had been snatched down from a rack on the wall. Two others remained there, and there was a vacant place for the third. On the stock was engraved \iSS. Sea Unicorn\i, Dundee\a148. This seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. The fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet Peter Carey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer, which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 said Holmes; \a147I think that both inferences are permissible. Was there any other spirit but rum in the room?\a148\a147Yes; there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea-chest. It is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters were full, and it had therefore not been used.\a148\a147For all that its presence has some significance,\a148 said Holmes. \a147However, let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case.\a148\a147There was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.\a148\a147What part of the table?\a148\a147It lay in the middle. It was of coarse seal-skin\a151 the straight-haired skin, with a leather thong to bind it. Inside was \a145P.C.\a146 on the flap. There was half an ounce of strong ship\a146s tobacco in it.\a148\a147Excellent. What more?\a148Stanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-covered note-book. The outside was rough and worn, the leaves discoloured. On the first page were written the initials \a147J.H.N.\a148 and the date \a1471883.. Holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way, while Hopkins and I gazed over each shoulder. On the second page were the printed letters \a147C.P.R.,\a148 and then came several sheets of numbers. Another heading was Argentine, another Costa Rica, and another San Paulo, each with pages of signs and figures after it.\a147What do you make of these?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange securities. I thought that \a145J.H.N.\a146 were the initials of a broker, and that \a145C.P.R.\a146 may have been his client.\a148\a147Try Canadian Pacific Railway,\a148 said Holmes.Stanley Hopkins swore between his teeth and struck his thigh with his clenched hand.\a147What a fool I have been!\a148 he cried. \a147Of course, it is as you say. Then \a145J.H.N.\a146 are the only initials we have to solve. I have already examined the old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one in 1883 either in the House or among the outside brokers whose initials correspond with these. Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold. You will admit, Mr. Holmes, that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present\a151 in other words, of the murderer. I would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime.\a148Sherlock Holmes\a146s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development.\a147I must admit both your points,\a148 said he. \a147I confess that this note-book, which did not appear at the inquest, modifies any views which I may have formed. I had come to a theory of the crime in which I can find no place for this. Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned?\a148\a147Inquiries are now being made at the offices, but I fear that the complete register of the stockholders of these South American concerns is in South America, and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares.\a148Holmes had been examining the cover of the note-book with his magnifying lens.\a147Surely there is some discolouration here,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. I told you that I picked the book off the floor.\a148\a147Was the blood-stain above or below?\a148\a147On the side next the boards.\a148\a147Which proves, of course, that the book was dropped after the crime was committed.\a148\a147Exactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated that point, and I conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight. It lay near the door.\a148\a147I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Have you any reason to suspect robbery?\a148\a147No, sir. Nothing seemed to have been touched.\a148\a147Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case. Then there was a knife, was there not?\a148\a147A sheath-knife, still in its sheath. It lay at the feet of the dead man. Mrs. Carey has identified it as being her husband\a146s property.\a148Holmes was lost in thought for some time.\a147Well,\a148 said he, at last, \a147I suppose I shall have to come out and have a look at it.\a148Stanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.\a147Thank you, sir. That will indeed be a weight off my mind.\a148Holmes shook his finger at the inspector.\a147It would have been an easier task a week ago,\a148 said he. \a147But even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless. Watson, if you can spare the time I should be very glad of your company. If you will call a four-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to start for Forest Row in a quarter of an hour.\a148Alighting at the small wayside station, we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods, which were once part of that great forest which for so long held the Saxon invaders at bay\a151 the impenetrable \a147weald,\a148 for sixty years the bulwark of Britain. Vast sections of it have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first iron-works of the country, and the trees have been felled to smelt the ore. Now the richer fields of the North have absorbed the trade, and nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the work of the past. Here in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill stood a long, low stone house, approached by a curving drive running through the fields. Nearer the road, and surrounded on three sides by bushes, was a small outhouse, one window and the door facing in our direction. It was the scene of the murder!Stanley Hopkins led us first to the house, where he introduced us to a haggard, grey-haired woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose gaunt and deep-lined face, with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her red-rimmed eyes, told of the years of hardship and ill-usage which she had endured. With her was her daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl, whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead, and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down. It was a terrible household that Black Peter Carey had made for himself, and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man.The outhouse was the simplest of dwellings, wooden-walled, shingle-roofed, one window beside the door and one on the farther side. Stanley Hopkins drew the key from his pocket, and had stooped to the lock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face.\a147Someone has been tampering with it,\a148 he said.There could be no doubt of the fact. The woodwork was cut and the scratches showed white through the paint, as if they had been that instant done. Holmes had been examining the window.\a147Someone has tried to force this also. Whoever it was has failed to make his way in. He must have been a very poor burglar.\a148\a147This is a most extraordinary thing,\a148 said the inspector; \a147I could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening.\a148\a147Some curious person from the village, perhaps,\a148 I suggested.\a147Very unlikely. Few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds, far less try to force their way into the cabin. What do you think of it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I think that fortune is very kind to us.\a148\a147You mean that the person will come again?\a148\a147It is very probable. He came expecting to find the door open. He tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife. He could not manage it. What would he do?\a148\a147Come again next night with a more useful tool.\a148\a147So I should say. It will be our fault if we are not there to receive him. Meanwhile, let me see the inside of the cabin.\a148The traces of the tragedy had been removed, but the furniture within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime. For two hours, with most intense concentration, Holmes examined every object in turn, but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one. Once only he paused in his patient investigation.\a147Have you taken anything off this shelf, Hopkins?\a148\a147No; I have moved nothing.\a148\a147Something has been taken. There is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere. It may have been a book lying on its side. It may have been a box. Well, well, I can do nothing more. Let us walk in these beautiful woods, Watson, and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers. We shall meet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night.\a148It was past eleven o\a146clock when we formed our little ambuscade. Hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger. The lock was a perfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it back. Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut, but outside it among the bushes which grew round the farther window. In this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit.It was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet brought with it something of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water pool and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey. What savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness. Was it a fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal, dangerous only to the weak and unguarded?In absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever might come. At first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound of voices from the village, lightened our vigil; but one by one these interruptions died away and an absolute stillness fell upon us, save for the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of the night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us in.Half-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes the dawn, when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate. Someone had entered the drive. Again there was a long silence, and I had begun to fear that it was a false alarm, when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a moment later a metallic scraping and clinking. The man was trying to force the lock. This time his skill was greater or his tool was better, for there was a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. Then a match was struck, and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut. Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the scene within.The nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail and thin, with a black moustache which intensified the deadly pallor of his face. He could not have been much above twenty years of age. I have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright, for his teeth were visibly chattering and he was shaking in every limb. He was dressed like a gentleman, in Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, with a cloth cap upon his head. We watched him staring round with frightened eyes. Then he laid the candle-end upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners. He returned with a large book, one of the log-books which formed a line upon the shelves. Leaning on the table he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought. Then, with an angry gesture of his clenched hand, he closed the book, replaced it in the corner, and put out the light. He had hardly turned to leave the hut when Hopkins\a146s hand was on the fellow\a146s collar, and I heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken. The candle was re-lit, and there was our wretched captive shivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective. He sank down upon the sea-chest, and looked helplessly from one of us to the other.\a147Now, my fine fellow,\a148 said Stanley Hopkins, \a147who are you, and what do you want here?\a148The man pulled himself together and faced us with an effort at self-composure.\a147You are detectives, I suppose?\a148 said he. \a147You imagine I am connected with the death of Captain Peter Carey. I assure you that I am innocent.\a148\a147We\a146ll see about that,\a148 said Hopkins. \a147First of all, what is your name?\a148\a147It is John Hopley Neligan.\a148I saw Holmes and Hopkins exchange a quick glance.\a147What are you doing here?\a148\a147Can I speak confidentially?\a148\a147No, certainly not.\a148\a147Why should I tell you?\a148\a147If you have no answer it may go badly with you at the trial.\a148The young man winced.\a147Well, I will tell you,\a148 he said. \a147Why should I not. And yet I hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. Did you ever hear of Dawson and Neligan?\a148I could see from Hopkins\a146s face that he never had; but Holmes was keenly interested.\a147You mean the West-country bankers,\a148 said he. \a147They failed for a million, ruined half the county families of Cornwall, and Neligan disappeared.\a148\a147Exactly. Neligan was my father.\a148At last we were getting something positive, and yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons. We all listened intently to the young man\a146s words.\a147It was my father who was really concerned. Dawson had retired. I was only ten years of age at the time, but I was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all. It has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled. It is not true. It was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them all would be well and every creditor paid in full. He started in his little yacht for Norway just before the warrant was issued for his arrest. I can remember that last night when he bade farewell to my mother. He left us a list of the securities he was taking, and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared, and that none who had trusted him would suffer. Well, no word was ever heard from him again. Both the yacht and he vanished utterly. We believed, my mother and I, that he and it, with the securities that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of the sea. We had a faithful friend, however, who is a business man, and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him have reappeared on the London market. You can imagine our amazement. I spent months in trying to trace them, and at last, after many doublings and difficulties, I discovered that the original seller had been Captain Peter Carey, the owner of this hut.\a147Naturally, I made some inquiries about the man. I found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to Norway. The autumn of that year was a stormy one, and there was a long succession of southerly gales. My father\a146s yacht may well have been blown to the north, and there met by Captain Peter Carey\a146s ship. If that were so, what had become of my father. In any case, if I could prove from Peter Carey\a146s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them.\a147I came down to Sussex with the intention of seeing the captain, but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred. I read at the inquest a description of his cabin, in which it stated that the old log-books of his vessel were preserved in it. It struck me that if I could see what occurred in the month of August, 1883, on board the \iSea Unicorn\i, I might settle the mystery of my father\a146s fate. I tried last night to get at these log-books, but was unable to open the door. To-night I tried again, and succeeded; but I find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book. It was at that moment I found myself a prisoner in your hands.\a148\a147Is that all?\a148 asked Hopkins.\a147Yes, that is all\a148. His eyes shifted as he said it.\a147You have nothing else to tell us?\a148He hesitated.\a147No; there is nothing.\a148\a147You have not been here before last night?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Then how do you account for \ithat\i?\a148 cried Hopkins, as he held up the damning note-book, with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the blood-stain on the cover.The wretched man collapsed. He sank his face in his hands and trembled all over.\a147Where did you get it?\a148 he groaned. \a147I did not know. I thought I had lost it at the hotel.\a148\a147That is enough,\a148 said Hopkins, sternly. \a147Whatever else you have to say you must say in court. You will walk down with me now to the police-station. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me. As it turns out your presence was unnecessary, and I would have brought the case to this successful issue without you; but none the less I am very grateful. Rooms have been reserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can all walk down to the village together.\a148\a147Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\a148 asked Holmes, as we travelled back next morning.\a147I can see that you are not satisfied.\a148\a147Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satisfied. At the same time Stanley Hopkins\a146s methods do not commend themselves to me. I am disappointed in Stanley Hopkins. I had hoped for better things from him. One should always look for a possible alternative and provide against it. It is the first rule of criminal investigation.\a148\a147What, then, is the alternative?\a148\a147The line of investigation which I have myself been pursuing. It may give us nothing. I cannot tell. But at least I shall follow it to the end.\a148Several letters were waiting for Holmes at Baker Street. He snatched one of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter.\a147Excellent, Watson. The alternative develops. Have you telegraph forms. Just write a couple of messages for me. \a145Sumner, Shipping Agent, Ratcliff Highway. Send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow morning.Basil.\a146 That\a146s my name in those parts. The other is. \a145Inspector Stanley Hopkins, 46, Lord Street, Brixton. Come breakfast to-morrow at nine-thirty. Important. Wire if unable to come.\a146Sherlock Holmes\a148. There, Watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days. I hereby banish it completely from my presence. To-morrow I trust that we shall hear the last of it for ever.\a148Sharp at the hour named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared, and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared. The young detective was in high spirits at his success.\a147You really think that your solution must be correct?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I could not imagine a more complete case.\a148\a147It did not seem to me conclusive.\a148\a147You astonish me, Mr. Holmes. What more could one ask for?\a148\a147Does your explanation cover every point?\a148\a147Undoubtedly. I find that young Neligan arrived at the Brambletye Hotel on the very day of the crime. He came on the pretence of playing golf. His room was on the ground-floor, and he could get out when he liked. That very night he went down to Woodman\a146s Lee, saw Peter Carey at the hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him with the harpoon. Then, horrified by what he had done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the note-book which he had brought with him in order to question Peter Carey about these different securities. You may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks, and the others\a151 the great majority\a151 were not. Those which are ticked have been traced on the London market; but the others presumably were still in the possession of Carey, and young Neligan, according to his own account, was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father\a146s creditors. After his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time; but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed. Surely that is all simple and obvious?\a148Holmes smiled and shook his head.\a147It seems to me to have only one drawback, Hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impossible. Have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body. No. Tut, tut, my dear sir, you must really pay attention to these details. My friend Watson could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise. It is no easy matter, and requires a strong and practised arm. But this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall. Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault. Is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with Black Peter in the dead of the night. Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before. No, no, Hopkins; it is another and a more formidable person for whom we must seek.\a148The detective\a146s face had grown longer and longer during Holmes\a146s speech. His hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him. But he would not abandon his position without a struggle.\a147You can\a146t deny that Neligan was present that night, Mr. Holmes. The book will prove that. I fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a jury, even if you are able to pick a hole in it. Besides, Mr. Holmes, I have laid my hand upon \imy\i man. As to this terrible person of yours, where is he?\a148\a147I rather fancy that he is on the stair,\a148 said Holmes, serenely. \a147I think, Watson, that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it\a148. He rose, and laid a written paper upon a side-table. \a147Now we are ready,\a148 said he.There had been some talking in gruff voices outside, and now Mrs. Hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for Captain Basil.\a147Show them in one by one,\a148 said Holmes.The first who entered was a little ribston-pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white side-whiskers. Holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket.\a147What name?\a148 he asked.\a147James Lancaster.\a148\a147I am sorry, Lancaster, but the berth is full. Here is half a sovereign for your trouble. Just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes.\a148The second man was a long, dried-up creature, with lank hair and sallow cheeks. His name was Hugh Pattins. He also received his dismissal, his half-sovereign, and the order to wait.The third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance. A fierce bull-dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows. He saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turning his cap round in his hands.\a147Your name?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Patrick Cairns.\a148\a147Harpooner?\a148\a147Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages.\a148\a147Dundee, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And ready to start with an exploring ship?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147What wages?\a148\a147Eight pounds a month.\a148\a147Could you start at once?\a148\a147As soon as I get my kit.\a148\a147Have you your papers?\a148\a147Yes, sir\a148. He took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket. Holmes glanced over them and returned them.\a147You are just the man I want,\a148 said he. \a147Here\a146s the agreement on the side-table. If you sign it the whole matter will be settled.\a148The seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen.\a147Shall I sign here?\a148 he asked, stooping over the table.Holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck.\a147This will do,\a148 said he.I heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull. The next instant Holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together. He was a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the handcuffs which Holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists, he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed to his rescue. Only when I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last understand that resistance was vain. We lashed his ankles with cord and rose breathless from the struggle.\a147I must really apologize, Hopkins,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes; \a147I fear that the scrambled eggs are cold. However, you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better, will you not, for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion.\a148Stanley Hopkins was speechless with amazement.\a147I don\a146t know what to say, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he blurted out at last, with a very red face. \a147It seems to me that I have been making a fool of myself from the beginning. I understand now, what I should never have forgotten, that I am the pupil and you are the master. Even now I see what you have done, but I don\a146t know how you did it, or what it signifies.\a148\a147Well, well,\a148 said Holmes, good-humouredly. \a147We all learn by experience, and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative. You were so absorbed in young Neligan that you could not spare a thought to Patrick Cairns, the true murderer of Peter Carey.\a148The hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation.\a147See here, mister,\a148 said he, \a147I make no complaint of being man-handled in this fashion, but I would have you call things by their right names. You say I murdered Peter Carey; I say I \ikilled\i Peter Carey, and there\a146s all the difference. Maybe you don\a146t believe what I say. Maybe you think I am just slinging you a yarn.\a148\a147Not at all,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Let us hear what you have to say.\a148\a147It\a146s soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of it is truth. I knew Black Peter, and when he pulled out his knife I whipped a harpoon through him sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. That\a146s how he died. You can call it murder. Anyhow, I\a146d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with Black Peter\a146s knife in my heart.\a148\a147How came you there?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I\a146ll tell it you from the beginning. Just sit me up a little so as I can speak easy. It was in \a14683 that it happened\a151 August of that year. Peter Carey was master of the \iSea Unicorn\i, and I was spare harpooner. We were coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week\a146s southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. There was one man on her\a151 a landsman. The crew had thought she would founder, and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All the baggage we took off with him was one tin box. So far as I know, the man\a146s name was never mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been. It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. Only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for with my own eyes I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the Shetland lights.\a147Well, I kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see what would come of it. When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by an accident, and it was nobody\a146s business to inquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. I guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut.\a147I found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in London, and down I went to squeeze him. The first night he was reasonable enough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life. We were to fix it all two nights later. When I came I found him three parts drunk and in a vile temper. We sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times, but the more he drank the less I liked the look on his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and I thought I might need it before I was through. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his hand. He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon through him. Heavens! what a yell he gave; and his face gets between me and my sleep. I stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and I waited for a bit; but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I looked round, and there was the tin box on a shelf. I had as much right to it as Peter Carey, anyhow, so I took it with me and left the hut. Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.\a147Now I\a146ll tell you the queerest part of the whole story. I had hardly got outside the hut when I heard someone coming, and I hid among the bushes. A man came slinking along, went into the hut, gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost, and legged it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight. Who he was or what he wanted is more than I can tell. For my part I walked ten miles, got a train at Tunbridge Wells, and so reached London, and no one the wiser.\a147Well, when I came to examine the box I found there was no money in it, and nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold on Black Peter, and was stranded in London without a shilling. There was only my trade left. I saw these advertisements about harpooners and high wages, so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here. That\a146s all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter the law should give me thanks, for I saved them the price of a hempen rope.\a148\a147A very clear statement,\a148 said Holmes, rising and lighting his pipe. \a147I think, Hopkins, that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety. This room is not well adapted for a cell, and Mr. Patrick Cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Hopkins, \a147I do not know how to express my gratitude. Even now I do not understand how you attained this result.\a148\a147Simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning. It is very possible if I had known about this note-book it might have led away my thoughts, as it did yours. But all I heard pointed in the one direction. The amazing strength, the skill in the use of the harpoon, the rum and water, the seal-skin tobacco-pouch, with the coarse tobacco\a151 all these pointed to a seaman, and one who had been a whaler. I was convinced that the initials \a145P.C.\a146 upon the pouch were a coincidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked, and no pipe was found in his cabin. You remember that I asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin. You said they were. How many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits. Yes, I was certain it was a seaman.\a148\a147And how did you find him?\a148\a147My dear sir, the problem had become a very simple one. If it were a seaman, it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the \iSea Unicorn\i. So far as I could learn he had sailed in no other ship. I spent three days in wiring to Dundee, and at the end of that time I had ascertained the names of the crew of the \iSea Unicorn\i in 1883. When I found Patrick Cairns among the harpooners my research was nearing its end. I argued that the man was probably in London, and that he would desire to leave the country for a time. I therefore spent some days in the East-end, devised an Arctic expedition, put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under Captain Basil\a151 and behold the result!\a148\a147Wonderful!\a148 cried Hopkins. \a147Wonderful!\a148\a147You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I confess that I think you owe him some apology. The tin box must be returned to him, but, of course, the securities which Peter Carey has sold are lost for ever. There\a146s the cab, Hopkins, and you can remove your man. If you want me for the trial, my address and that of Watson will be somewhere in Norway\a151 I\a146ll send particulars later.\a148\p\X1\BCharles Augustus Milverton\B\X1\c\i\m="chas-01.png"\i\cIt is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it is with diffidence that I allude to them. For a long time, even with the utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make the facts public; but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The reader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence.We had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had returned about six o\a146clock on a cold, frosty winter\a146s evening. As Holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor. I picked it up and read:\a151\c\i\m="cam.png"\i\c\a147Who is he?\a148 I asked.\a147The worst man in London,\a148 Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire. \a147Is anything on the back of the card?\a148I turned it over.\a147Will call at 6.30C.A.M.,\a148 I read.\a147Hum. He\a146s about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation, Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo and see the slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and wicked, flattened faces. Well, that\a146s how Milverton impresses me. I\a146ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can\a146t get out of doing business with him\a151 indeed, he is here at my invitation.\a148\a147But who is he?\a148\a147I\a146ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come into the power of Milverton. With a smiling face and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade. His method is as follows. He allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth or position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard hand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was the result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning. I have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?\a148I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.\a147But surely,\a148 said I, \a147the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?\a148\a147Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a woman, for example, to get him a few months\a146 imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow. His victims dare not hit back. If ever he blackmailed an innocent person, then, indeed, we should have him; but he is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no; we must find other ways to fight him.\a148\a147And why is he here?\a148\a147Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands. It is the Lady Eva Brackwell, the most beautiful \id\a233butante\i of last season. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt. This fiend has several imprudent letters\a151 imprudent, Watson, nothing worse\a151 which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country. They would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been commissioned to meet him, and\a151 to make the best terms I can.\a148At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below. Looking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A footman opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended. A minute later he was in the room.Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large, intellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen smile, and two keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad, golden-rimmed glasses. There was something of Mr. Pickwick\a146s benevolence in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. Milverton\a146s smile broadened; he shrugged his shoulders, removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair, and then took a seat.\a147This gentleman?\a148 said he, with a wave in my direction. \a147Is it discreet. Is it right?\a148\a147Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.\a148\a147Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your client\a146s interests that I protested. The matter is so very delicate\a151\a151\a148\a147Dr. Watson has already heard of it.\a148\a147Then we can proceed to business. You say that you are acting for Lady Eva. Has she empowered you to accept my terms?\a148\a147What are your terms?\a148\a147Seven thousand pounds.\a148\a147And the alternative?\a148\a147My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it; but if the money is not paid on the 14th there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th\a148. His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever.Holmes thought for a little.\a147You appear to me,\a148 he said, at last, \a147to be taking matters too much for granted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters. My client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.\a148Milverton chuckled.\a147You evidently do not know the Earl,\a148 said he.From the baffled look upon Holmes\a146s face I could see clearly that he did.\a147What harm is there in the letters?\a148 he asked.\a147They are sprightly\a151 very sprightly,\a148 Milverton answered. \a147The lady was a charming correspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of Dovercourt would fail to appreciate them. However, since you think otherwise, we will let it rest at that. It is purely a matter of business. If you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them\a148. He rose and seized his astrakhan coat.Holmes was grey with anger and mortification.\a147Wait a little,\a148 he said. \a147You go too fast. We would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.\a148Milverton relapsed into his chair.\a147I was sure that you would see it in that light,\a148 he purred.\a147At the same time,\a148 Holmes continued, \a147Lady Eva is not a wealthy woman. I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. I beg, therefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return the letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest that you can get.\a148Milverton\a146s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously.\a147I am aware that what you say is true about the lady\a146s resources,\a148 said he. \a147At the same time, you must admit that the occasion of a lady\a146s marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf. They may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present. Let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes in London.\a148\a147It is impossible,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!\a148 cried Milverton, taking out a bulky pocket-book. \a147I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in not making an effort. Look at this!. He held up a little note with a coat-of-arms upon the envelope. \a147That belongs to\a151 well, perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. But at that time it will be in the hands of the lady\a146s husband. And all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste. It \iis\i such a pity. Now, you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking. Only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the \iMorning Post\i to say that it was all off. And why. It is almost incredible, but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question. Is it not pitiful. And here I find you, a man of sense, boggling about terms when your client\a146s future and honour are at stake. You surprise me, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147What I say is true,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147The money cannot be found. Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman\a146s career, which can profit you in no way?\a148\a147There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\a148Holmes sprang from his chair.\a147Get behind him, Watson. Don\a146t let him out. Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\a148Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\a147Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \a147I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it. I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead\a148. He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \a147I\a146ll be back some time, Watson,\a148 said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.For some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\a147You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\a148\a147No, indeed!\a148\a147You\a146ll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\a148\a147My dear fellow. I congrat\a151\a151\a148\a147To Milverton\a146s housemaid.\a148\a147Good heavens, Holmes!\a148\a147I wanted information, Watson.\a148\a147Surely you have gone too far?\a148\a147It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber with a rising business, Escott by name. I have walked out with her each evening, and I have talked with her. Good heavens, those talks. However, I have got all I wanted. I know Milverton\a146s house as I know the palm of my hand.\a148\a147But the girl, Holmes?\a148He shrugged his shoulders.\a147You can\a146t help it, my dear Watson. You must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that I have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned. What a splendid night it is!\a148\a147You like this weather?\a148\a147It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton\a146s house to-night.\a148I had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words, which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wide landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result of such an action\a151 the detection, the capture, the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious Milverton.\a147For Heaven\a146s sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,\a148 I cried.\a147My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never precipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and indeed so dangerous a course if any other were possible. Let us look at the matter clearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocket-book\a151 an action in which you were prepared to aid me.\a148I turned it over in my mind.\a147Yes,\a148 I said; \a147it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.\a148\a147Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable I have only to consider the question of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?\a148\a147You will be in such a false position.\a148\a147Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of regaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and there are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. I must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or I must play this last card. Between ourselves, Watson, it\a146s a sporting duel between this fellow Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best of the first exchanges; but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t like it; but I suppose it must be,\a148 said I. \a147When do we start?\a148\a147You are not coming.\a148\a147Then you are not going,\a148 said I. \a147I give you my word of honour\a151 and I never broke it in my life\a151 that I will take a cab straight to the police-station and give you away unless you let me share this adventure with you.\a148\a147You can\a146t help me.\a148\a147How do you know that. You can\a146t tell what may happen. Anyway, my resolution is taken. Other people beside you have self-respect and even reputations.\a148Holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on the shoulder.\a147Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We have shared the same room for some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell. You know, Watson, I don\a146t mind confessing to you that I have always had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal. This is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. See here!. He took a neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited a number of shining instruments. \a147This is a first-class, up-to-date burgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter, adaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands. Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in order. Have you a pair of silent shoes?\a148\a147I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.\a148\a147Excellent. And a mask?\a148\a147I can make a couple out of black silk.\a148\a147I can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing. Very good; do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before we start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as Church Row. It is a quarter of an hour\a146s walk from there to Appledore Towers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy sleeper and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With any luck we should be back here by two, with the Lady Eva\a146s letters in my pocket.\a148Holmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two theatre-goers homeward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in Hampstead. Here we paid off our cab, and with our great-coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold and the wind seemed to blow through us, we walked along the edge of the Heath.\a147It\a146s a business that needs delicate treatment,\a148 said Holmes. \a147These documents are contained in a safe in the fellow\a146s study, and the study is the ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand, like all these stout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper. Agatha\a151 that\a146s my \ifianc\a233\i says it is a joke in the servants\a146 hall that it\a146s impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted to his interests and never budges from the study all day. That\a146s why we are going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. I met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own grounds. Through the gate\a151 now to the right among the laurels. We might put on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.\a148With our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house. A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several windows and two doors.\a147That\a146s his bedroom,\a148 Holmes whispered. \a147This door opens straight into the study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked, and we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There\a146s a greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.\a148The place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick, warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. Holmes had remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark. Still holding my hand in one of his he opened a door, and I was vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before. He felt his way among the furniture, opened another door, and closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt several coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a passage. We passed along it, and Holmes very gently opened a door upon the right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat. A fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke. Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and then very gently closed the door. We were in Milverton\a146s study, and a \iporti\a232re\i at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom.It was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. Near the door I saw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it had been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain, which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. On the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda. A desk stood in the centre, with a turning chair of shining red leather. Opposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on the top. In the corner between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its face. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then he crept to the door of the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. No sound came from within. Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door, so I examined it. To my amazement it was neither locked nor bolted. I touched Holmes on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that direction. I saw him start, and he was evidently as surprised as I.\a147I don\a146t like it,\a148 he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. \a147I can\a146t quite make it out. Anyhow, we have no time to lose.\a148\a147Can I do anything?\a148\a147Yes; stand by the door. If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside, and we can get away as we came. If they come the other way, we can get through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window curtains if it is not. Do you understand?\a148I nodded and stood by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. The high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat\a151 he had placed his overcoat on a chair\a151 Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others, ready for any emergency; though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For half an hour Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same.It was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed his quicker senses. There was a noise somewhere within the house. A door slammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in the passage outside the room. They paused at the door. The door opened. There was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. The door closed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne to our nostrils. Then the footsteps continued backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, within a few yards of us. Finally, there was a creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a lock and I heard the rustle of papers.So far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through. From the pressure of Holmes\a146s shoulder against mine I knew that he was sharing my observations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long legal document, which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.I felt Holmes\a146s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as if to say that the situation was within his powers and that he was easy in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly closed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In my own mind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his gaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my great-coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. But Milverton never looked up. He was languidly interested by the papers in his hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer. At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room; but before he had reached the end of either there came a remarkable development which turned our thoughts into quite another channel.Several times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and once he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The idea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair. The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the door. Milverton rose and opened it.\a147Well,\a148 said he, curtly, \a147you are nearly half an hour late.\a148So this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of Milverton. There was the gentle rustle of a woman\a146s dress. I had closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton\a146s face had turned in our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once more. He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of his mouth. In front of him, in the full glare of the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over her face, a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came quick and fast, and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion.\a147Well,\a148 said Milverton, \a147you\a146ve made me lose a good night\a146s rest, my dear. I hope you\a146ll prove worth it. You couldn\a146t come any other time\a151 eh?\a148The woman shook her head.\a147Well, if you couldn\a146t you couldn\a146t. If the Countess is a hard mistress you have your chance to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are you shivering about. That\a146s right. Pull yourself together. Now, let us get down to business\a148. He took a note from the drawer of his desk. \a147You say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess d\a146Albert. You want to sell them. I want to buy them. So far so good. It only remains to fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of course. If they are really good specimens\a151- Great heavens, is it you?\a148The woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin. It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted Milverton, a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading hard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a dangerous smile.\a147It is I,\a148 she said; \a147the woman whose life you have ruined.\a148Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. \a147You were so very obstinate,\a148 said he. \a147Why did you drive me to such extremities. I assure you I wouldn\a146t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his business, and what was I to do. I put the price well within your means. You would not pay.\a148\a147So you sent the letters to my husband, and he\a151 the noblest gentleman that ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace\a151 he broke his gallant heart and died. You remember that last night when I came through that door I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching. Yes, you never thought to see me here again, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face to face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?\a148\a147Don\a146t imagine that you can bully me,\a148 said he, rising to his feet. \a147I have only to raise my voice, and I could call my servants and have you arrested. But I will make allowance for your natural anger. Leave the room at once as you came, and I will say no more.\a148The woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly smile on her thin lips.\a147You will ruin no more lives as you ruined mine. You will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine. I will free the world of a poisonous thing. Take that, you hound, and that! and that! and that!\a148She had drawn a little, gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after barrel into Milverton\a146s body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front. He shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, coughing furiously and clawing among the papers. Then he staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. \a147You\a146ve done me,\a148 he cried, and lay still. The woman looked at him intently and ground her heel into his upturned face. She looked again, but there was no sound or movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated room, and the avenger was gone.No interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate; but as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton\a146s shrinking body I was about to spring out, when I felt Holmes\a146s cold, strong grasp upon my wrist. I understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining grip\a151 that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain; that we had our own duties and our own objects which were not to be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when Holmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. He turned the key in the lock. At the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet. The revolver shots had roused the household. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe, filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into the fire. Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. Someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. Holmes looked swiftly round. The letter which had been the messenger of death for Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. Holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers. Then he drew the key from the outer door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. \a147This way, Watson,\a148 said he; \a147we can scale the garden wall in this direction.\a148I could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly. Looking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. The front door was open, and figures were rushing down the drive. The whole garden was alive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels. Holmes seemed to know the ground perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting behind us. It was a six-foot wall which barred our path, but he sprang to the top and over. As I did the same I felt the hand of the man behind me grab at my ankle; but I kicked myself free and scrambled over a glass-strewn coping. I fell upon my face among some bushes; but Holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of Hampstead Heath. We had run two miles, I suppose, before Holmes at last halted and listened intently. All was absolute silence behind us. We had shaken off our pursuers and were safe.We had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after the remarkable experience which I have recorded when Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, very solemn and impressive, was ushered into our modest sitting-room.\a147Good morning, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he; \a147good morning. May I ask if you are very busy just now?\a148\a147Not too busy to listen to you.\a148\a147I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case which occurred only last night at Hampstead.\a148\a147Dear me!\a148 said Holmes. \a147What was that?\a148\a147A murder\a151 a most dramatic and remarkable murder. I know how keen you are upon these things, and I would take it as a great favour if you would step down to Appledore Towers and give us the benefit of your advice. It is no ordinary crime. We have had our eyes upon this Mr. Milverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a villain. He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes. These papers have all been burned by the murderers. No article of value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure.\a148\a147Criminals!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Plural!\a148\a147Yes, there were two of them. They were, as nearly as possible, captured red-handed. We have their foot-marks, we have their description; it\a146s ten to one that we trace them. The first fellow was a bit too active, but the second was caught by the under-gardener and only got away after a struggle. He was a middle-sized, strongly-built man\a151 square jaw, thick neck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.\a148\a147That\a146s rather vague,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147Why, it might be a description of Watson!\a148\a147It\a146s true,\a148 said the inspector, with much amusement. \a147It might be a description of Watson.\a148\a147Well, I am afraid I can\a146t help you, Lestrade,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The fact is that I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him one of the most dangerous men in London, and that I think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge. No, it\a146s no use arguing. I have made up my mind. My sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim, and I will not handle this case.\a148Holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed, but I observed all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner, of a man who is striving to recall something to his memory. We were in the middle of our lunch when he suddenly sprang to his feet. \a147By Jove, Watson; I\a146ve got it!\a148 he cried. \a147Take your hat. Come with me!. He hurried at his top speed down Baker Street and along Oxford Street, until we had almost reached Regent Circus. Here on the left hand there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day. Holmes\a146s eyes fixed themselves upon one of them, and following his gaze I saw the picture of a regal and stately lady in Court dress, with a high diamond tiara upon her noble head. I looked at that delicately-curved nose, at the marked eyebrows, at the straight mouth, and the strong little chin beneath it. Then I caught my breath as I read the time-honoured title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been. My eyes met those of Holmes, and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window.\p\X1\BThe Six Napoleons\B\X1\c\i\m="sixn-05.png"\i\cIt was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police head-quarters. In return for the news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.On this particular evening Lestrade had spoken of the weather and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.\a147Anything remarkable on hand?\a148 he asked.\a147Oh, no, Mr. Holmes, nothing very particular.\a148\a147Then tell me about it.\a148Lestrade laughed.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there \iis\i something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business that I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common. But in my opinion it comes more in Dr. Watson\a146s line than ours.\a148\a147Disease?\a148 said I.\a147Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness too. You wouldn\a146t think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that he could see.\a148Holmes sank back in his chair.\a147That\a146s no business of mine,\a148 said he.\a147Exactly. That\a146s what I said. But then, when the man commits burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.\a148Holmes sat up again.\a147Burglary. This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.\a148Lestrade took out his official note-book and refreshed his memory from its pages.\a147The first case reported was four days ago,\a148 said he. \a147It was at the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had left the front shop for an instant when he heard a crash, and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although several passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.\a147The second case, however, was more serious and also more singular. It occurred only last night.\a147In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson\a146s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner, named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames. His residence and principal consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away. This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Emperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered fragments were discovered.\a148Holmes rubbed his hands.\a147This is certainly very novel,\a148 said he.\a147I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o\a146clock, and you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been opened in the night, and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got the facts.\a148\a147They are singular, not to say grotesque,\a148 said Holmes. \a147May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot\a146s rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse Hudson\a146s shop?\a148\a147They were taken from the same mould.\a148\a147Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in London, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust.\a148\a147Well, I thought as you do,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147On the other hand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of London, and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many hundreds of statues in London, it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?\a148\a147There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,\a148 I answered. \a147There is the condition which the modern French psychologists have called the \iid\a233e fixe\i, which may be trifling in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great war, might conceivably form such an \iid\a233e fixe\i and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.\a148\a147That won\a146t do, my dear Watson,\a148 said Holmes, shaking his head; \a147for no amount of \iid\a233e fixe\i would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.\a148\a147Well, how do \iyou\i explain it?\a148\a147I don\a146t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentleman\a146s eccentric proceedings. For example, in Dr. Barnicot\a146s hall, where a sound might arouse the family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can\a146t afford, therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh developments of so singular a chain of events.\a148The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning when there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:\a151\a147Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.Lestrade.\a148\a147What is it, then?\a148 I asked.\a147Don\a146t know\a151 may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues. In that case our friend, the image-breaker, has begun operations in another quarter of London. There\a146s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the door.\a148In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London life. No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up we found the railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes whistled.\a147By George! it\a146s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will hold the London message-boy. There\a146s a deed of violence indicated in that fellow\a146s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What\a146s this, Watson. The top steps swilled down and the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, anyhow. Well, well, there\a146s Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know all about it.\a148The official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house\a151 Mr. Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.\a147It\a146s the Napoleon bust business again,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147You seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn.\a148\a147What has it turned to, then?\a148\a147To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred?\a148The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face.\a147It\a146s an extraordinary thing,\a148 said he, \a147that all my life I have been collecting other people\a146s news, and now that a real piece of news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can\a146t put two words together. If I had come in here as a journalist I should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. As it is I am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people, and I can make no use of it myself. However, I\a146ve heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you\a146ll only explain this queer business I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story.\a148Holmes sat down and listened.\a147It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night, and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house, about three o\a146clock, when I was convinced that I heard some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated, and I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell\a151 the most dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.\a147You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride. This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and opened the door. Stepping out into the dark I nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there. I ran back for a light, and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman standing over me in the hall.\a148\a147Well, who was the murdered man?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147There\a146s nothing to show who he was,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147You shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it is.\a148It was evidently taken by a snap-shot from a small camera. It represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man with thick eyebrows, and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the face like the muzzle of a baboon.\a147And what became of the bust?\a148 asked Holmes, after a careful study of this picture.\a147We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you come?\a148\a147Certainly. I must just take one look round\a148. He examined the carpet and the window. \a147The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man,\a148 said he. \a147With an area beneath, it was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that window. Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?\a148The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.\a147I must try and make something of it,\a148 said he, \a147though I have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details. It\a146s like my luck. You remember when the stand fell at Doncaster. Well, I was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to write it. And now I\a146ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep.\a148As we left the room we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the foolscap.The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon this presentment of the great Emperor, which seemed to raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay scattered in splintered shards upon the grass. Holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully. I was convinced from his intent face and his purposeful manner that at last he was upon a clue.\a147Well?\a148 asked Lestrade.Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147We have a long way to go yet,\a148 said he. \a147And yet\a151 and yet\a151 well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of this strange criminal than a human life. That is one point. Then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object.\a148\a147He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He hardly knew what he was doing.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of which the bust was destroyed.\a148Lestrade looked about him.\a147It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden.\a148\a147Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?\a148\a147I give it up,\a148 said Lestrade.Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.\a147He could see what he was doing here and he could not there. That was his reason.\a148\a147By Jove! that\a146s true,\a148 said the detective. \a147Now that I come to think of it, Dr. Barnicot\a146s bust was broken not far from his red lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?\a148\a147To remember it\a151 to docket it. We may come on something later which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?\a148\a147The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that. When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don\a146t you think so?\a148\a147No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should approach the case.\a148\a147What would you do, then?\a148\a147Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each will supplement the other.\a148\a147Very good,\a148 said Lestrade.\a147If you are going back to Pitt Street you might see Mr. Horace Harker. Tell him from me that I have quite made up my mind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with Napoleonic delusions was in his house last night. It will be useful for his article.\a148Lestrade stared.\a147You don\a146t seriously believe that?\a148Holmes smiled.\a147Don\a146t I. Well, perhaps I don\a146t. But I am sure that it will interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day\a146s work before us. I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o\a146clock this evening. Until then I should like to keep this photograph found in the dead man\a146s pocket. It is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then, good-bye and good luck!\a148Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where he stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be absent until after noon, and that he was himself a newcomer who could give us no information. Holmes\a146s face showed his disappointment and annoyance.\a147Well, well, we can\a146t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,\a148 he said, at last. \a147We must come back in the afternoon if Mr. Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light upon the problem.\a148A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer\a146s establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner.\a147Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,\a148 said he. \a147What we pay rates and taxes for I don\a146t know, when any ruffian can come in and break one\a146s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues. Disgraceful, sir. A Nihilist plot, that\a146s what I make it. No one but an Anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red republicans, that\a146s what I call \a145em. Who did I get the statues from. I don\a146t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder and Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years. How many had I. Three\a151 two and one are three\a151 two of Dr. Barnicot\a146s and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph. No, I don\a146t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it\a146s Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I\a146ve heard nothing of him since. No, I don\a146t know where he came from nor where he went to. I have nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days before the bust was smashed.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s all we could reasonably expect to get from Morse Hudson,\a148 said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. \a147We have this Beppo as a common factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder and Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of busts. I shall be surprised if we don\a146t get some help down there.\a148In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London, commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry. Inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly, and gave a clear answer to all Holmes\a146s questions. A reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine\a146s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different to any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them\a151 in fact, he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work was usually done by Italians in the room we were in. When finished the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell us.But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his blue Teutonic eyes.\a147Ah, the rascal!\a148 he cried. \a147Yes, indeed, I know him very well. This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his name\a151 his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging a man with such a face. But he was a good workman, one of the best.\a148\a147What did he get?\a148\a147The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is out now; but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a cousin of his here, and I dare say he could tell you where he is.\a148\a147No, no,\a148 cried Holmes, \a147not a word to the cousin\a151 not a word, I beg you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go with it the more important it seems to grow. When you referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date when Beppo was arrested?\a148\a147I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,\a148 the manager answered. \a147Yes,\a148 he continued, after some turning over of pages, \a147he was paid last on May 20th.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I don\a146t think that I need intrude upon your time and patience any more\a148. With a last word of caution that he should say nothing as to our researches we turned our faces westward once more.The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance announced \a147Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,\a148 and the contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident. Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he ate. Once or twice he chuckled.\a147This is all right, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Listen to this: \a145It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most experienced members of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration can cover the facts\a148. The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution if you only know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding Brothers has to say to the matter.\a148The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue.\a147Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers. Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder and Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom. Oh, I dare say by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker, you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I\a146ve seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff. Yes, sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I dare say they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it\a146s a very strange business, and I hope that you\a146ll let me know if anything comes of your inquiries.\a148Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding\a146s evidence, and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were taking. He made no remark, however, save that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street the detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever of impatience. His look of importance showed that his day\a146s work had not been in vain.\a147Well?\a148 he asked. \a147What luck, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,\a148 my friend explained. \a147We have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from the beginning.\a148\a147The busts!\a148 cried Lestrade. \a147Well, well, you have your own methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word against them, but I think I have done a better day\a146s work than you. I have identified the dead man.\a148\a147You don\a146t say so?\a148\a147And found a cause for the crime.\a148\a147Splendid!\a148\a147We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.\a147Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!\a148 he cried. \a147But I didn\a146t quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.\a148\a147The busts. You never can get those busts out of your head. After all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.\a148\a147And the next stage?\a148\a147Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?\a148\a147I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can\a146t say for certain, because it all depends\a151 well, it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great hopes\a151 in fact, the betting is exactly two to one\a151 that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels.\a148\a147In the Italian quarter?\a148\a147No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I\a146ll promise to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours\a146 sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o\a146clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You\a146ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and it is important that it should go at once.\a148Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his favourite weapon.A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light of a street lamp we read \a147Laburnum Villa\a148 upon the gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.\a147I fear that you\a146ll have a long wait,\a148 Holmes whispered. \a147We may thank our stars that it is not raining. I don\a146t think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it\a146s a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.\a148It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was making his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then through another.\a147Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,\a148 Lestrade whispered.But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and the handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured.But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.\a147Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I had the note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments. Well, I\a146m very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment.\a148However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.\a147That\a146s all right,\a148 said Lestrade, as we parted. \a147Hill knows all these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You\a146ll find that my theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I\a146m sure I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him. I don\a146t quite understand it all yet.\a148\a147I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o\a146clock to-morrow I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts.\a148When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne\a146er-do-well among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in gaol\a151 once for a petty theft and once, as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder and Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.\a147Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\a148My friend bowed and smiled. \a147Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147I have your letter here. You said, \a145I desire to possess a copy of Devine\a146s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession\a148. Is that right?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.\a148\a147Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.\a148\a147Oh, that was it, was it. Did he tell you what I paid for it?\a148\a147No, he did not.\a148\a147Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that before I take ten pounds from you.\a148\a147I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have named that price, so I intend to stick to it.\a148\a147Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!. He opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments.Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon the table.\a147You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good evening.\a148When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes\a146s movements were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.\a147Gentlemen,\a148 he cried, \a147let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the Borgias.\a148Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes\a146s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.\a147Yes, gentlemen,\a148 said he, \a147it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna\a146s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder and Co., of Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connection between them. The maid\a146s name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo for some crime of violence, an event which took place in the factory of Gelder and Co., at the very moment when these busts were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro\a146s confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.\a147The main fact is that he \ihad\i the pearl, and at that moment, when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year\a146s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it\a151 as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there. Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker\a146s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed.\a148\a147If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?\a148 I asked.\a147As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker\a146s bust. I had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker\a146s bust was one in three the chances were exactly as I told you, two to one against the pearl being inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other. There only remained a single bust\a151 the Reading one\a151 and the pearl must be there. I bought it in your presence from the owner\a151 and there it lies.\a148We sat in silence for a moment.\a147Well,\a148 said Lestrade, \a147I\a146ve seen you handle a good many cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don\a146t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that. We\a146re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there\a146s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn\a146t be glad to shake you by the hand.\a148\a147Thank you!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Thank you!\a148 and as he turned away it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more. \a147Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your way I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution.\a148\p\X1\BThe Three Students\B\X1\c\i\m="3stu-02.png"\i\cIt was in the year \a14695 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details which would help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early English charters\a151 researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. Here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke\a146s. Mr. Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred.\a147I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke\a146s, and really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should have been at a loss what to do.\a148\a147I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,\a148 my friend answered. \a147I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police.\a148\a147No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can.\a148My friend\a146s temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without his scrap-books, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.\a147I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not seen. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance. For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper secret.\a147To-day about three o\a146clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend\a146s rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an hour.\a147You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double\a151 a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences.\a147The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third was where I had left it.\a148Holmes stirred for the first time.\a147The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it,\a148 said he.\a147Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know that?\a148\a147Pray continue your very interesting statement.\a148\a147For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.\a147Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I made a most careful examination of the room. I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers. On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened. A broken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case. \a147Fortune has been your friend.\a148\a147This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long\a151 not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough, or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at my wits\a146 ends, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not only on the college, but on the University. Above all things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly.\a148\a147I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I can,\a148 said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. \a147The case is not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you?\a148\a147Yes; young Daulat Ras, an Indian student who lives on the same stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination.\a148\a147For which he was entered?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And the papers were on your table?\a148\a147To the best of my belief they were rolled up.\a148\a147But might be recognised as proofs?\a148\a147Possibly.\a148\a147No one else in your room?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?\a148\a147No one save the printer.\a148\a147Did this man Bannister know?\a148\a147No, certainly not. No one knew.\a148\a147Where is Bannister now?\a148\a147He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the chair. I was in such a hurry to come to you.\a148\a147You left your door open?\a148\a147I locked up the papers first.\a148\a147Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames, that unless the Indian student recognised the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there.\a148\a147So it seems to me.\a148Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.\a147Well,\a148 said he, \a147let us go round. Not one of your cases, Watson\a151 mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to. Now, Mr. Soames\a151 at your disposal!\a148The sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college. A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase. On the ground floor was the tutor\a146s room. Above were three students, one on each story. It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem. Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window. Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.\a147He must have entered through the door. There is no opening except the one pane,\a148 said our learned guide.\a147Dear me!\a148 said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion. \a147Well, if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside.\a148The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room. We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.\a147I am afraid there are no signs here,\a148 said he. \a147One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say; which chair?\a148\a147By the window there.\a148\a147I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have finished with the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of course, what has happened is very clear. The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table. He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape.\a148\a147As a matter of fact he could not,\a148 said Soames, \a147for I entered by the side door.\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s good. Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let me see the three strips. No finger impressions\a151 no. Well, he carried over this one first and he copied it. How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction. A quarter of an hour, not less. Then he tossed it down and seized the next. He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat\ivery\i hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there. You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door?\a148\a147No, I can\a146t say I was.\a148\a147Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again. This is of interest, Watson. The pencil was not an ordinary one. It was above the usual size, with a soft lead; the outer colour was dark blue, the maker\a146s name was printed in silver lettering, and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man. When I add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an additional aid.\a148Mr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information. \a147I can follow the other points,\a148 said he, \a147but really, in this matter of the length\a151\a151\a148Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear wood after them.\a147You see?\a148\a147No, I fear that even now\a151\a151\a148\a147Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others. What could this NN be. It is at the end of a word. You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker\a146s name. Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?\a148 He held the small table sideways to the electric light. \a147I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. No, I see nothing. I don\a146t think there is anything more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of. Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this is very interesting. And the cut\a151 a positive tear, I see. It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames. Where does that door lead to?\a148\a147To my bedroom.\a148\a147Have you been in it since your adventure?\a148\a147No; I came straight away for you.\a148\a147I should like to have a glance round. What a charming, old-fashioned room. Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until I have examined the floor. No, I see nothing. What about this curtain. You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I suppose?\a148As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency. As a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs. Holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor.\a147Halloa. What\a146s this?\a148 said he.It was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.\a147Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting-room, Mr. Soames.\a148\a147What could he have wanted there?\a148\a147I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected way, and so he had no warning until you were at the very door. What could he do. He caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself.\a148\a147Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?\a148\a147So I read it.\a148\a147Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don\a146t know whether you observed my bedroom window?\a148\a147Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man.\a148\a147Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and, finally, finding the door open have escaped that way.\a148Holmes shook his head impatiently.\a147Let us be practical,\a148 said he. \a147I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door?\a148\a147Yes, there are.\a148\a147And they are all in for this examination?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others?\a148Soames hesitated.\a147It is a very delicate question,\a148 said he. \a147One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs.\a148\a147Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.\a148\a147I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete; plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump. He is a fine, manly fellow. His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf. My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious. He will do well.\a147The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow, as most of those Indians are. He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is steady and methodical.\a147The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work\a151 one of the brightest intellects of the University, but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year. He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination.\a148\a147Then it is he whom you suspect?\a148\a147I dare not go so far as that. But of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely.\a148\a147Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your servant, Bannister.\a148He was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fellow of fifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life. His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.\a147We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,\a148 said his master.\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147I understand,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that you left your key in the door?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside?\a148\a147It was most unfortunate, sir. But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times.\a148\a147When did you enter the room?\a148\a147It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames\a146s tea time.\a148\a147How long did you stay?\a148\a147When I saw that he was absent I withdrew at once.\a148\a147Did you look at these papers on the table?\a148\a147No, sir; certainly not.\a148\a147How came you to leave the key in the door?\a148\a147I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back for the key. Then I forgot.\a148\a147Has the outer door a spring lock?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Then it was open all the time?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Anyone in the room could get out?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?\a148\a147Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I have been here. I nearly fainted, sir.\a148\a147So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel bad?\a148\a147Where was I, sir. Why, here, near the door.\a148\a147That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?\a148\a147I don\a146t know, sir. It didn\a146t matter to me where I sat.\a148\a147I really don\a146t think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He was looking very bad\a151 quite ghastly.\a148\a147You stayed here when your master left?\a148\a147Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to my room.\a148\a147Whom do you suspect?\a148\a147Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don\a146t believe there is any gentleman in this University who is capable of profiting by such an action. No, sir, I\a146ll not believe it.\a148\a147Thank you; that will do,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Oh, one more word. You have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss?\a148\a147No, sir; not a word.\a148\a147You haven\a146t seen any of them?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please.\a148Three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom.\a148\a147Your three birds are all in their nests,\a148 said Holmes, looking up. \a147Halloa. What\a146s that. One of them seems restless enough.\a148It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.\a147I should like to have a peep at each of them,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Is it possible?\a148\a147No difficulty in the world,\a148 Soames answered. \a147This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them. Come along, and I will personally conduct you.\a148\a147No names, please!\a148 said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist\a146s door. A tall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand. There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it on his note-book, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host, and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the Indian\a151 a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance and was obviously glad when Holmes\a146s architectural studies had come to an end. I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching. Only at the third did our visit prove abortive. The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it. \a147I don\a146t care who you are. You can go to blazes!\a148 roared the angry voice. \a147To-morrow\a146s the exam, and I won\a146t be drawn by anyone.\a148\a147A rude fellow,\a148 said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair. \a147Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious.\a148Holmes\a146s response was a curious one.\a147Can you tell me his exact height?\a148 he asked.\a147Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six would be about it.\a148\a147That is very important,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, Mr. Soames, I wish you good-night.\a148Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. \a147Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion. You don\a146t seem to realize the position. To-morrow is the examination. I must take some definite action to-night. I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced.\a148\a147You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow morning and chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile you change nothing\a151 nothing at all.\a148\a147Very good, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings. Good-bye.\a148When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The others were invisible.\a147Well, Watson, what do you think of it?\a148 Holmes asked, as we came out into the main street. \a147Quite a little parlour game\a151 sort of three-card trick, is it not. There are your three men. It must be one of them. You take your choice. Which is yours?\a148\a147The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the worst record. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. Why should he be pacing his room all the time?\a148\a147There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart.\a148\a147He looked at us in a queer way.\a148\a147So would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of value. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too, and knives\a151 all was satisfactory. But that fellow \idoes\i puzzle me.\a148\a147Who?\a148\a147Why, Bannister, the servant. What\a146s his game in the matter?\a148\a147He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.\a148\a147So he did me. That\a146s the puzzling part. Why should a perfectly honest man\a151 well, well, here\a146s a large stationer\a146s. We shall begin our researches here.\a148There were only four stationers of any consequence in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a duplicate. All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock. My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half-humorous resignation.\a147No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear fellow, it is nearly nine, and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty. What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit and that I shall share your downfall\a151 not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students.\a148Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At eight in the morning he came into my room just as I finished my toilet.\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147it is time we went down to St. Luke\a146s. Can you do without breakfast?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive.\a148\a147Have you anything positive to tell him?\a148\a147I think so.\a148\a147You have formed a conclusion?\a148\a147Yes, my dear Watson; I have solved the mystery.\a148\a147But what fresh evidence could you have got?\a148\a147Aha. It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six. I have put in two hours\a146 hard work and covered at least five miles, with something to show for it. Look at that!\a148He held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.\a147Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday!\a148\a147And one more this morning. It is a fair argument that wherever No. 3 came from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2. Eh, Watson. Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain.\a148The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers. In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.\a147Thank Heaven that you have come. I feared that you had given it up in despair. What am I to do. Shall the examination proceed?\a148\a147Yes; let it proceed by all means.\a148\a147But this rascal\a151\a151?\a148\a147He shall not compete.\a148\a147You know him?\a148\a147I think so. If this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers, and resolve ourselves into a small private court-martial. You there, if you please, Soames. Watson, you here. I\a146ll take the arm-chair in the middle. I think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast. Kindly ring the bell!\a148Bannister entered, and shrunk back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.\a147You will kindly close the door,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday\a146s incident?\a148The man turned white to the roots of his hair.\a147I have told you everything, sir.\a148\a147Nothing to add?\a148\a147Nothing at all, sir.\a148\a147Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you sat down on that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room?\a148Bannister\a146s face was ghastly.\a147No, sir; certainly not.\a148\a147It is only a suggestion,\a148 said Holmes, suavely. \a147I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough, since the moment that Mr. Soames\a146s back was turned you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom.\a148Bannister licked his dry lips.\a147There was no man, sir.\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied.\a148The man\a146s face set in sullen defiance.\a147There was no man, sir.\a148\a147Come, come, Bannister!\a148\a147No, sir; there was no one.\a148\a147In that case you can give us no further information. Would you please remain in the room. Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now, Soames, I am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young Gilchrist, and to ask him to step down into yours.\a148An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student. He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.\a147Just close the door,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us. We can be perfectly frank with each other. We want to know, Mr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday?\a148The unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.\a147No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir; I never said a word\a151 never one word!\a148 cried the servant.\a147No, but you have now,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, sir, you must see that after Bannister\a146s words your position is hopeless, and that your only chance lies in a frank confession.\a148For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features. The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table and, burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.\a147Come, come,\a148 said Holmes, kindly; \a147it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal. Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong. Shall I do so. Well, well, don\a146t trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.\a147From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind. The printer one could, of course, dismiss. He could examine the papers in his own office. The Indian I also thought nothing of. If the proofs were in a roll he could not possibly know what they were. On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table. I dismissed that. The man who entered knew that the papers were there. How did he know?\a147When I approached your room I examined the window. You amused me by supposing that I was contemplating the possibility of someone having in broad daylight, under the eyes of all these opposite rooms, forced himself through it. Such an idea was absurd. I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table. I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason to think that if one of your three students was a man of unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three.\a147I entered and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table. Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance jumper. Then the whole thing came to me in an instant, and I only needed certain corroborative proofs, which I speedily obtained.\a147What happened was this. This young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practising the jump. He returned carrying his jumping shoes, which are provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes. As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were. No harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a dangerous exploit, for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.\a147Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that he yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table. What was it you put on that chair near the window?\a148\a147Gloves,\a148 said the young man.Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. \a147He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. He thought the tutor must return by the main gate, and that he would see him. As we know, he came back by the side gate. Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape. He forgot his gloves, but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the culprit had taken refuge there. The earth round the spike had been left on the table, and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom. I may add that I walked out to the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit, and carried away a specimen of it, together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?\a148The student had drawn himself erect.\a147Yes, sir, it is true,\a148 said he.\a147Good heavens, have you nothing to add?\a148 cried Soames.\a147Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night. It was before I knew that my sin had found me out. Here it is, sir. You will see that I have said, \a145I have determined not to go in for the examination. I have been offered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to South Africa at once.\a148\a146\a147I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage,\a148 said Soames. \a147But why did you change your purpose?\a148Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.\a147There is the man who set me in the right path,\a148 said he.\a147Come now, Bannister,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It will be clear to you from what I have said that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible. Can you not clear up the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your action?\a148\a147It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known; but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know. Time was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman\a146s father. When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world. I watched his son all I could for the sake of the old days. Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was Mr. Gilchrist\a146s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them the game was up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until Mr. Soames he went for you. Then out came my poor young master, whom I had dandled on my knee, and confessed it all to me. Wasn\a146t it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn\a146t it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed. Could you blame me, sir?\a148\a147No, indeed,\a148 said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet. \a147Well, Soames, I think we have cleared your little problem up, and our breakfast awaits us at home. Come, Watson. As to you, sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia. For once you have fallen low. Let us see in the future how high you can rise.\a148\p\X1\BThe Golden Pince-Nez\B\X1\c\i\m="gold-06.png"\i\cWhen I look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year 1894 I confess that it is very difficult for me, out of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. As I turn over the pages I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby the banker. Here also I find an account of the Addleton tragedy and the singular contents of the ancient British barrow. The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of Huret, the Boulevard assassin\a151 an exploit which won for Holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion of Honour. Each of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them unite so many singular points of interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime.It was a wild, tempestuous night towards the close of November. Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Outside the wind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. It was strange there in the very depths of the town, with ten miles of man\a146s handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of Nature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London was no more than the molehills that dot the fields. I walked to the window and looked out on the deserted street. The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement. A single cab was splashing its way from the Oxford Street end.\a147Well, Watson, it\a146s as well we have not to turn out to-night,\a148 said Holmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest. \a147I\a146ve done enough for one sitting. It is trying work for the eyes. So far as I can make out it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey\a146s accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century. Halloa! halloa! halloa. What\a146s this?\a148Amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse\a146s hoofs and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the kerb. The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door.\a147What can he want?\a148 I ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it.\a147Want. He wants us. And we, my poor Watson, want overcoats and cravats and goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather. Wait a bit, though. There\a146s the cab off again. There\a146s hope yet. He\a146d have kept it if he had wanted us to come. Run down, my dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.\a148When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor I had no difficulty in recognising him. It was young Stanley Hopkins, a promising detective, in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very practical interest.\a147Is he in?\a148 he asked, eagerly.\a147Come up, my dear sir,\a148 said Holmes\a146s voice from above. \a147I hope you have no designs upon us on such a night as this.\a148The detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof. I helped him out of it while Holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate.\a147Now, my dear Hopkins, draw up and warm your toes,\a148 said he. \a147Here\a146s a cigar, and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon which is good medicine on a night like this. It must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale.\a148\a147It is indeed, Mr. Holmes. I\a146ve had a bustling afternoon, I promise you. Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions?\a148\a147I\a146ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day.\a148\a147Well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong at that, so you have not missed anything. I haven\a146t let the grass grow under my feet. It\a146s down in Kent, seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line. I was wired for at three-fifteen, reached Yoxley Old Place at five, conducted my investigation, was back at Charing Cross by the last train, and straight to you by cab.\a148\a147Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?\a148\a147It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I can see it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn\a146t go wrong. There\a146s no motive, Mr. Holmes. That\a146s what bothers me\a151 I can\a146t put my hand on a motive. Here\a146s a man dead\a151 there\a146s no denying that\a151 but, so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.\a148Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.\a147Let us hear about it,\a148 said he.\a147I\a146ve got my facts pretty clear,\a148 said Stanley Hopkins. \a147All I want now is to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out, is like this. Some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was taken by an elderly man, who gave the name of Professor Coram. He was an invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath-chair. He was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man. His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Marker, and of a maid, Susan Tarlton. These have both been with him since his arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent character. The Professor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary about a year ago to engage a secretary. The first two that he tried were not successes; but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith, a very young man straight from the University, seems to have been just what his employer wanted. His work consisted in writing all the morning to the Professor\a146s dictation, and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day\a146s work. This Willoughby Smith has nothing against him either as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at Cambridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a decent, quiet, hardworking fellow, with no weak spot in him at all. And yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the Professor\a146s study under circumstances which can point only to murder.\a148The wind howled and screamed at the windows. Holmes and I drew closer to the fire while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative.\a147If you were to search all England,\a148 said he, \a147I don\a146t suppose you could find a household more self-contained or free from outside influences. Whole weeks would pass and not one of them go past the garden gate. The Professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else. Young Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood, and lived very much as his employer did. The two women had nothing to take them from the house. Mortimer the gardener, who wheels the bath-chair, is an Army pensioner\a151 an old Crimean man of excellent character. He does not live in the house, but in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the garden. Those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of Yoxley Old Place. At the same time, the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main London to Chatham road. It opens with a latch, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in.\a147Now I will give you the evidence of Susan Tarlton, who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter. It was in the forenoon, between eleven and twelve. She was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom. Professor Coram was still in bed, for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday. The housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house. Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which he uses as a sitting-room; but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her. She did not see him, but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick, firm tread. She did not hear the study door close, but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below. It was a wild, hoarse scream, so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a man or a woman. At the same instant there was a heavy thud, which shook the old house, and then all was silence. The maid stood petrified for a moment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. The study door was shut, and she opened it. Inside young Mr. Willoughby Smith was stretched upon the floor. At first she could see no injury, but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of his neck. It was pierced by a very small but very deep wound, which had divided the carotid artery. The instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one of those small sealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing-tables, with an ivory handle and a stiff blade. It was part of the fittings of the Professor\a146s own desk.\a147At first the maid thought that young Smith was already dead, but on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened his eyes for an instant. \a145The Professor,\a146 he murmured\a151\a145it was she.\a146 The maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words. He tried desperately to say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air. Then he fell back dead.\a147In the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene, but she was just too late to catch the young man\a146s dying words. Leaving Susan with the body, she hurried to the Professor\a146s room. He was sitting up in bed horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred. Mrs. Marker is prepared to swear that the Professor was still in his night-clothes, and, indeed, it was impossible for him to dress without the help of Mortimer, whose orders were to come at twelve o\a146clock. The Professor declares that he heard the distant cry, but that he knows nothing more. He can give no explanation of the young man\a146s last words, \a145The Professor\a151 it was she,\a146 but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium. He believes that Willoughby Smith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the crime. His first action was to send Mortimer the gardener for the local police. A little later the chief constable sent for me. Nothing was moved before I got there, and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house. It was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. There was really nothing wanting.\a148\a147Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said my companion, with a somewhat bitter smile. \a147Well, let us hear about it. What sort of job did you make of it?\a148\a147I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which will give you a general idea of the position of the Professor\a146s study and the various points of the case. It will help you in following my investigation.\a148He unfolded the rough chart, which I here reproduce, and he laid it across Holmes\a146s knee. I rose, and, standing behind Holmes, I studied it over his shoulder.\c\i\m="gold-i.png"\i\c\a147It is very rough, of course, and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential. All the rest you will see later for yourself. Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did he or she come in? Undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door, from which there is direct access to the study. Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated. The escape must have also been made along that line, for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by Susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the Professor\a146s bedroom. I therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path, which was saturated with recent rain and would certainly show any footmarks.\a147My examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. No footmarks were to be found on the path. There could be no question, however, that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path, and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track. I could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden down and someone had undoubtedly passed. It could only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning and the rain had only begun during the night.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Where does this path lead to?\a148\a147To the road.\a148\a147How long is it?\a148\a147A hundred yards or so.\a148\a147At the point where the path passes through the gate you could surely pick up the tracks?\a148\a147Unfortunately, the path was tiled at that point.\a148\a147Well, on the road itself?\a148\a147No; it was all trodden into mire.\a148\a147Tut-tut. Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or going?\a148\a147It was impossible to say. There was never any outline.\a148\a147A large foot or a small?\a148\a147You could not distinguish.\a148Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience.\a147It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since,\a148 said he. \a147It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well, it can\a146t be helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?\a148\a147I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes. I knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without. I next examined the corridor. It is lined with coconut matting and had taken no impression of any kind. This brought me into the study itself. It is a scantily-furnished room. The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed bureau. This bureau consists of a double column of drawers with a central small cupboard between them. The drawers were open, the cupboard locked. The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value was kept in them. There were some papers of importance in the cupboard, but there were no signs that this had been tampered with, and the Professor assures me that nothing was missing. It is certain that no robbery has been committed.\a147I come now to the body of the young man. It was found near the bureau, and just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. The stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forwards, so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self-inflicted.\a148\a147Unless he fell upon the knife,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Exactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we found the knife some feet away from the body, so that seems impossible. Then, of course, there are the man\a146s own dying words. And, finally, there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man\a146s right hand.\a148From his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small paper packet. He unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it. \a147Willoughby Smith had excellent sight,\a148 he added. \a147There can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin.\a148Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand and examined them with the utmost attention and interest. He held them on his nose, endeavoured to read through them, went to the window and stared up the street with them, looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins.\a147That\a146s the best I can do for you,\a148 said he. \a147It may prove to be of some use.\a148The astonished detective read the note aloud. It ran as follows:\a151\a147Wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. She has a remarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side of it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her.\a148Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been reflected upon my features.\a147Surely my deductions are simplicity itself,\a148 said he. \a147It would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as these. That they belong to a woman I infer from their delicacy, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying man. As to her being a person of refinement and well dressed, they are, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects. You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose, showing that the lady\a146s nose was very broad at the base. This sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there are a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description. My own face is a narrow one, and yet I find that I cannot get my eyes into the centre, or near the centre, of these glasses. Therefore the lady\a146s eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose. You will perceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the shoulders.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 I said, \a147I can follow each of your arguments. I confess, however, that I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician.\a148Holmes took the glasses in his hand.\a147You will perceive,\a148 he said, \a147that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. One of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new. Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months. They exactly correspond, so I gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second.\a148\a147By George, it\a146s marvellous!\a148 cried Hopkins, in an ecstasy of admiration. \a147To think that I had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it. I had intended, however, to go the round of the London opticians.\a148\a147Of course you would. Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about the case?\a148\a147Nothing, Mr. Holmes. I think that you know as much as I do now\a151 probably more. We have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station. We have heard of none. What beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. Not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest.\a148\a147Ah! there I am not in a position to help you. But I suppose you want us to come out to-morrow?\a148\a147If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes. There\a146s a train from Charing Cross to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine.\a148\a147Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly some features of great interest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. Well, it\a146s nearly one, and we had best get a few hours\a146 sleep. I dare say you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire. I\a146ll light my spirit-lamp and give you a cup of coffee before we start.\a148The gale had blown itself out next day, but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river, which I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander in the earlier days of our career. After a long and weary journey we alighted at a small station some miles from Chatham. While a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn we snatched a hurried breakfast, and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley Old Place. A constable met us at the garden gate.\a147Well, Wilson, any news?\a148\a147No, sir, nothing.\a148\a147No reports of any stranger seen?\a148\a147No, sir. Down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday.\a148\a147Have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?\a148\a147Yes, sir; there is no one that we cannot account for.\a148\a147Well, it\a146s only a reasonable walk to Chatham. Anyone might stay there, or take a train without being observed. This is the garden path of which I spoke, Mr. Holmes. I\a146ll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday.\a148\a147On which side were the marks on the grass?\a148\a147This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower-bed. I can\a146t see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.\a148\a147Yes, yes; someone has passed along,\a148 said Holmes, stooping over the grass border. \a147Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?\a148\a147Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.\a148I saw an intent look pass over Holmes\a146s face.\a147You say that she must have come back this way?\a148\a147Yes, sir; there is no other.\a148\a147On this strip of grass?\a148\a147Certainly, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Hum. It was a very remarkable performance\a151 very remarkable. Well, I think we have exhausted the path. Let us go farther. This garden door is usually kept open, I suppose. Then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in. The idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to pick this knife off the writing-table. She advanced along this corridor, leaving no traces upon the coconut matting. Then she found herself in this study. How long was she there. We have no means of judging.\a148\a147Not more than a few minutes, sir. I forgot to tell you that Mrs. Marker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very long before\a151 about a quarter of an hour, she says.\a148\a147Well, that gives us a limit. Our lady enters this room and what does she do. She goes over to the writing-table. What for. Not for anything in the drawers. If there had been anything worth her taking it would surely have been locked up. No; it was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it. Just hold a match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?\a148The mark which he was examining began upon the brass work on the right-hand side of the keyhole, and extended for about four inches, where it had scratched the varnish from the surface.\a147I noticed it, Mr. Holmes. But you\a146ll always find scratches round a keyhole.\a148\a147This is recent, quite recent. See how the brass shines where it is cut. An old scratch would be the same colour as the surface. Look at it through my lens. There\a146s the varnish, too, like earth on each side of a furrow. Is Mrs. Marker there?\a148A sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room.\a147Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Did you notice this scratch?\a148\a147No, sir, I did not.\a148\a147I am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish. Who has the key of this bureau?\a148\a147The Professor keeps it on his watch-chain.\a148\a147Is it a simple key?\a148\a147No, sir; it is a Chubb\a146s key.\a148\a147Very good. Mrs. Marker, you can go. Now we are making a little progress. Our lady enters the room, advances to the bureau, and either opens it or tries to do so. While she is thus engaged young Willoughby Smith enters the room. In her hurry to withdraw the key she makes this scratch upon the door. He seizes her, and she, snatching up the nearest object, which happens to be this knife, strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold. The blow is a fatal one. He falls and she escapes, either with or without the object for which she has come. Is Susan the maid there? Could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry, Susan?\a148\a147No sir; it is impossible. Before I got down the stair I\a146d have seen anyone in the passage. Besides, the door never opened, for I would have heard it.\a148\a147That settles this exit. Then no doubt the lady went out the way she came. I understand that this other passage leads only to the Professor\a146s room. There is no exit that way?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147We shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the Professor. Halloa, Hopkins! this is very important, very important indeed. The Professor\a146s corridor is also lined with coconut matting.\a148\a147Well, sir, what of that?\a148\a147Don\a146t you see any bearing upon the case. Well, well, I don\a146t insist upon it. No doubt I am wrong. And yet it seems to me to be suggestive. Come with me and introduce me.\a148We passed down the passage, which was of the same length as that which led to the garden. At the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door. Our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the Professor\a146s bedroom.It was a very large chamber, lined with innumerable volumes, which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were stacked all round at the base of the cases. The bed was in the centre of the room, and in it, propped up with pillows, was the owner of the house. I have seldom seen a more remarkable-looking person. It was a gaunt, aquiline face which was turned towards us, with piercing dark eyes, which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows. His hair and beard were white, save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth. A cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair, and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco-smoke. As he held out his hand to Holmes I perceived that it also was stained yellow with nicotine.\a147A smoker, Mr. Holmes?\a148 said he, speaking well-chosen English with a curious little mincing accent. \a147Pray take a cigarette. And you, sir. I can recommend them, for I have them especially prepared by Ionides of Alexandria. He sends me a thousand at a time, and I grieve to say that I have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. Bad, sir, very bad, but an old man has few pleasures. Tobacco and my work\a151 that is all that is left to me.\a148Holmes had lit a cigarette, and was shooting little darting glances all over the room.\a147Tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,\a148 the old man exclaimed. \a147Alas! what a fatal interruption. Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe. So estimable a young man. I assure you that after a few months\a146 training he was an admirable assistant. What do you think of the matter, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I have not yet made up my mind.\a148\a147I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us. To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralyzing. I seem to have lost the faculty of thought. But you are a man of action\a151 you are a man of affairs. It is part of the everyday routine of your life. You can preserve your balance in every emergency. We are fortunate indeed in having you at our side.\a148Holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old Professor was talking. I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity. It was evident that he shared our host\a146s liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.\a147Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,\a148 said the old man. \a147That is my \imagnum opus\i\a151 the pile of papers on the side table yonder. It is my analysis of the documents found in the Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work which will cut deep at the very foundations of revealed religion. With my enfeebled health I do not know whether I shall ever be able to complete it now that my assistant has been taken from me. Dear me. Mr. Holmes; why, you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself.\a148Holmes smiled.\a147I am a connoisseur,\a148 said he, taking another cigarette from the box\a151 his fourth\a151 and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished. \a147I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination, Professor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it. I would only ask this. What do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words. \a145The Professor\a151 it was she\a146?\a148The Professor shook his head.\a147Susan is a country girl,\a148 said he, \a147and you know the incredible stupidity of that class. I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into this meaningless message.\a148\a147I see. You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?\a148\a147Possibly an accident; possibly\a151 I only breathe it among ourselves\a151 a suicide. Young men have their hidden troubles\a151 some affair of the heart, perhaps, which we have never known. It is a more probable supposition than murder.\a148\a147But the eye-glasses?\a148\a147Ah. I am only a student\a151 a man of dreams. I cannot explain the practical things of life. But still, we are aware, my friend, that love-gages may take strange shapes. By all means take another cigarette. It is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. A fan, a glove, glasses\a151 who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life. This gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass; but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point. As to the knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell. It is possible that I speak as a child, but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith has met his fate by his own hand.\a148Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued to walk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming cigarette after cigarette.\a147Tell me, Professor Coram,\a148 he said, at last, \a147what is in that cupboard in the bureau?\a148\a147Nothing that would help a thief. Family papers, letters from my poor wife, diplomas of Universities which have done me honour. Here is the key. You can look for yourself.\a148Holmes picked up the key and looked at it for an instant; then he handed it back.\a147No; I hardly think that it would help me,\a148 said he. \a147I should prefer to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in my head. There is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward. We must apologize for having intruded upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise that we won\a146t disturb you until after lunch. At two o\a146clock we will come again and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval.\a148Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence.\a147Have you a clue?\a148 I asked, at last.\a147It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked,\a148 said he. \a147It is possible that I am utterly mistaken. The cigarettes will show me.\a148\a147My dear Holmes,\a148 I exclaimed, \a147how on earth\a151\a151\a148\a147Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not, there\a146s no harm done. Of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but I take a short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker. Let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.\a148I may have remarked before that Holmes had, when he liked, a peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them. In half the time which he had named he had captured the housekeeper\a146s goodwill, and was chatting with her as if he had known her for years.\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes, it is as you say, sir. He does smoke something terrible. All day and sometimes all night, sir. I\a146ve seen that room of a morning\a151 well, sir, you\a146d have thought it was a London fog. Poor young Mr. Smith, he was a smoker also, but not as bad as the Professor. His health\a151 well, I don\a146t know that it\a146s better nor worse for the smoking.\a148\a147Ah!\a148 said Holmes, \a147but it kills the appetite.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t know about that, sir.\a148\a147I suppose the Professor eats hardly anything?\a148\a147Well, he is variable. I\a146ll say that for him.\a148\a147I\a146ll wager he took no breakfast this morning, and won\a146t face his lunch after all the cigarettes I saw him consume.\a148\a147Well, you\a146re out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning. I don\a146t know when I\a146ve known him make a better one, and he\a146s ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. I\a146m surprised myself, for since I came into that room yesterday and saw young Mr. Smith lying there on the floor I couldn\a146t bear to look at food. Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the Professor hasn\a146t let it take his appetite away.\a148We loitered the morning away in the garden. Stanley Hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the Chatham Road the previous morning. As to my friend, all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. I had never known him handle a case in such a half-hearted fashion. Even the news brought back by Hopkins that he had found the children and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with Holmes\a146s description, and wearing either spectacles or eye-glasses, failed to rouse any sign of keen interest. He was more attentive when Susan, who waited upon us at lunch, volunteered the information that she believed Mr. Smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred. I could not myself see the bearing of this incident, but I clearly perceived that Holmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain. Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch. \a147Two o\a146clock, gentlemen,\a148 said he. \a147We must go up and have it out with our friend the Professor.\a148The old man had just finished his lunch, and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had credited him. He was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us. The eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth. He had been dressed and was seated in an arm-chair by the fire.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?\a148 He shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion. Holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment, and between them they tipped the box over the edge. For a minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places. When we rose again I observed that Holmes\a146s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour. Only at a crisis have I seen those battle-signals flying.\a147Yes,\a148 said he, \a147I have solved it.\a148Stanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement. Something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt features of the old Professor.\a147Indeed. In the garden?\a148\a147No, here.\a148\a147Here. When?\a148\a147This instant.\a148\a147You are surely joking, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion.\a148\a147I have forged and tested every link of my chain, Professor Coram, and I am sure that it is sound. What your motives are or what exact part you play in this strange business I am not yet able to say. In a few minutes I shall probably hear it from your own lips. Meanwhile I will reconstruct what is past for your benefit, so that you may know the information which I still require.\a147A lady yesterday entered your study. She came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. She had a key of her own. I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and I do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced. You were not an accessory, therefore, and she came, so far as I can read the evidence, without your knowledge to rob you.\a148The Professor blew a cloud from his lips. \a147This is most interesting and instructive,\a148 said he. \a147Have you no more to add? Surely, having traced this lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.\a148\a147I will endeavour to do so. In the first place she was seized by your secretary, and stabbed him in order to escape. This catastrophe I am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident, for I am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury. An assassin does not come unarmed. Horrified by what she had done she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy. Unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in the scuffle, and as she was extremely short-sighted she was really helpless without them. She ran down a corridor, which she imagined to be that by which she had come\a151 both were lined with coconut matting\a151 and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage and that her retreat was cut off behind her. What was she to do. She could not go back. She could not remain where she was. She must go on. She went on. She mounted a stair, pushed open a door, and found herself in your room.\a148The old man sat with his mouth open staring wildly at Holmes. Amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features. Now, with an effort, he shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter.\a147All very fine, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147But there is one little flaw in your splendid theory. I was myself in my room, and I never left it during the day.\a148\a147I am aware of that, Professor Coram.\a148\a147And you mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room?\a148\a147I never said so. You \iwere\i aware of it. You spoke with her. You recognised her. You aided her to escape.\a148Again the Professor burst into high-keyed laughter. He had risen to his feet and his eyes glowed like embers.\a147You are mad!\a148 he cried. \a147You are talking insanely. I helped her to escape. Where is she now?\a148\a147She is there,\a148 said Holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room.I saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face, and he fell back in his chair. At the same instant the bookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman rushed out into the room. \a147You are right!\a148 she cried, in a strange foreign voice. \a147You are right. I am here.\a148She was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come from the walls of her hiding-place. Her face, too, was streaked with grime, and at the best she could never have been handsome, for she had the exact physical characteristics which Holmes had divined, with, in addition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her natural blindness, and what with the change from dark to light, she stood as one dazed, blinking about her to see where and who we were. And yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman\a146s bearing, a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which compelled something of respect and admiration. Stanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his prisoner, but she waved him aside gently, and yet with an overmastering dignity which compelled obedience. The old man lay back in his chair, with a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes.\a147Yes, sir, I am your prisoner,\a148 she said. \a147From where I stood I could hear everything, and I know that you have learned the truth. I confess it all. It was I who killed the young man. But you are right, you who say it was an accident. I did not even know that it was a knife which I held in my hand, for in my despair I snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go. It is the truth that I tell.\a148\a147Madam,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I am sure that it is the truth. I fear that you are far from well.\a148She had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark dust-streaks upon her face. She seated herself on the side of the bed; then she resumed.\a147I have only a little time here,\a148 she said, \a147but I would have you to know the whole truth. I am this man\a146s wife. He is not an Englishman. He is a Russian. His name I will not tell.\a148For the first time the old man stirred. \a147God bless you, Anna!\a148 he cried. \a147God bless you!\a148She cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction. \a147Why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours, Sergius?\a148 said she. \a147It has done harm to many and good to none\a151 not even to yourself. However, it is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before God\a146s time. I have enough already upon my soul since I crossed the threshold of this cursed house. But I must speak or I shall be too late.\a147I have said, gentlemen, that I am this man\a146s wife. He was fifty and I a foolish girl of twenty when we married. It was in a city of Russia, a University\a151 I will not name the place.\a148\a147God bless you, Anna!\a148 murmured the old man again.\a147We were reformersrevolutionistsNihilists, you understand. He and I and many more. Then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was killed, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his confession. Some of us found our way to the gallows and some to Siberia. I was among these last, but my term was not for life. My husband came to England with his ill-gotten gains, and has lived in quiet ever since, knowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done.\a148The old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette. \a147I am in your hands, Anna,\a148 said he. \a147You were always good to me.\a148\a147I have not yet told you the height of his villainy,\a148 said she. \a147Among our comrades of the Order there was one who was the friend of my heart. He was noble, unselfish, loving\a151 all that my husband was not. He hated violence. We were all guilty\a151 if that is guilt\a151 but he was not. He wrote for ever dissuading us from such a course. These letters would have saved him. So would my diary, in which from day to day I had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken. My husband found and kept both diary and letters. He hid them, and he tried hard to swear away the young man\a146s life. In this he failed, but Alexis was sent a convict to Siberia, where now, at this moment, he works in a salt mine. Think of that, you villain, you villain; now, now, at this very moment, Alexis, a man whose name you are not worthy to speak, works and lives like a slave, and yet I have your life in my hands and I let you go.\a148\a147You were always a noble woman, Anna,\a148 said the old man, puffing at his cigarette.She had risen, but she fell back again with a little cry of pain.\a147I must finish,\a148 she said. \a147When my term was over I set myself to get the diary and letters which, if sent to the Russian Government, would procure my friend\a146s release. I knew that my husband had come to England. After months of searching I discovered where he was. I knew that he still had the diary, for when I was in Siberia I had a letter from him once reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages. Yet I was sure that with his revengeful nature he would never give it to me of his own free will. I must get it for myself. With this object I engaged an agent from a private detective firm, who entered my husband\a146s house as secretary\a151 it was your second secretary, Sergius, the one who left you so hurriedly. He found that papers were kept in the cupboard, and he got an impression of the key. He would not go farther. He furnished me with a plan of the house, and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty, as the secretary was employed up here. So at last I took my courage in both hands and I came down to get the papers for myself. I succeeded, but at what a cost!\a147I had just taken the papers and was locking the cupboard when the young man seized me. I had seen him already that morning. He had met me in the road and I had asked him to tell me where Professor Coram lived, not knowing that he was in his employ.\a148\a147Exactly! exactly!\a148 said Holmes. \a147The secretary came back and told his employer of the woman he had met. Then in his last breath he tried to send a message that it was she\a151 the she whom he had just discussed with him.\a148\a147You must let me speak,\a148 said the woman, in an imperative voice, and her face contracted as if in pain. \a147When he had fallen I rushed from the room, chose the wrong door, and found myself in my husband\a146s room. He spoke of giving me up. I showed him that if he did so his life was in my hands. If he gave me to the law I could give him to the Brotherhood. It was not that I wished to live for my own sake, but it was that I desired to accomplish my purpose. He knew that I would do what I said\a151 that his own fate was involved in mine. For that reason and for no other he shielded me. He thrust me into that dark hiding-place, a relic of old days, known only to himself. He took his meals in his own room, and so was able to give me part of his food. It was agreed that when the police left the house I should slip away by night and come back no more. But in some way you have read our plans\a148. She tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet. \a147These are my last words,\a148 said she; \a147here is the packet which will save Alexis. I confide it to your honour and to your love of justice. Take it. You will deliver it at the Russian Embassy. Now I have done my duty, and\a151\a151\a148\a147Stop her!\a148 cried Holmes. He had bounded across the room and had wrenched a small phial from her hand.\a147Too late!\a148 she said, sinking back on the bed. \a147Too late. I took the poison before I left my hiding-place. My head swims. I am going. I charge you, sir, to remember the packet.\a148\a147A simple case, and yet in some ways an instructive one,\a148 Holmes remarked, as we travelled back to town. \a147It hinged from the outset upon the pince-nez. But for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these I am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution. It was clear to me from the strength of the glasses that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them. When you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step I remarked, as you may remember, that it was a noteworthy performance. In my mind I set it down as an impossible performance, save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses. I was forced, therefore, to seriously consider the hypothesis that she had remained within the house. On perceiving the similarity of the two corridors it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake, and in that case it was evident that she must have entered the Professor\a146s room. I was keenly on the alert, therefore, for whatever would bear out this supposition, and I examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding-place. The carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed, so I dismissed the idea of a trap-door. There might well be a recess behind the books. As you are aware, such devices are common in old libraries. I observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points, but that one bookcase was left clear. This, then, might be the door. I could see no marks to guide me, but the carpet was of a dun colour, which lends itself very well to examination. I therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes, and I dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase. It was a simple trick, but exceedingly effective. I then went downstairs and I ascertained, in your presence, Watson, without your perceiving the drift of my remarks, that Professor Coram\a146s consumption of food had increased\a151 as one would expect when he is supplying a second person. We then ascended to the room again, when, by upsetting the cigarette-box, I obtained a very excellent view of the floor, and was able to see quite clearly, from the traces upon the cigarette ash, that the prisoner had, in our absence, come out from her retreat. Well, Hopkins, here we are at Charing Cross, and I congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion. You are going to head-quarters, no doubt. I think, Watson, you and I will drive together to the Russian Embassy.\a148\p\X1\BThe Missing Three-Quarter\B\X1\c\i\m="miss-03.png"\i\cWe were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker Street, but I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy February morning some seven or eight years ago and gave Mr. Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. It was addressed to him, and ran thus:\a151\a147Please await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter missing; indispensable to-morrow.OVERTON.\a148\a147Strand post-mark and dispatched ten-thirty-six,\a148 said Holmes, reading it over and over. \a147Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence. Well, well, he will be here, I dare say, by the time I have looked through \iThe Times\i, and then we shall know all about it. Even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days.\a148Things had indeed been very slow with us, and I had learned to dread such periods of inaction, for I knew by experience that my companion\a146s brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work. For years I had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career. Now I knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer craved for this artificial stimulus, but I was well aware that the fiend was not dead, but sleeping; and I have known that the sleep was a light one and the waking near when in periods of idleness I have seen the drawn look upon Holmes\a146s ascetic face, and the brooding of his deep-set and inscrutable eyes. Therefore I blessed this Mr. Overton, whoever he might be, since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his tempestuous life.As we had expected, the telegram was soon followed by its sender, and the card of Mr. Cyril Overton, of Trinity College, Cambridge, announced the arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone of solid bone and muscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad shoulders and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with anxiety.\a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148My companion bowed.\a147I\a146ve been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector Stanley Hopkins. He advised me to come to you. He said the case, so far as he could see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police.\a148\a147Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.\a148\a147It\a146s awful, Mr. Holmes, simply awful. I wonder my hair isn\a146t grey. Godfrey Staunton\a151 you\a146ve heard of him, of course? He\a146s simply the hinge that the whole team turns on. I\a146d rather spare two from the pack and have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. Whether it\a146s passing, or tackling, or dribbling, there\a146s no one to touch him; and then, he\a146s got the head and can hold us all together. What am I to do. That\a146s what I ask you, Mr. Holmes. There\a146s Moorhouse, first reserve, but he is trained as a half, and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch-line. He\a146s a fine place-kick, it\a146s true, but, then, he has no judgment, and he can\a146t sprint for nuts. Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford fliers, could romp round him. Stevenson is fast enough, but he couldn\a146t drop from the twenty-five line, and a three-quarter who can\a146t either punt or drop isn\a146t worth a place for pace alone. No, Mr. Holmes, we are done unless you can help me to find Godfrey Staunton.\a148My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech, which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon the speaker\a146s knee. When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out his hand and took down letter \a147S\a148 of his commonplace book. For once he dug in vain into that mine of varied information.\a147There is Arthur H. Staunton, the rising young forger,\a148 said he, \a147and there was Henry Staunton, whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton is a new name to me.\a148It was our visitor\a146s turn to look surprised.\a147Why, Mr. Holmes, I thought you knew things,\a148 said he. \a147I suppose, then, if you have never heard of Godfrey Staunton you don\a146t know Cyril Overton either?\a148Holmes shook his head good-humouredly.\a147Great Scot!\a148 cried the athlete. \a147Why, I was first reserve for England against Wales, and I\a146ve skippered the \a145Varsity all this year. But that\a146s nothing. I didn\a146t think there was a soul in England who didn\a146t know Godfrey Staunton, the crack three-quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and five Internationals. Good Lord. Mr. Holmes, where \ihave\i you lived?\a148Holmes laughed at the young giant\a146s na\a239ve astonishment.\a147You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton, a sweeter and healthier one. My ramifications stretch out into many sections of society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the best and soundest thing in England. However, your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do; so now, my good sir, I beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and quietly exactly what it is that has occurred, and how you desire that I should help you.\a148Young Overton\a146s face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more accustomed to using his muscles than his wits; but by degrees, with many repetitions and obscurities which I may omit from his narrative, he laid his strange story before us.\a147It\a146s this way, Mr. Holmes. As I have said, I am the skipper of the Rugger team of Cambridge \a145Varsity, and Godfrey Staunton is my best man. To-morrow we play Oxford. Yesterday we all came up and we settled at Bentley\a146s private hotel. At ten o\a146clock I went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost, for I believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. I had a word or two with Godfrey before he turned in. He seemed to me to be pale and bothered. I asked him what was the matter. He said he was all right\a151 just a touch of headache. I bade him good-night and left him. Half an hour later the porter tells me that a rough-looking man with a beard called with a note for Godfrey. He had not gone to bed and the note was taken to his room. Godfrey read it and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-axed. The porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me, but Godfrey stopped him, had a drink of water, and pulled himself together. Then he went downstairs, said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall, and the two of them went off together. The last that the porter saw of them, they were almost running down the street in the direction of the Strand. This morning Godfrey\a146s room was empty, his bed had never been slept in, and his things were all just as I had seen them the night before. He had gone off at a moment\a146s notice with this stranger, and no word has come from him since. I don\a146t believe he will ever come back. He was a sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his marrow, and he wouldn\a146t have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him. No; I feel as if he were gone for good and we should never see him again.\a148Sherlock Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular narrative.\a147What did you do?\a148 he asked.\a147I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there. I have had an answer. No one has seen him.\a148\a147Could he have got back to Cambridge?\a148\a147Yes, there is a late train\a151 quarter-past eleven.\a148\a147But so far as you can ascertain he did not take it?\a148\a147No, he has not been seen.\a148\a147What did you do next?\a148\a147I wired to Lord Mount-James.\a148\a147Why to Lord Mount-James?\a148\a147Godfrey is an orphan, and Lord Mount-James is his nearest relative\a151 his uncle, I believe.\a148\a147Indeed. This throws new light upon the matter. Lord Mount-James is one of the richest men in England.\a148\a147So I\a146ve heard Godfrey say.\a148\a147And your friend was closely related?\a148\a147Yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly eighty\a151 cram full of gout, too. They say he could chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles. He never allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an absolute miser, but it will all come to him right enough.\a148\a147Have you heard from Lord Mount-James?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147What motive could your friend have in going to Lord Mount-James?\a148\a147Well, something was worrying him the night before, and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative who had so much of it, though from all I have heard he would not have much chance of getting it. Godfrey was not fond of the old man. He would not go if he could help it.\a148\a147Well, we can soon determine that. If your friend was going to his relative, Lord Mount-James, you have then to explain the visit of this rough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the agitation that was caused by his coming.\a148Cyril Overton pressed his hands to his head. \a147I can make nothing of it,\a148 said he.\a147Well, well, I have a clear day, and I shall be happy to look into the matter,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman. It must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is likely to hold him away. Let us step round together to this hotel, and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter.\a148Sherlock Holmes was a past-master in the art of putting a humble witness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of Godfrey Staunton\a146s abandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter had to tell. The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither was he a working man. He was simply what the porter described as a \a147medium-looking chap\a148; a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed. He seemed himself to be agitated. The porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note. Godfrey Staunton had crammed the note into his pocket. Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall. They had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had only distinguished the one word \a147time\a148. Then they had hurried off in the manner described. It was just half-past ten by the hall clock.\a147Let me see,\a148 said Holmes, seating himself on Staunton\a146s bed. \a147You are the day porter, are you not?\a148\a147Yes, sir; I go off duty at eleven.\a148\a147The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?\a148\a147No, sir; one theatre party came in late. No one else.\a148\a147Were you on duty all day yesterday?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Did you take any messages to Mr. Staunton?\a148\a147Yes, sir; one telegram.\a148\a147Ah! that\a146s interesting. What o\a146clock was this?\a148\a147About six.\a148\a147Where was Mr. Staunton when he received it?\a148\a147Here in his room.\a148\a147Were you present when he opened it?\a148\a147Yes, sir; I waited to see if there was an answer.\a148\a147Well, was there?\a148\a147Yes, sir. He wrote an answer.\a148\a147Did you take it?\a148\a147No; he took it himself.\a148\a147But he wrote it in your presence?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I was standing by the door, and he with his back turned at that table. When he had written it he said, \a145All right, porter, I will take this myself.\a146\a160\a148\a147What did he write it with?\a148\a147A pen, sir.\a148\a147Was the telegraphic form one of these on the table?\a148\a147Yes, sir; it was the top one.\a148Holmes rose. Taking the forms he carried them over to the window and carefully examined that which was uppermost.\a147It is a pity he did not write in pencil,\a148 said he, throwing them down again with a shrug of disappointment. \a147As you have no doubt frequently observed, Watson, the impression usually goes through\a151 a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage. However, I can find no trace here. I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this blotting-pad. Ah, yes, surely this is the very thing!\a148He tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and turned towards us the following hieroglyphic:\a151\c\i\m="miss-1i.png"\i\cCyril Overton was much excited. \a147Hold it to the glass!\a148 he cried.\a147That is unnecessary,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The paper is thin, and the reverse will give the message. Here it is\a148. He turned it over and we read:\a151\c\i\m="miss-2i.png"\i\c\a147So that is the tail end of the telegram which Godfrey Staunton dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance. There are at least six words of the message which have escaped us; but what remains\a151\a145Stand by us for God\a146s sake!\a146proves that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him, and from which someone else could protect him. \a145\iUs\i\a146, mark you. Another person was involved. Who should it be but the pale-faced, bearded man, who seemed himself in so nervous a state. What, then, is the connection between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded man. And what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger. Our inquiry has already narrowed down to that.\a148\a147We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed,\a148 I suggested.\a147Exactly, my dear Watson. Your reflection, though profound, had already crossed my mind. But I dare say it may have come to your notice that if you walk into a post-office and demand to see the counterfoil of another man\a146s message there may be some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you. There is so much red tape in these matters. However, I have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained. Meanwhile, I should like in your presence, Mr. Overton, to go through these papers which have been left upon the table.\a148There were a number of letters, bills, and note-books, which Holmes turned over and examined with quick, nervous fingers and darting, penetrating eyes. \a147Nothing here,\a148 he said, at last. \a147By the way, I suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow\a151 nothing amiss with him?\a148\a147Sound as a bell.\a148\a147Have you ever known him ill?\a148\a147Not a day. He has been laid up with a hack, and once he slipped his knee-cap, but that was nothing.\a148\a147Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose. I should think he may have had some secret trouble. With your assent I will put one or two of these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear upon our future inquiry.\a148\a147One moment! one moment!\a148 cried a querulous voice, and we looked up to find a queer little old man, jerking and twitching in the doorway. He was dressed in rusty black, with a very broad brimmed top-hat and a loose white necktie\a151 the whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or of an undertaker\a146s mute. Yet, in spite of his shabby and even absurd appearance, his voice had a sharp crackle, and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention.\a147Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman\a146s papers?\a148 he asked.\a147I am a private detective, and I am endeavouring to explain his disappearance.\a148\a147Oh, you are, are you. And who instructed you, eh?\a148\a147This gentleman, Mr. Staunton\a146s friend, was referred to me by Scotland Yard.\a148\a147Who are you, sir?\a148\a147I am Cyril Overton.\a148\a147Then it is you who sent me a telegram. My name is Lord Mount-James. I came round as quickly as the Bayswater \a146bus would bring me. So you have instructed a detective?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And are you prepared to meet the cost?\a148\a147I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey, when we find him, will be prepared to do that.\a148\a147But if he is never found, eh. Answer me that!\a148\a147In that case no doubt his family\a151\a151\a148\a147Nothing of the sort, sir!\a148 screamed the little man. \a147Don\a146t look to me for a penny\a151 not a penny. You understand that, Mr. Detective. I am all the family that this young man has got, and I tell you that I am not responsible. If he has any expectations it is due to the fact that I have never wasted money, and I do not propose to begin to do so now. As to those papers with which you are making so free, I may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them.\a148\a147Very good, sir,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147May I ask in the meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man\a146s disappearance?\a148\a147No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look after himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself I entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him.\a148\a147I quite understand your position,\a148 said Holmes, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \a147Perhaps you don\a146t quite understand mine. Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor man. If he has been kidnapped it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses. The fame of your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-James, and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house, your habits, and your treasure.\a148The face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his neckcloth.\a147Heavens, sir, what an idea. I never thought of such villainy. What inhuman rogues there are in the world. But Godfrey is a fine lad\a151 a staunch lad. Nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away. I\a146ll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening. In the meantime spare no pains, Mr. Detective. I beg you to leave no stone unturned to bring him safely back. As to money, well, so far as a fiver, or even a tenner, goes, you can always look to me.\a148Even in his chastened frame of mind the noble miser could give us no information which could help us, for he knew little of the private life of his nephew. Our only clue lay in the truncated telegram, and with a copy of this in his hand Holmes set forth to find a second link for his chain. We had shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had befallen them.There was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. We halted outside it.\a147It\a146s worth trying, Watson,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Of course, with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage yet. I don\a146t suppose they remember faces in so busy a place. Let us venture it.\a148\a147I am sorry to trouble you,\a148 said he, in his blandest manner, to the young woman behind the grating; \a147there is some small mistake about a telegram I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and I very much fear that I must have omitted to put my name at the end. Could you tell me if this was so?\a148The young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils.\a147What o\a146clock was it?\a148 she asked.\a147A little after six.\a148\a147Whom was it to?\a148Holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me. \a147The last words in it were \a145for God\a146s sake,\a146\a160\a148 he whispered, confidentially; \a147I am very anxious at getting no answer.\a148The young woman separated one of the forms.\a147This is it. There is no name,\a148 said she, smoothing it out upon the counter.\a147Then that, of course, accounts for my getting no answer,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure. Good morning, miss, and many thanks for having relieved my mind\a148. He chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more.\a147Well?\a148 I asked.\a147We progress, my dear Watson, we progress. I had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram, but I could hardly hope to succeed the very first time.\a148\a147And what have you gained?\a148\a147A starting-point for our investigation\a148. He hailed a cab. \a147King\a146s Cross Station,\a148 said he.\a147We have a journey, then?\a148\a147Yes; I think we must run down to Cambridge together. All the indications seem to me to point in that direction.\a148\a147Tell me,\a148 I asked, as we rattled up Gray\a146s Inn Road, \a147have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance? I don\a146t think that among all our cases I have known one where the motives are more obscure. Surely you don\a146t really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle?\a148\a147I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation. It struck me, however, as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person.\a148\a147It certainly did that. But what are your alternatives?\a148\a147I could mention several. You must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important match, and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side. It may, of course, be coincidence, but it is interesting. Amateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public, and it is possible that it might be worth someone\a146s while to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a race-horse. There is one explanation. A second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property, however modest his means may at present be, and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted.\a148\a147These theories take no account of the telegram.\a148\a147Quite true, Watson. The telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal, and we must not permit our attention to wander away from it. It is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge. The path of our investigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a considerable advance along it.\a148It was already dark when we reached the old University city. Holmes took a cab at the station, and ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr. Leslie Armstrong. A few minutes later we had stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare. We were shown in, and after a long wait were at last admitted into the consulting-room, where we found the doctor seated behind his table.It argues the degree in which I had lost touch with my profession that the name of Leslie Armstrong was unknown to me. Now I am aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school of the University, but a thinker of European reputation in more than one branch of science. Yet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance at the man, the square, massive face, the brooding eyes under the thatched brows, and the granite moulding of the inflexible jaw. A man of deep character, a man with an alert mind, grim, ascetic, self-contained, formidable\a151 so I read Dr. Leslie Armstrong. He held my friend\a146s card in his hand, and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features.\a147I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I am aware of your profession, one of which I by no means approve.\a148\a147In that, doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country,\a148 said my friend, quietly.\a147So far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime, sir, they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community, though I cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose. Where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals, when you rake up family matters which are better hidden, and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself. At the present moment, for example, I should be writing a treatise instead of conversing with you.\a148\a147No doubt, doctor; and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise. Incidentally I may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame, and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police. You may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the regular forces of the country. I have come to ask you about Mr. Godfrey Staunton.\a148\a147What about him?\a148\a147You know him, do you not?\a148\a147He is an intimate friend of mine.\a148\a147You are aware that he has disappeared?\a148\a147Ah, indeed!. There was no change of expression in the rugged features of the doctor.\a147He left his hotel last night. He has not been heard of.\a148\a147No doubt he will return.\a148\a147To-morrow is the \a146Varsity football match.\a148\a147I have no sympathy with these childish games. The young man\a146s fate interests me deeply, since I know him and like him. The football match does not come within my horizon at all.\a148\a147I claim your sympathy, then, in my investigation of Mr. Staunton\a146s fate. Do you know where he is?\a148\a147Certainly not.\a148\a147You have not seen him since yesterday?\a148\a147No, I have not.\a148\a147Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man?\a148\a147Absolutely.\a148\a147Did you ever know him ill?\a148\a147Never.\a148Holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor\a146s eyes. \a147Then perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas, paid by Mr. Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Armstrong of Cambridge. I picked it out from among the papers upon his desk.\a148The doctor flushed with anger.\a147I do not feel that there is any reason why I should render an explanation to you, Mr. Holmes.\a148Holmes replaced the bill in his note-book. \a147If you prefer a public explanation it must come sooner or later,\a148 said he. \a147I have already told you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence.\a148\a147I know nothing about it.\a148\a147Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in London?\a148\a147Certainly not.\a148\a147Dear me, dear me; the post-office again!\a148 Holmes sighed, wearily. \a147A most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from London by Godfrey Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening\a151 a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance\a151 and yet you have not had it. It is most culpable. I shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint.\a148Dr. Leslie Armstrong sprang up from behind his desk, and his dark face was crimson with fury.\a147I\a146ll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir,\a148 said he. \a147You can tell your employer, Lord Mount-James, that I do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents. No, sir, not another word!. He rang the bell furiously. \a147John, show these gentlemen out!. A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing.\a147Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,\a148 said he. \a147I have not seen a man who, if he turned his talents that way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town, which we cannot leave without abandoning our case. This little inn just opposite Armstrong\a146s house is singularly adapted to our needs. If you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night, I may have time to make a few inquiries.\a148These few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy proceeding than Holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly nine o\a146clock. He was pale and dejected, stained with dust, and exhausted with hunger and fatigue. A cold supper was ready upon the table, and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was ready to take that half comic and wholly philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were going awry. The sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window. A brougham and pair of greys under the glare of a gas-lamp stood before the doctor\a146s door.\a147It\a146s been out three hours,\a148 said Holmes; \a147started at half-past six, and here it is back again. That gives a radius of ten or twelve miles, and he does it once, or sometimes twice, a day.\a148\a147No unusual thing for a doctor in practice.\a148\a147But Armstrong is not really a doctor in practice. He is a lecturer and a consultant, but he does not care for general practice, which distracts him from his literary work. Why, then, does he make these long journeys, which must be exceedingly irksome to him, and who is it that he visits?\a148\a147His coachman\a151\a151\a148\a147My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to him that I first applied. I do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the promptings of his master, but he was rude enough to set a dog at me. Neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick, however, and the matter fell through. Relations were strained after that, and further inquiries out of the question. All that I have learned I got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn. It was he who told me of the doctor\a146s habits and of his daily journey. At that instant, to give point to his words, the carriage came round to the door.\a148\a147Could you not follow it?\a148\a147Excellent, Watson. You are scintillating this evening. The idea did cross my mind. There is, as you may have observed, a bicycle shop next to our inn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight. I rapidly overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I followed its lights until we were clear of the town. We had got well out on the country road when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. The carriage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly back to where I had also halted, and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not impede the passage of my bicycle. Nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it. I at once rode past the carriage, and, keeping to the main road, I went on for a few miles, and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed. There was no sign of it, however, and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads which I had observed. I rode back, but again saw nothing of the carriage, and now, as you perceive, it has returned after me. Of course, I had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton, and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of interest to us; but, now that I find he keeps so keen a look-out upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions, the affair appears more important, and I shall not be satisfied until I have made the matter clear.\a148\a147We can follow him to-morrow.\a148\a147Can we. It is not so easy as you seem to think. You are not familiar with Cambridgeshire scenery, are you. It does not lend itself to concealment. All this country that I passed over to-night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand, and the man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed to-night. I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton\a146s urgent message. He knows where the young man is\a151 to that I\a146ll swear\a151 and if he knows, then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. At present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition.\a148And yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the mystery. A note was handed in after breakfast, which Holmes passed across to me with a smile.\a147Sir,\a148 it ran, \a147I can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my movements. I have, as you discovered last night, a window at the back of my brougham, and if you desire a twenty-mile ride which will lead you to the spot from which you started, you have only to follow me. Meanwhile, I can inform you that no spying upon me can in any way help Mr. Godfrey Staunton, and I am convinced that the best service you can do to that gentleman is to return at once to London and to report to your employer that you are unable to trace him. Your time in Cambridge will certainly be wasted\a133 \a133 . \a147Yours faithfully\a133 \a133 \a133 \a147LESLIE ARMSTRONG.\a148\a147An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Well, well, he excites my curiosity, and I must really know more before I leave him.\a148\a147His carriage is at his door now,\a148 said I. \a147There he is stepping into it. I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. Suppose I try my luck upon the bicycle?\a148\a147No, no, my dear Watson. With all respect for your natural acumen I do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor. I think that possibly I can attain our end by some independent explorations of my own. I am afraid that I must leave you to your own devices, as the appearance of \itwo\i inquiring strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than I care for. No doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in this venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening.\a148Once more, however, my friend was destined to be disappointed. He came back at night weary and unsuccessful.\a147I have had a blank day, Watson. Having got the doctor\a146s general direction, I spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of Cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans and other local news agencies. I have covered some ground. Chesterton, Histon, Waterbeach, and Oakington have each been explored and have each proved disappointing. The daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such Sleepy Hollows. The doctor has scored once more. Is there a telegram for me?\a148\a147Yes; I opened it. Here it is: \a145Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon, Trinity College\a148. I don\a146t understand it.\a148\a147Oh, it is clear enough. It is from our friend Overton, and is in answer to a question from me. I\a146ll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon, and then I have no doubt that our luck will turn. By the way, is there any news of the match?\a148\a147Yes, the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last edition. Oxford won by a goal and two tries. The last sentences of the description say. \a145The defeat of the Light Blues may be entirely attributed to the unfortunate absence of the crack International, Godfrey Staunton, whose want was felt at every instant of the game. The lack of combination in the three-quarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-working pack.\a146\a160\a148\a147Then our friend Overton\a146s forebodings have been justified,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and football does not come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night, Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day.\a148I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand. He laughed at my expression of dismay, and laid it upon the table.\a147No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. It is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery. On this syringe I base all my hopes. I have just returned from a small scouting expedition and everything is favourable. Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get upon Dr. Armstrong\a146s trail to-day, and once on it I will not stop for rest or food until I run him to his burrow.\a148\a147In that case,\a148 said I, \a147we had best carry our breakfast with us, for he is making an early start. His carriage is at the door.\a148\a147Never mind. Let him go. He will be clever if he can drive where I cannot follow him. When you have finished come downstairs with me, and I will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in the work that lies before us.\a148When we descended I followed Holmes into the stable yard, where he opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared, white-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound.\a147Let me introduce you to Pompey,\a148 said he. \a147Pompey is the pride of the local draghounds, no very great flier, as his build will show, but a staunch hound on a scent. Well, Pompey, you may not be fast, but I expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle-aged London gentlemen, so I will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to your collar. Now, boy, come along, and show what you can do\a148. He led him across to the doctor\a146s door. The dog sniffed round for an instant, and then with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street, tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. In half an hour, we were clear of the town and hastening down a country road.\a147What have you done, Holmes?\a148 I asked.\a147A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. I walked into the doctor\a146s yard this morning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel. A draghound will follow aniseed from here to John o\a146 Groat\a146s, and our friend Armstrong would have to drive through the Cam before he would shake Pompey off his trail. Oh, the cunning rascal. This is how he gave me the slip the other night.\a148The dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a grass-grown lane. Half a mile farther this opened into another broad road, and the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town, which we had just quitted. The road took a sweep to the south of the town and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we started.\a147This \id\a233tour\i has been entirely for our benefit, then?\a148 said Holmes. \a147No wonder that my inquiries among those villages led to nothing. The doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth, and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception. This should be the village of Trumpington to the right of us. And, by Jove! here is the brougham coming round the corner. Quick, Watson, quick, or we are done!\a148He sprang through a gate into a field, dragging the reluctant Pompey after him. We had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage rattled past. I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong within, his shoulders bowed, his head sunk on his hands, the very image of distress. I could tell by my companion\a146s graver face that he also had seen.\a147I fear there is some dark ending to our quest,\a148 said he. \a147It cannot be long before we know it. Come, Pompey. Ah, it is the cottage in the field!\a148There could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey. Pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate where the marks of the brougham\a146s wheels were still to be seen. A footpath led across to the lonely cottage. Holmes tied the dog to the hedge, and we hastened onwards. My friend knocked at the little rustic door, and knocked again without response. And yet the cottage was not deserted, for a low sound came to our ears\a151 a kind of drone of misery and despair, which was indescribably melancholy. Holmes paused irresolute, and then he glanced back at the road which we had just traversed. A brougham was coming down it, and there could be no mistaking those grey horses.\a147By Jove, the doctor is coming back!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147That settles it. We are bound to see what it means before he comes.\a148He opened the door and we stepped into the hall. The droning sound swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long, deep wail of distress. It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up and I followed him. He pushed open a half-closed door and we both stood appalled at the sight before us.A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her calm, pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the bed, half sitting, half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose frame was racked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bitter grief that he never looked up until Holmes\a146s hand was on his shoulder.\a147Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?\a148\a147Yes, yes; I am\a151 but you are too late. She is dead.\a148The man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance. Holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation, and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance, when there was a step upon the stairs, and there was the heavy, stern, questioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door.\a147So, gentlemen,\a148 said he, \a147you have attained your end, and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. I would not brawl in the presence of death, but I can assure you that if I were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity.\a148\a147Excuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a little at cross-purposes,\a148 said my friend, with dignity. \a147If you could step downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair.\a148A minute later the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sitting-room below.\a147Well, sir?\a148 said he.\a147I wish you to understand, in the first place, that I am not employed by Lord Mount-James, and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman. When a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate, but having done so the matter ends so far as I am concerned; and so long as there is nothing criminal, I am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity. If, as I imagine, there is no breach of the law in this matter, you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my co-operation in keeping the facts out of the papers.\a148Dr. Armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung Holmes by the hand.\a147You are a good fellow,\a148 said he. \a147I had misjudged you. I thank Heaven that my compunction at leaving poor Staunton all alone in this plight caused me to turn my carriage back, and so to make your acquaintance. Knowing as much as you do, the situation is very easily explained. A year ago Godfrey Staunton lodged in London for a time, and became passionately attached to his landlady\a146s daughter, whom he married. She was as good as she was beautiful, and as intelligent as she was good. No man need be ashamed of such a wife. But Godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old nobleman, and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his inheritance. I knew the lad well, and I loved him for his many excellent qualities. I did all I could to help him to keep things straight. We did our very best to keep the thing from everyone, for when once such a whisper gets about it is not long before everyone has heard it. Thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion, Godfrey has up to now succeeded. Their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant who has at present gone for assistance to Trumpington. But at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife. It was consumption of the most virulent kind. The poor boy was half crazed with grief, and yet he had to go to London to play this match, for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret. I tried to cheer him up by a wire, and he sent me one in reply imploring me to do all I could. This was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen. I did not tell him how urgent the danger was, for I knew that he could do no good here, but I sent the truth to the girl\a146s father, and he very injudiciously communicated it to Godfrey. The result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy, and has remained in the same state, kneeling at the end of her bed, until this morning death put an end to her sufferings. That is all, Mr. Holmes, and I am sure that I can rely upon your discretion and that of your friend.\a148Holmes grasped the doctor\a146s hand.\a147Come, Watson,\a148 said he, and we passed from that house of grief into the pale sunlight of the winter day.\p\X1\BThe Abbey Grange\B\X1\c\i\m="abbe-03.png"\i\cIt was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning during the winter of \a14697 that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. It was Holmes. The candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face and told me at a glance that something was amiss.\a147Come, Watson, come!\a148 he cried. \a147The game is afoot. Not a word. Into your clothes and come!\a148Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint winter\a146s dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter and neither of us had broken our fast. It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station, and taken our places in the Kentish train, that we were sufficiently thawed, he to speak and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his pocket and read it aloud:\a151\a147Abbey Grange, Marsham, Kent, \a1473.30 a.m.\a147MY DEAR MR. HOLMES,\a151- I should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case. It is something quite in your line. Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I have found it, but I beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there.\a147Yours faithfully, STANLEY HOPKINS.\a148\a147Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection which atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. You slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader.\a148\a147Why do you not write them yourself?\a148 I said, with some bitterness.\a147I will, my dear Watson, I will. At present I am, as you know, fairly busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a text-book which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume. Our present research appears to be a case of murder.\a148\a147You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?\a148\a147I should say so. Hopkins\a146s writing shows considerable agitation, and he is not an emotional man. Yes, I gather there has been violence, and that the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. We are moving in high life, Watson; crackling paper, \a147E.B.\a148 monogram, coat-of-arms, picturesque address. I think that friend Hopkins will live up to his reputation and that we shall have an interesting morning. The crime was committed before twelve last night.\a148\a147How can you possibly tell?\a148\a147By an inspection of the trains and by reckoning the time. The local police had to be called in, they had to communicate with Scotland Yard, Hopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me. All that makes a fair night\a146s work. Well, here we are at Chislehurst Station, and we shall soon set our doubts at rest.\a148A drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us to a park gate, which was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster. The avenue ran through a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low, widespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of Palladio. The central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new. The youthful figure and alert, eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway.\a147I\a146m very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes. And you too, Dr. Watson. But, indeed, if I had my time over again I should not have troubled you, for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. You remember that Lewisham gang of burglars?\a148\a147What, the three Randalls?\a148\a147Exactly; the father and two sons. It\a146s their work. I have not a doubt of it. They did a job at Sydenham a fortnight ago, and were seen and described. Rather cool to do another so soon and so near, but it is they, beyond all doubt. It\a146s a hanging matter this time.\a148\a147Sir Eustace is dead, then?\a148\a147Yes; his head was knocked in with his own poker.\a148\a147Sir Eustace Brackenstall, the driver tells me.\a148\a147Exactly\a151 one of the richest men in Kent. Lady Brackenstall is in the morning-room. Poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. She seemed half dead when I saw her first. I think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts. Then we will examine the dining-room together.\a148Lady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. Seldom have I seen so graceful a figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful a face. She was a blonde, golden-haired, blue-eyed, and would, no doubt, have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard. Her sufferings were physical as well as mental, for over one eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling, which her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing assiduously with vinegar and water. The lady lay back exhausted upon a couch, but her quick, observant gaze as we entered the room, and the alert expression of her beautiful features, showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience. She was enveloped in a loose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black sequin-covered dinner-dress was hung upon the couch beside her.\a147I have told you all that happened, Mr. Hopkins,\a148 she said, wearily; \a147could you not repeat it for me. Well, if you think it necessary, I will tell these gentlemen what occurred. Have they been in the dining-room yet?\a148\a147I thought they had better hear your ladyship\a146s story first.\a148\a147I shall be glad when you can arrange matters. It is horrible to me to think of him still lying there\a148. She shuddered and buried her face in her hands. As she did so the loose gown fell back from her forearms. Holmes uttered an exclamation.\a147You have other injuries, madam. What is this?\a148 Two vivid red spots stood out on one of the white, round limbs. She hastily covered it.\a147It is nothing. It has no connection with the hideous business of last night. If you and your friend will sit down I will tell you all I can.\a147I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. I have been married about a year. I suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one. I fear that all our neighbours would tell you that, even if I were to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault may be partly mine. I was brought up in the freer, less conventional atmosphere of South Australia, and this English life, with its proprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. But the main reason lies in the one fact which is notorious to everyone, and that is that Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard. To be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night. It is a sacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding. I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land\a151 Heaven will not let such wickedness endure\a148. For an instant she sat up, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow. Then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing. At last she continued:\a151\a147I will tell you about last night. You are aware, perhaps, that in this house all servants sleep in the modern wing. This central block is made up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above. My maid Theresa sleeps above my room. There is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. This must have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did.\a147Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The servants had already gone to their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until I needed her services. I sat until after eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be trusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler\a146s pantry, the gun-room, the billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered, elderly man who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the fellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself I found that they had torn down the bell-rope and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-room table. I was so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering any sound. It was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. He was dressed in his shirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand. He rushed at one of the burglars, but another\a151 it was the elderly man\a151 stooped, picked the poker out of the grate, and struck him a horrible blow as he passed. He fell without a groan, and never moved again. I fainted once more, but again it could only have been a very few minutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in his hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly, with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been a father with his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then they came over and made sure that I was still securely bound. Finally they withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an hour before I got my mouth free. When I did so my screams brought the maid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is really all that I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.\a148\a147Any questions, Mr. Holmes?\a148 asked Hopkins.\a147I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall\a146s patience and time,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Before I go into the dining-room I should like to hear your experience\a148. He looked at the maid.\a147I saw the men before ever they came into the house,\a148 said she. \a147As I sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was more than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor with his blood and brains over the room. It was enough to drive a woman out of her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him; but she never wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide, and Lady Brackenstall of Abbey Grange hasn\a146t learned new ways. You\a146ve questioned her long enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.\a148With a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room.\a147She has been with her all her life,\a148 said Hopkins. \a147Nursed her as a baby, and came with her to England when they first left Australia eighteen months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid you don\a146t pick up nowadays. This way, Mr. Holmes, if you please!\a148The keen interest had passed out of Holmes\a146s expressive face, and I knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them. An abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles would experience something of the annoyance which I read in my friend\a146s eyes. Yet the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest.It was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken panelling, and a fine array of deer\a146s heads and ancient weapons around the walls. At the farther end from the door was the high French window of which we had heard. Three smaller windows on the right-hand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. On the left was a large, deep fireplace, with a massive, over-hanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and cross-bars at the bottom. In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the lady the cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it had been secured still remained. These details only struck our attention afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the tiger-skin hearthrug in front of the fire.It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age. He lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning through his short black beard. His two clenched hands were raised above his head, and a heavy blackthorn stick lay across them. His dark, handsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression. He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he wore a foppish embroidered night-shirt, and his bare feet projected from his trousers. His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down. Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought.\a147He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall,\a148 he remarked.\a147Yes,\a148 said Hopkins. \a147I have some record of the fellow, and he is a rough customer.\a148\a147You should have no difficulty in getting him.\a148\a147Not the slightest. We have been on the look-out for him, and there was some idea that he had got away to America. Now that we know the gang are here I don\a146t see how they can escape. We have the news at every seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. What beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the lady could describe them, and that we could not fail to recognise the description.\a148\a147Exactly. One would have expected that they would have silenced Lady Brackenstall as well.\a148\a147They may not have realized,\a148 I suggested, \a147that she had recovered from her faint.\a148\a147That is likely enough. If she seemed to be senseless they would not take her life. What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have heard some queer stories about him.\a148\a147He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really went the whole way. The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he was capable of anything. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. There was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire\a151 her ladyship\a146s dog, to make the matter worse\a151 and that was only hushed up with difficulty. Then he threw a decanter at that maid, Theresa Wright; there was trouble about that. On the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking at now?\a148Holmes was down on his knees examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. Then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down.\a147When this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly,\a148 he remarked.\a147No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right at the back of the house.\a148\a147How did the burglar know no one would hear it. How dared he pull at a bell-rope in that reckless fashion?\a148\a147Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the very question which I have asked myself again and again. There can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been in close league with one of the servants. Surely that is evident. But there are eight servants, and all of good character.\a148\a147Other things being equal,\a148 said Holmes, \a147one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter. And yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. Well, well, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The lady\a146s story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every detail which we see before us\a148. He walked to the French window and threw it open. \a147There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one would not expect them. I see that these candles on the mantelpiece have been lighted.\a148\a147Yes; it was by their light and that of the lady\a146s bedroom candle that the burglars saw their way about.\a148\a147And what did they take?\a148\a147Well, they did not take much\a151 only half-a-dozen articles of plate off the sideboard. Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not ransack the house as they would otherwise have done.\a148\a147No doubt that is true. And yet they drank some wine, I understand.\a148\a147To steady their own nerves.\a148\a147Exactly. These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes; and the bottle stands as they left it.\a148\a147Let us look at it. Halloa! halloa! what is this?\a148The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine, and one of them containing some dregs of bees-wing. The bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply-stained cork. Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.A change had come over Holmes\a146s manner. He had lost his listless expression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen, deep-set eyes. He raised the cork and examined it minutely.\a147How did they draw it?\a148 he asked.Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it lay some table linen and a large cork-screw.\a147Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?\a148\a147No; you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened.\a148\a147Quite so. As a matter of fact that screw was \inot\i used. This bottle was opened by a pocket-screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more than an inch and a half long. If you examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted. It has never been transfixed. This long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it with a single pull. When you catch this fellow you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession.\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 said Hopkins.\a147But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually \isaw\i the three men drinking, did she not?\a148\a147Yes; she was clear about that.\a148\a147Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said. And yet you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What, you see nothing remarkable. Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good morning, Hopkins. I don\a146t see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may occur. I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.\a148During our return journey I could see by Holmes\a146s face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then, by an effort, he would throw off the impression and talk as if the matter were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining-room of the Abbey Grange in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last, by a sudden impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him.\a147Excuse me, my dear fellow,\a148 said he, as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve; \a147I am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply \ican\a146t\i leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess cries out against it. It\a146s wrong\a151 it\a146s all wrong\a151 I\a146ll swear that it\a146s wrong. And yet the lady\a146s story was complete, the maid\a146s corroboration was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to put against that. Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had examined everything with care which I would have shown had we approached the case \ide novo\i and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, would I not then have found something more definite to go upon. Of course I should. Sit down on this bench, Watson, until a train for Chislehurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true. The lady\a146s charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment.\a147Surely there are details in her story which, if we looked at it in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. These burglars made a considerable haul at Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part. As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, it is unusual for burglars to operate at so early an hour; it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream; it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man; it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there is much more within their reach; and finally I should say that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?\a148\a147Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them is quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.\a148\a147Well, I am not so clear about that, Watson; for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady\a146s story. And now on the top of this comes the incident of the wine-glasses.\a148\a147What about the wine-glasses?\a148\a147Can you see them in your mind\a146s eye?\a148\a147I see them clearly.\a148\a147We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as likely?\a148\a147Why not. There was wine in each glass.\a148\a147Exactly; but there was bees-wing only in one glass. You must have noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?\a148\a147The last glass filled would be most likely to contain bees-wing.\a148\a147Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. There are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the bees-wing. That does not appear probable. No, no; I am sure that I am right.\a148\a147What, then, do you suppose?\a148\a147That only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people had been here. In that way all the bees-wing would be in the last glass, would it not. Yes, I am convinced that this is so. But if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is the mission which now lies before us, and here, Watson, is the Chislehurst train.\a148The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to head-quarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations which formed the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared. Seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the demonstration of his professor, I followed every step of that remarkable research. The window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope\a151 each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered. The body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, but all else remained as we had seen it in the morning. Then, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece. Far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire. For a long time he gazed upward at it, and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall. This brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention. Finally he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction.\a147It\a146s all right, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147We have got our case\a151 one of the most remarkable in our collection. But, dear me, how slow-witted I have been, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my lifetime. Now, I think that with a few missing links my chain is almost complete.\a148\a147You have got your men?\a148\a147Man, Watson, man. Only one, but a very formidable person. Strong as a lion\a151 witness the blow that bent that poker. Six foot three in height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers; finally, remarkably quick-witted, for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. Yes, Watson, we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual. And yet in that bell-rope he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt.\a148\a147Where was the clue?\a148\a147Well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope, Watson, where would you expect it to break. Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire. Why should it break three inches from the top as this one has done?\a148\a147Because it is frayed there?\a148\a147Exactly. This end, which we can examine, is frayed. He was cunning enough to do that with his knife. But the other end is not frayed. You could not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever. You can reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did he do. He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put his knee on the bracket\a151 you will see the impression in the dust\a151 and so got his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at least three inches, from which I infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than I. Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair. What is it?\a148\a147Blood.\a148\a147Undoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the lady\a146s story out of court. If she were seated on the chair when the crime was done, how comes that mark. No, no; she was placed in the chair \iafter\i the death of her husband. I\a146ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this. We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but this is our Marengo, for it begins in defeat and ends in victory. I should like now to have a few words with the nurse Theresa. We must be wary for awhile, if we are to get the information which we want.\a148She was an interesting person, this stern Australian nurse. Taciturn, suspicious, ungracious, it took some time before Holmes\a146s pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding amiability. She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer.\a147Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. I heard him call my mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there. Then it was that he threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was for ever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She will not even tell me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that they come from a stab with a hat-pin. The sly fiend\a151 Heaven forgive me that I should speak of him so, now that he is dead, but a fiend he was if ever one walked the earth. He was all honey when first we met him, only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She had only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her first voyage\a151 she had never been from home before. He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways. If she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. What month did we meet him. Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were married in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand.\a148Lady Brackenstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter than before. The maid had entered with us, and began once more to foment the bruise upon her mistress\a146s brow.\a147I hope,\a148 said the lady, \a147that you have not come to cross-examine me again?\a148\a147No,\a148 Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, \a147I will not cause you any unnecessary trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make things easy for you, for I am convinced that you are a much-tried woman. If you will treat me as a friend and trust me you may find that I will justify your trust.\a148\a147What do you want me to do?\a148\a147To tell me the truth.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes!\a148\a147No, no, Lady Brackenstall, it is no use. You may have heard of any little reputation which I possess. I will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication.\a148Mistress and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes.\a147You are an impudent fellow!\a148 cried Theresa. \a147Do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie?\a148Holmes rose from his chair.\a147Have you nothing to tell me?\a148\a147I have told you everything.\a148\a147Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. Would it not be better to be frank?\a148For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask.\a147I have told you all I know.\a148Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. \a147I am sorry,\a148 he said, and without another word we left the room and the house. There was a pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. It was frozen over, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan. Holmes gazed at it and then passed on to the lodge gate. There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins and left it with the lodge-keeper.\a147It may be a hit or it may be a miss, but we are bound to do something for friend Hopkins, just to justify this second visit,\a148 said he. \a147I will not quite take him into my confidence yet. I think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the Adelaide-Southampton line, which stands at the end of Pall Mall, if I remember right. There is a second line of steamers which connect South Australia with England, but we will draw the larger cover first.\a148Holmes\a146s card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention, and he was not long in acquiring all the information which he needed. In June of \a14695 only one of their line had reached a home port. It was the \iRock of Gibraltar\i, their largest and best boat. A reference to the passenger list showed that Miss Fraser of Adelaide, with her maid, had made the voyage in her. The boat was now on her way to Australia, somewhere to the south of the Suez Canal. Her officers were the same as in \a14695, with one exception. The first officer, Mr. Jack Croker, had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship, the \iBass Rock\i, sailing in two days\a146 time from Southampton. He lived at Sydenham, but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions, if we cared to wait for him.No; Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know more about his record and character.His record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to touch him. As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild, desperate fellow off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable, but loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the pith of the information with which Holmes left the office of the Adelaide-Southampton company. Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but instead of entering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. Finally he drove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent off a message, and then, at last, we made for Baker Street once more.\a147No, I couldn\a146t do it, Watson,\a148 said he, as we re-entered our room. \a147Once that warrant was made out nothing on earth would save him. Once or twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. I have learned caution now, and I had rather play tricks with the law of England than with my own conscience. Let us know a little more before we act.\a148Before evening we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well with him.\a147I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human. Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?\a148\a147I didn\a146t know it.\a148\a147But you told me to examine it.\a148\a147You got it, then?\a148\a147Yes, I got it.\a148\a147I am very glad if I have helped you.\a148\a147But you haven\a146t helped me. You have made the affair far more difficult. What sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond?\a148\a147It was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. I was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it, who merely took it for a blind as it were, then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it.\a148\a147But why should such an idea cross your mind?\a148\a147Well, I thought it was possible. When they came out through the French window there was the pond, with one tempting little hole in the ice, right in front of their noses. Could there be a better hiding-place?\a148\a147Ah, a hiding-place\a151 that is better!\a148 cried Stanley Hopkins. \a147Yes, yes, I see it all now. It was early, there were folk upon the roads, they were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond, intending to return for it when the coast was clear. Excellent, Mr. Holmes\a151 that is better than your idea of a blind.\a148\a147Quite so; you have got an admirable theory. I have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver.\a148\a147Yes, sir, yes. It was all your doing. But I have had a bad set-back.\a148\a147A set-back?\a148\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were arrested in New York this morning.\a148\a147Dear me, Hopkins. That is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in Kent last night.\a148\a147It is fatal, Mr. Holmes, absolutely fatal. Still, there are other gangs of three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard.\a148\a147Quite so; it is perfectly possible. What, are you off?\a148Yes, Mr. Holmes; there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom of the business. I suppose you have no hint to give me?\a148\a147I have given you one.\a148\a147Which?\a148\a147Well, I suggested a blind.\a148\a147But why, Mr. Holmes, why?\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s the question, of course. But I commend the idea to your mind. You might possibly find that there was something in it. You won\a146t stop for dinner. Well, good-bye, and let us know how you get on.\a148Dinner was over and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the matter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire. Suddenly he looked at his watch.\a147I expect developments, Watson.\a148\a147When?\a148\a147Now\a151 within a few minutes. I dare say you thought I acted rather badly to Stanley Hopkins just now?\a148\a147I trust your judgment.\a148\a147A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look at it this way: what I know is unofficial; what he knows is official. I have the right to private judgment, but he has none. He must disclose all, or he is a traitor to his service. In a doubtful case I would not put him in so painful a position, and so I reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter.\a148\a147But when will that be?\a148\a147The time has come. You will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama.\a148There was a sound upon the stairs, and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. He was a very tall young man, golden-moustached, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns, and a springy step which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong. He closed the door behind him, and then he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking down some overmastering emotion.\a147Sit down, Captain Croker. You got my telegram?\a148Our visitor sank into an arm-chair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes.\a147I got your telegram, and I came at the hour you said. I heard that you had been down to the office. There was no getting away from you. Let\a146s hear the worst. What are you going to do with me. Arrest me. Speak out, man. You can\a146t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.\a148\a147Give him a cigar,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Bite on that, Captain Croker, and don\a146t let your nerves run away with you. I should not sit here smoking with you if I thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure of that. Be frank with me, and we may do some good. Play tricks with me, and I\a146ll crush you.\a148\a147What do you wish me to do?\a148\a147To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last night\a151 a \itrue\i account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken off. I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight I\a146ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands for ever.\a148The sailor thought for a little. Then he struck his leg with his great, sun-burned hand.\a147I\a146ll chance it,\a148 he cried. \a147I believe you are a man of your word, and a white man, and I\a146ll tell you the whole story. But one thing I will say first. So far as I am concerned I regret nothing and I fear nothing, and I would do it all again and be proud of the job. Curse the beast, if he had as many lives as a cat he would owe them all to me. But it\a146s the lady, Mary\a151 Mary Fraser\a151 for never will I call her by that accursed name. When I think of getting her into trouble, I who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face, it\a146s that that turns my soul into water. And yet\a151 and yet\a151 what less could I do. I\a146ll tell you my story, gentlemen, and then I\a146ll ask you as man to man what less could I do.\a147I must go back a bit. You seem to know everything, so I expect that you know that I met her when she was a passenger and I was first officer of the \iRock of Gibraltar\i. From the first day I met her she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.\a147Next time I came back from sea I heard of her marriage. Well, why shouldn\a146t she marry whom she liked. Title and money\a151 who could carry them better than she. She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty. I didn\a146t grieve over her marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as that. I just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and that she had not thrown herself away on a penniless sailor. That\a146s how I loved Mary Fraser.\a147Well, I never thought to see her again; but last voyage I was promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of months with my people at Sydenham. One day out in a country lane I met Theresa Wright, her old maid. She told me about her, about him, about everything. I tell you, gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. This drunken hound, that he should dare to raise his hand to her whose boots he was not worthy to lick. I met Theresa again. Then I met Mary herself\a151 and met her again. Then she would meet me no more. But the other day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week, and I determined that I would see her once before I left. Theresa was always my friend, for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as much as I did. From her I learned the ways of the house. Mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. I crept round there last night and scratched at the window. At first she would not open to me, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. She whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and I found it open before me so as to let me into the dining-room. Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman that I loved. Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window, in all innocence, as Heaven is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman, and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. I had sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. See here on my arm where his first blow fell. Then it was my turn, and I went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. Do you think I was sorry. Not I. It was his life or mine, but far more than that it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman. That was how I killed him. Was I wrong. Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my position?\a148\a147She had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old Theresa down from the room above. There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and I opened it and poured a little between Mary\a146s lips, for she was half dead with the shock. Then I took a drop myself. Theresa was as cool as ice, and it was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that burglars had done the thing. Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress, while I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural, else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to carry out the idea of a robbery, and there I left them with orders to give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour\a146s start. I dropped the silver into the pond and made off for Sydenham, feeling that for once in my life I had done a real good night\a146s work. And that\a146s the truth and the whole truth, Mr. Holmes, if it costs me my neck.\a148Holmes smoked for some time in silence. Then he crossed the room and shook our visitor by the hand.\a147That\a146s what I think,\a148 said he. \a147I know that every word is true, for you have hardly said a word which I did not know. No one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell-rope from the bracket, and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair. Only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class of life, since she was trying hard to shield him and so showing that she loved him. You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once I had started upon the right trail.\a148\a147I thought the police never could have seen through our dodge.\a148\a147And the police haven\a146t; nor will they, to the best of my belief. Now, look here, Captain Croker, this is a very serious matter, though I am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected. I am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate. However, that is for a British jury to decide. Meanwhile I have so much sympathy for you that if you choose to disappear in the next twenty-four hours I will promise you that no one will hinder you.\a148\a147And then it will all come out?\a148\a147Certainly it will come out.\a148The sailor flushed with anger.\a147What sort of proposal is that to make a man. I know enough of law to understand that Mary would be had as accomplice. Do you think I would leave her alone to face the music while I slunk away. No, sir; let them do their worst upon me, but for Heaven\a146s sake, Mr. Holmes, find some way of keeping my poor Mary out of the courts.\a148Holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor.\a147I was only testing you, and you ring true every time. Well, it is a great responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint, and if he can\a146t avail himself of it I can do no more. See here, Captain Croker, we\a146ll do this in due form of law. You are the prisoner. Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one. I am the judge. Now, gentleman of the jury, you have heard the evidence. Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?\a148\a147Not guilty, my lord,\a148 said I.\a147\iVox populi, vox Dei\i. You are acquitted, Captain Croker. So long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me. Come back to this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night.\a148\p\X1\BThe Second Stain\B\X1\c\i\m="seco-08.png"\i\cI had intended \a147The Adventure of the Abbey Grange\a148 to be the last of those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I had given a promise that \a147The Adventure of the Second Stain\a148 should be published when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence.It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs, and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them. The Premier\a146s thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain.\a147When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o\a146clock this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his suggestion that we have both come to you.\a148\a147Have you informed the police?\a148\a147No, sir,\a148 said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. \a147We have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.\a148\a147And why, sir?\a148\a147Because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily\a151 I might almost say probably\a151 lead to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known.\a148\a147I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared.\a148\a147That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter\a151 for it was a letter from a foreign potentate\a151 was received six days ago. It was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone.\a148\a147What time did you dine?\a148\a147Half-past seven.\a148\a147How long was it before you went to bed?\a148\a147My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was half-past eleven before we went to our room.\a148\a147Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?\a148\a147No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife\a146s maid, during the rest of the day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch-box.\a148\a147Who did know of the existence of that letter?\a148\a147No one in the house.\a148\a147Surely your wife knew?\a148\a147No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this morning.\a148The Premier nodded approvingly.\a147I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,\a148 said he. \a147I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.\a148The European Secretary bowed.\a147You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.\a148\a147Could she have guessed?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed\a151 nor could anyone have guessed.\a148\a147Have you lost any documents before?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter?\a148\a147Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!. His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned. \a147Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you.\a148\a147But abroad?\a148\a147I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. I am well convinced that his Ministers\a151 that the usual official channels have not been employed.\a148Holmes considered for some little time.\a147Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is, and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?\a148The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier\a146s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown.\a147Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is addressed in large, bold handwriting to\a151-\a147\a147I fear, sir,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that, interesting and indeed essential as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. What \iwas\i the letter?\a148\a147That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.\a148Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.\a147You are two of the most busy men in the country,\a148 said he, \a147and in my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time.\a148The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. \a147I am not accustomed, sir\a151\a151\a148 he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders.\a147We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence.\a148\a147I agree with you, sir,\a148 said the younger statesman.\a147Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out.\a148\a147You may safely trust us.\a148\a147The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely. Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter. At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war.\a148Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier.\a147Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter\a151 this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men\a151 which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.\a148\a147Have you informed the sender?\a148\a147Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.\a148\a147Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.\a148\a147No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out.\a148\a147If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out. Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?\a148\a147There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?\a148\a147Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?\a148\a147To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.\a148Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.\a147It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?\a148Holmes shook his head mournfully.\a147You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be war?\a148 \a147I think it is very probable.\a148\a147Then, sir, prepare for war.\a148\a147That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at that hour, where can it be now. No one has any reason to retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it. It is beyond our reach.\a148The Prime Minister rose from the settee.\a147What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.\a148\a147Let us presume, for argument\a146s sake, that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet\a151\a151\a148\a147They are both old and tried servants.\a148\a147I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it. To whom would the thief take it. To one of several international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post. If one is missing\a151 especially if he has disappeared since last night\a151 we will have some indication as to where the document has gone.\a148\a147Why should he be missing?\a148 asked the European Secretary. \a147He would take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not.\a148\a147I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations with the Embassies are often strained.\a148The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.\a147I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.\a148The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\a147Yes,\a148 said he, \a147there is no better way of approaching it. The situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If it\a146s on the market I\a146ll buy it\a151 if it means another penny on the income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game; there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each of them.\a148I glanced at my morning paper.\a147Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You will not see him.\a148\a147Why not?\a148\a147He was murdered in his house last night.\a148M\ty friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair:\a151\a147MURDER IN WESTMINSTER\a148\a147A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16, Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey, almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament. This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at Hammersmith. From ten o\a146clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. He knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger, plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.\a148\t\a147Well, Watson, what do you make of this?\a148 asked Holmes, after a long pause.\a147It is an amazing coincidence.\a148\a147A coincidence. Here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected\a151\imust\i be connected. It is for us to find the connection.\a148\a147But now the official police must know all.\a148\a147Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They know\a151 and shall know\a151 nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only \iwe\i know of both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes\a146 walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have named live in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the European Secretary\a146s household\a151 a small thing, and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential. Halloa! what have we here?\a148Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady\a146s card upon her salver. Holmes glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.\a147Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up,\a148 said he.A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self-command. Terror\a151 not beauty\a151 was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door.\a147Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Yes, madam, he has been here.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here.\a148 Holmes bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.\a147Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot make any unconditional promise.\a148She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window. It was a queenly presence\a151 tall, graceful, and intensely womanly.\a147Mr. Holmes,\a148 she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke\a147I will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing. Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence. Now it is essential\a151 essential, I say\a151 that I should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then, Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client\a146s interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?\a148\a147Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.\a148She groaned and sank her face in her hands.\a147You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld. It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom you must ask.\a148\a147I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point.\a148\a147What is it, madam?\a148\a147Is my husband\a146s political career likely to suffer through this incident?\a148\a147Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect.\a148\a147Ah!. She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved.\a147One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document.\a148\a147If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.\a148\a147Of what nature are they?\a148\a147Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer.\a148\a147Then I will take up no more of your time. I cannot blame you, Mr. Holmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side will not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even against his will, to share my husband\a146s anxieties. Once more I beg that you will say nothing of my visit\a148. She looked back at us from the door, and I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.\a147Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department,\a148 said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling \ifrou-frou\i of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door. \a147What was the fair lady\a146s game? What did she really want?\a148\a147Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.\a148\a147Hum. Think of her appearance, Watson\a151 her manner, her suppressed excitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. Remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.\a148\a147She was certainly much moved.\a148\a147Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all. What did she mean by that. And you must have observed, Watson, how she manoeuvred to have the light at her back. She did not wish us to read her expression.\a148\a147Yes; she chose the one chair in the room.\a148\a147And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her nose\a151 that proved to be the correct solution. How can you build on such a quicksand. Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling-tongs. Good morning, Watson.\a148\a147You are off?\a148\a147Yes; I will wile away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends of the regular establishment. With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of our problem, though I must admit that I have not an inkling as to what form it may take. It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts. Do you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive any fresh visitors. I\a146ll join you at lunch if I am able.\a148All that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn, and others morose. He ran out and ran in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual questions which I put to him. It was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest. He would say nothing of the case, and it was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest, and the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton, the valet of the deceased. The coroner\a146s jury brought in the obvious \a147Wilful Murder,\a148 but the parties remained as unknown as ever. No motive was suggested. The room was full of articles of value, but none had been taken. The dead man\a146s papers had not been tampered with. They were carefully examined, and showed that he was a keen student of international politics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an untiring letter-writer. He had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries. But nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers. As to his relations with women, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. He had many acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he loved. His habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. His death was an absolute mystery, and likely to remain so.As to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it was a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction. But no case could be sustained against him. He had visited friends in Hammersmith that night. The \ialibi\i was complete. It is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to Westminster before the time when the crime was discovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. He had actually arrived at twelve o\a146clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy. He had always been on good terms with his master. Several of the dead man\a146s possessions\a151 notably a small case of razors\a151 had been found in the valet\a146s boxes, but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story. Mitton had been in Lucas\a146s employment for three years. It was noticeable that Lucas did not take Mitton on the Continent with him. Sometimes he visited Paris for three months on end, but Mitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. As to the housekeeper, she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him.S\to for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow it in the papers. If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every development. Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from Paris which seemed to solve the whole question.\a147A discovery has just been made by the Parisian police,\a148 said the \iDaily Telegraph\i, \a147which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of Mr. Eduardo Lucas, who met his death by violence last Monday night at Godolphin Street, Westminster. Our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some suspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an \ialibi\i. Yesterday a lady, who has been known as Mme. Henri Fournaye, occupying a small villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane. An examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form. On inquiry the police have discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye only returned from a journey to London on Tuesday last, and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at Westminster. A comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Eduardo Lucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in London and Paris. Mme. Fournaye, who is of Creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy. It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in London. Her movements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced, but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at Charing Cross Station on Tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures. It is probable, therefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. At present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the doctors hold out no hopes of the re-establishment of her reason. There is evidence that a woman, who might have been Mme. Fournaye, was seen for some hours on Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street.\a148\t\a147What do you think of that, Holmes?\a148 I had read the account aloud to him, while he finished his breakfast.\a147My dear Watson,\a148 said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room, \a147you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell. Even now this report from Paris does not help us much.\a148\a147Surely it is final as regards the man\a146s death.\a148\a147The man\a146s death is a mere incident\a151 a trivial episode\a151 in comparison with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European catastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly from the Government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose\a151 no, it \ican\a146t\i be loose\a151 but if it isn\a146t loose, where can it be. Who has it. Why is it held back. That\a146s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared. Did the letter ever reach him. If so, why is it not among his papers. Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her. If so, is it in her house in Paris. How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused. It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man\a146s hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my latest from the front!. He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. \a147Halloa. Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to Westminster.\a148It was my first visit to the scene of the crime\a151 a high, dingy, narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which gave it birth. Lestrade\a146s bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in. The room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained, save an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. This carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful, old-fashioned wood-flooring in square blocks highly polished. Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of which had been used on that tragic night. In the window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy.\a147Seen the Paris news?\a148 asked Lestrade.Holmes nodded.\a147Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt it\a146s just as they say. She knocked at the door\a151 surprise visit, I guess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments. He let her in\a151 couldn\a146t keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced him, reproached him, one thing led to another, and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. It wasn\a146t all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it. We\a146ve got it all clear as if we had seen it.\a148Holmes raised his eyebrows.\a147And yet you have sent for me?\a148\a147Ah, yes, that\a146s another matter\a151 a mere trifle, but the sort of thing you take an interest in\a151 queer, you know, and what you might call freakish. It has nothing to do with the main fact\a151 can\a146t have, on the face of it.\a148\a147What is it, then?\a148\a147Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position. Nothing has been moved. Officer in charge here day and night. This morning, as the man was buried and the investigation over\a151 so far as this room is concerned\a151 we thought we could tidy up a bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down; only just laid there. We had occasion to raise it. We found\a151\a151\a148\a147Yes. You found\a151\a151\a148Holmes\a146s face grew tense with anxiety.\a147Well, I\a146m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find. You see that stain on the carpet. Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?\a148\a147Undoubtedly it must.\a148\a147Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.\a148\a147No stain. But there must\a151\a151\a148\a147Yes; so you would say. But the fact remains that there isn\a146t.\a148He took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed as he said.\a147But the underside is as stained as the upper. It must have left a mark.\a148Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert.\a147Now I\a146ll show you the explanation. There \iis\i a second stain, but it does not correspond with the other. See for yourself\a148. As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. \a147What do you make of that, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Why, it is simple enough. The two stains did correspond, but the carpet has been turned round. As it was square and unfastened it was easily done.\a148The official police don\a146t need you, Mr. Holmes, to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round. That\a146s clear enough, for the stains lie above each other\a151 if you lay it over this way. But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?\a148I could see from Holmes\a146s rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement.\a147Look here, Lestrade,\a148 said he, \a147has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time?\a148\a147Yes, he has.\a148\a147Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don\a146t do it before us. We\a146ll wait here. You take him into the back room. You\a146ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. Don\a146t ask him if he has done it. Take it for granted. Tell him you \iknow\i someone has been here. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I tell you!\a148\a147By George, if he knows I\a146ll have it out of him!\a148 cried Lestrade. He darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room.\a147Now, Watson, now!\a148 cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small black cavity opened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. It was empty.\a147Quick, Watson, quick. Get it back again!. The wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade\a146s voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns.\a147Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come in here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct.\a148The big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room.\a147I meant no harm, sir, I\a146m sure. The young woman came to the door last evening\a151 mistook the house, she did. And then we got talking. It\a146s lonesome, when you\a146re on duty here all day.\a148\a147Well, what happened then?\a148\a147She wanted to see where the crime was done\a151 had read about it in the papers, she said. She was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman, sir, and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep. When she saw that mark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she were dead. I ran to the back and got some water, but I could not bring her to. Then I went round the corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy, and by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off\a151 ashamed of herself, I dare say, and dared not face me.\a148\a147How about moving that drugget?\a148\a147Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when I came back. You see, she fell on it, and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place. I straightened it out afterwards.\a148\a147It\a146s a lesson to you that you can\a146t deceive me, Constable MacPherson,\a148 said Lestrade, with dignity. \a147No doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room. It\a146s lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find yourself in Queer Street. I\a146m sorry to have called you down over such a petty business, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you.\a148\a147Certainly, it was most interesting. Has this woman only been here once, constable?\a148\a147Yes, sir, only once.\a148\a147Who was she?\a148\a147Don\a146t know the name, sir. Was answering an advertisement about type-writing, and came to the wrong number\a151 very pleasant, genteel young woman, sir.\a148\a147Tall. Handsome?\a148\a147Yes, sir; she was a well-grown young woman. I suppose you might say she was handsome. Perhaps some would say she was very handsome. \a145Oh, officer, do let me have a peep!\a146 says she. She had pretty, coaxing ways, as you might say, and I thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door.\a148\a147How was she dressed?\a148\a147Quiet, sir\a151 a long mantle down to her feet.\a148\a147What time was it?\a148\a147It was just growing dusk at the time. They were lighting the lamps as I came back with the brandy.\a148\a147Very good,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Come, Watson, I think that we have more important work elsewhere.\a148As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand. The constable stared intently.\a147Good Lord, sir!\a148 he cried, with amazement on his face. Holmes put his finger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast-pocket, and burst out laughing as we turned down the street. \a147Excellent!\a148 said he. \a147Come, friend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident.\a148My mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man.\a147You have solved it!\a148 I cried.\a147Hardly that, Watson. There are some points which are as dark as ever. But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a head.\a148When we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were shown into the morning-room.\a147Mr. Holmes!\a148 said the lady, and her face was pink with her indignation. \a147this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. I desired, as I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband should think that I was intruding into his affairs. And yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us.\a148\a147Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible alternative. I have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper. I must therefore ask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.\a148The lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face. Her eyes glazed\a151 she tottered\a151 I thought that she would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock, and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features.\a147You\a151 you insult me, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up the letter.\a148She darted to the bell.\a147The butler shall show you out.\a148\a147Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If you do, then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated. Give up the letter and all will be set right. If you will work with me I can arrange everything. If you work against me I must expose you.\a148She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had forborne to ring it.\a147You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very manly thing, Mr. Holmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. You say that you know something. What is it that you know?\a148\a147Pray sit down, madam. You will hurt yourself there if you fall. I will not speak until you sit down. Thank you.\a148\a147I give you five minutes, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, of your giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room last night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding-place under the carpet.\a148She stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak.\a147You are mad, Mr. Holmes\a151 you are mad!\a148 she cried, at last.He drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. It was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait.\a147I have carried this because I thought it might be useful,\a148 said he. \a147The policeman has recognised it.\a148She gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair.\a147Come, Lady Hilda. You have the letter. The matter may still be adjusted. I have no desire to bring trouble to you. My duty ends when I have returned the lost letter to your husband. Take my advice and be frank with me; it is your only chance.\a148Her courage was admirable. Even now she would not own defeat.\a147I tell you again, Mr. Holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.\a148Holmes rose from his chair.\a147I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. I have done my best for you; I can see that it is all in vain.\a148He rang the bell. The butler entered.\a147Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?\a148\a147He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.\a148Holmes glanced at his watch.\a147Still a quarter of an hour,\a148 said he. \a147Very good, I shall wait.\a148The butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda was down on her knees at Holmes\a146s feet, her hands out-stretched, her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears.\a147Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes. Spare me!\a148 she pleaded, in a frenzy of supplication. \a147For Heaven\a146s sake, don\a146t tell him. I love him so. I would not bring one shadow on his life, and this I know would break his noble heart.\a148Holmes raised the lady. \a147I am thankful, madam, that you have come to your senses even at this last moment. There is not an instant to lose. Where is the letter?\a148She darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long blue envelope.\a147Here it is, Mr. Holmes. Would to Heaven I had never seen it!\a148\a147How can we return it?\a148 Holmes muttered. \a147Quick, quick, we must think of some way. Where is the despatch-box?\a148\a147Still in his bedroom.\a148\a147What a stroke of luck. Quick, madam, bring it here!\a148A moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand.\a147How did you open it before. You have a duplicate key. Yes, of course you have. Open it!\a148From out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key. The box flew open. It was stuffed with papers. Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document. The box was shut, locked, and returned to the bedroom.\a147Now we are ready for him,\a148 said Holmes; \a147we have still ten minutes. I am going far to screen you, Lady Hilda. In return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,\a148 cried the lady. \a147Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of sorrow. There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I do, and yet if he knew how I have acted\a151 how I have been compelled to act\a151 he would never forgive me. For his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes. My happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!\a148\a147Quick, madam, the time grows short!\a148\a147It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indiscreet letter written before my marriage\a151 a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. Had he read that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed. It is years since I wrote it. I had thought that the whole matter was forgotten. Then at last I heard from this man, Lucas, that it had passed into his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. I implored his mercy. He said that he would return my letter if I would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband\a146s despatch-box. He had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence. He assured me that no harm could come to my husband. Put yourself in my position, Mr. Holmes. What was I to do?\a148\a147Take your husband into your confidence.\a148\a147I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not. On the one side seemed certain ruin; on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband\a146s paper, still in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences, while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I took an impression of his key; this man Lucas furnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-box, took the paper, and conveyed it to Godolphin Street.\a148\a147What happened there, madam?\a148\a147I tapped at the door as agreed. Lucas opened it. I followed him into his room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone with the man. I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered. Our business was soon done. He had my letter on his desk; I handed him the document. He gave me the letter. At this instant there was a sound at the door. There were steps in the passage. Lucas quickly turned back the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and covered it over.\a147What happened after that is like some fearful dream. I have a vision of a dark, frantic face, of a woman\a146s voice, which screamed in French, \a145My waiting is not in vain. At last, at last I have found you with her!. There was a savage struggle. I saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife gleamed in hers. I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house, and only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result. That night I was happy, for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the future would bring.\a147It was the next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one trouble for another. My husband\a146s anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart. I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what I had done. But that again would mean a confession of the past. I came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence. From the instant that I grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband\a146s paper. It must still be where Lucas had placed it, for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. If it had not been for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was. How was I to get into the room. For two days I watched the place, but the door was never left open. Last night I made a last attempt. What I did and how I succeeded, you have already learned. I brought the paper back with me, and thought of destroying it since I could see no way of returning it, without confessing my guilt to my husband. Heavens, I hear his step upon the stair!\a148The European Secretary burst excitedly into the room.\a147Any news, Mr. Holmes, any news?\a148 he cried.\a147I have some hopes.\a148\a147Ah, thank heaven!. His face became radiant. \a147The Prime Minister is lunching with me. May he share your hopes. He has nerves of steel, and yet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. Jacobs, will you ask the Prime Minister to come up. As to you, dear, I fear that this is a matter of politics. We will join you in a few minutes in the dining-room.\a148The Prime Minister\a146s manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague.\a147I understand that you have something to report, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Purely negative as yet,\a148 my friend answered. \a147I have inquired at every point where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended.\a148\a147But that is not enough, Mr. Holmes. We cannot live for ever on such a volcano. We must have something definite.\a148\a147I am in hopes of getting it. That is why I am here. The more I think of the matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this house.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes!\a148\a147If it had it would certainly have been public by now.\a148\a147But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?\a148\a147I am not convinced that anyone did take it.\a148\a147Then how could it leave the despatch-box?\a148\a147I am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch-box.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. You have my assurance that it left the box.\a148\a147Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?\a148\a147No; it was not necessary.\a148\a147You may conceivably have overlooked it.\a148\a147Impossible, I say.\a148\a147But I am not convinced of it; I have known such things to happen. I presume there are other papers there. Well, it may have got mixed with them.\a148\a147It was on the top.\a148\a147Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.\a148\a147No, no; I had everything out.\a148\a147Surely it is easily decided, Hope,\a148 said the Premier. \a147Let us have the despatch-box brought in.\a148The Secretary rang the bell.\a147Jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. This is a farcical waste of time, but still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. Thank you, Jacobs; put it here. I have always had the key on my watch-chain. Here are the papers, you see. Letter from Lord Merrow, report from Sir Charles Hardy, memorandum from Belgrade, note on the Russo-German grain taxes, letter from Madrid, note from Lord Flowers\a151 good heavens! what is this? Lord Bellinger. Lord Bellinger!\a148The Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand.\a147Yes, it is it\a151 and the letter is intact. Hope, I congratulate you.\a148\a147Thank you. Thank you. What a weight from my heart. But this is inconceivable\a151 impossible. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer. How did you know it was there?\a148\a147Because I knew it was nowhere else.\a148\a147I cannot believe my eyes!. He ran wildly to the door. \a147Where is my wife. I must tell her that all is well. Hilda. Hilda!\a148 we heard his voice on the stairs.The Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling eyes.\a147Come, sir,\a148 said he. \a147There is more in this than meets the eye. How came the letter back in the box?\a148Holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes.\a147We also have our diplomatic secrets,\a148 said he, and picking up his hat he turned to the door.\p\c\l\B\X0His Last Bow\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\c\p\X1\lWisteria Lodge\B\X1\c\i\m="wist-50.png"\i\c\X2\B1. The Singular Experience of Mr John Scott Eccles\B\X2I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of March in the year 1895. Holmes had received a telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.\a147I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,\a148 said he. \a147How do you define the word \a145grotesque\a146?\a148\a147Strange\a151 remarkable,\a148 I suggested.He shook his head at my definition.\a147There is surely something more than that,\a148 said he; \a147some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognise how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal. Think of that little affair of the red-headed men. That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.\a148\a147Have you it there?\a148 I asked.He read the telegram aloud.\a147Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience. May I consult you?\a147Scott Eccles,\a147Post-Office, Charing Cross.\a148\a147Man or woman?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram. She would have come.\a148\a147Will you see him?\a148\a147My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built. Life is commonplace; the papers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world. Can you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove? But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.\a148A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout, tall, grey-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room. His life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner. From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But same amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his business.\a147I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It is most improper\a151 most outrageous. I must insist upon some explanation.\a148 He swelled and puffed in his anger.\a147Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,\a148 said Holmes in a soothing voice. \a147May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?\a148\a147Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I could not leave it where it was. Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard your name\a151\a148\a147Quite so. But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?\a148\a147What do you mean?\a148Holmes glanced at his watch.\a147It is a quarter-past two,\a148 he said. \a147Your telegram was dispatched about one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.\a148Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.\a147You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running round making inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia\a146s rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.\a148\a147Come, come, sir,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147You are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and assistance.\a148Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.\a147I\a146m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But I will tell you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.\a148But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer. He shook hands with Holmes and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary.\a147We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes and our trail lay in this direction.\a148 He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. \a147Are you Mr. John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?\a148\a147I am.\a148\a147We have been following you about all the morning.\a148\a147You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent at Charing Cross Post-Office and came on here.\a148\a147But why do you follow me? What do you want?\a148\a147We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up to the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Esher.\a148Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from his astonished face.\a147Dead? Did you say he was dead?\a148\a147Yes, sir, he is dead.\a148\a147But how? An accident?\a148\a147Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.\a148\a147Good God! This is awful! You don\a146t mean\a151 you don\a146t mean that I am suspected?\a148\a147A letter of yours was found in the dead man\a146s pocket, and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.\a148\a147So I did.\a148\a147Oh, you did, did you?\a148Out came the official notebook.\a147Wait a bit, Gregson,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?\a148\a147And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against him.\a148\a147Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted. \a148Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face. With a dubious glance at the inspector\a146s notebook, he plunged at once into his extraordinary statement.\a147I am a bachelor,\a148 said he, \a147and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a large number of friends. Among these are the family of a retired brewer called Melville, living at Albemarle Mansion, Kensington. It was at his table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy. He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.\a147In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.\a147He had described his household to me before I went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs. This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him. Then there was a wonderful cook he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.\a147I drove to the place\a151 about two miles on the south side of Esher. The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. It was an old, tumble-down building in a crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly. He opened the door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality. I was handed over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag in his hand, to my bedroom. The whole place was depressing. Our dinner was \it\a205te-\a135-t\a205te\i, and though my host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. He continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impatience. The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us. I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.\a147One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the business that you two gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of it at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the servant. I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than before. He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents. About eleven I was glad to go to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my door\a151 the room was dark at the time\a151 and asked me if I had rung. I said that I had not. He apologised for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was nearly one o\a146clock. I dropped off after this and slept soundly all night.\a147And now I come to the amazing part of my tale. When I woke it was broad daylight. I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much astonished at this forgetfulness. I sprang up and rang for the servant. There was no response. I rang again and again, with the same result. Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water. You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there. I shouted in the hall. There was no answer. Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted. My host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. No reply. I turned the handle and walked in. The room was empty, and the bed had never been slept in. He had gone with the rest. The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in the night! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.\a148Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.\a147Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,\a148 said he. \a147May I ask, sir, what you did then?\a148\a147I was furious. My first idea was that I had been the victim of some absurd practical joke. I packed my things, banged the hall door behind me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan Brothers, the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented. It struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent. It is late in March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this theory would not work. The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent had been paid in advance. Then I made my way to town and called at the Spanish embassy. The man was unknown there. After this I went to see Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he really knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy has occurred. I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man. My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.\a148\a147I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles\a151 I am sure of it,\a148 said Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone. \a147I am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice. For example, there was that note which arrived during dinner. Did you chance to observe what became of it?\a148\a147Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.\a148\a147What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?\a148The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow. With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.\a147It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it. I picked this out unburned from the back of it.\a148Holmes smiled his appreciation.\a147You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper.\a148\a147I did, Mr. Holmes. It\a146s my way. Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?\a148The Londoner nodded.\a147The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-bladed scissors. It has been folded over three times and sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval object. It is addressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:\a147Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D.It is a woman\a146s writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else. It is thicker and bolder, as you see.\a148\a147A very remarkable note,\a148 said Holmes, glancing it over. \a147I must compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your examination of it. A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link\a151 what else is of such a shape? The scissors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.\a148The country detective chuckled.\a147I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was a little over,\a148 he said. \a147I\a146m bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as usual, was at the bottom of it.\a148Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.\a147I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,\a148 said he. \a147But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.\a148\a147As to Garcia,\a148 said Gregson, \a147that is easily answered. He was found dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded. It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot. He had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead. It was a most furious assault. There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.\a148\a147Robbed?\a148\a147No, there was no attempt at robbery.\a148\a147This is very painful\a151 very painful and terrible,\a148 said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice, \a147but it is really uncommonly hard upon me. I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end. How do I come to be mixed up with the case?\a148\a147Very simply, sir,\a148 Inspector Baynes answered. \a147The only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead man\a146s name and address. It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.\a148\a147I think now,\a148 said Gregson, rising, \a147we had best put this matter into an official shape. You will come round with us to the station, Mr. Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.\a148\a147Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain your services, Mr. Holmes. I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth.\a148My friend turned to the country inspector.\a147I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr. Baynes?\a148\a147Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.\a148\a147You appear to have been very prompt and business-like in all that you have done. Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man met his death?\a148\a147He had been there since one o\a146clock. There was rain about that time, and his death had certainly been before the rain.\a148\a147But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,\a148 cried our client. \a147His voice is unmistakable. I could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.\a148\a147Remarkable, but by no means impossible,\a148 said Holmes, smiling.\a147You have a clue?\a148 asked Gregson.\a147On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features. A further knowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final and definite opinion. By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?\a148The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.\a147There were,\a148 said he, \a147one or two \ivery\i remarkable things. Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them.\a148\a147I am entirely at your service,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the bell. \a147You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send the boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling reply.\a148We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes smoked hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.\a147Well, Watson,\a148 he asked, turning suddenly upon me, \a147what do you make of it?\a148\a147I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.\a148\a147But the crime?\a148\a147Well, taken with the disappearance of the man\a146s companions, I should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice.\a148\a147That is certainly a possible point of view. On the face of it you must admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest. They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week.\a148\a147Then why did they fly?\a148\a147Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both these big facts? If it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution.\a148\a147But what is our hypothesis?\a148Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.\a147You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible. There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.\a148\a147But what possible connection?\a148\a147Let us take it link by link. There is, on the face of it something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced the pace. He called upon Eccles at the other end of London on the very day after he first met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to Esher. Now, what did he want with Eccles? What could Eccles supply? I see no charm in the man. He is not particularly intelligent\a151 not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose? Has he any one outstanding quality? I say that he has. He is the very type of conventional British respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another Briton. You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.\a148\a147But what was he to witness?\a148\a147Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another way. That is how I read the matter.\a148\a147I see, he might have proved an alibi.\a148\a147Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi. We will suppose, for argument\a146s sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are confederates in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be, is to come off, we will say, before one o\a146clock. By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve. If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation. Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in his house all the time. It was an insurance against the worst.\a148\a147Yes, yes, I see that. But how about the disappearance of the others?\a148\a147I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories.\a148\a147And the message?\a148\a147How did it run? \a145Our own colours, green and white.\a146 Sounds like racing. \a145Green open, white shut.\a146 That is clearly a signal. \a145Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.\a146 This is an assignation. We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. It was clearly a dangerous quest. She would not have said \a145Godspeed\a146 had it not been so. \a145D\a146that should be a guide.\a148\a147The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that \a145D\a146 stands for Dolores, a common female name in Spain.\a148\a147Good, Watson, very good\a151 but quite inadmissible. A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly English. Well, we can only possess our souls in patience until this excellent inspector comes back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.\a148An answer had arrived to Holmes\a146s telegram before our Surrey officer had returned. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with a laugh.\a147We are moving in exalted circles,\a148 said he.The telegram was a list of names and addresses:Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes Hynes, J.P., Purdey Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.\a147This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,\a148 said Holmes. \a147No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already adopted some similar plan.\a148\a147I don\a146t quite understand.\a148\a147Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that the message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation. Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order to keep this tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one. It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid up to one o\a146clock. As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must be limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them.\a148It was nearly six o\a146clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at the Bull. Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us.\X2\B2. The Tiger of San Pedro\B\X2A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.\a147There\a146s a constable in possession,\a148 said Baynes. \a147I\a146ll knock at the window.\a148 He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room. An instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.\a147What\a146s the matter, Walters?\a148 asked Baynes sharply.The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of relief.\a147I am glad you have come, sir. It has been a long evening, and I don\a146t think my nerve is as good as it was.\a148\a147Your nerve, Walters? I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body.\a148\a147Well, sir, it\a146s this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen. Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again.\a148\a147That what had come again?\a148\a147The devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the window.\a148\a147What was at the window, and when?\a148\a147It was just about two hours ago. The light was just fading. I was sitting reading in the chair. I don\a146t know what made me look up, but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir, what a face it was! I\a146ll see it in my dreams.\a148\a147Tut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-constable.\a148\a147I know sir, I know; but it shook me sir, and there\a146s no use to deny it. It wasn\a146t black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know, but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it. Then there was the size of it\a151 it was twice yours, sir. And the look of it\a151 the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn\a146t move a finger, nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was gone. Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.\a148\a147If I didn\a146t know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black mark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?\a148\a147That, at least, is very easily settled,\a148 said Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern. \a147Yes,\a148 he reported, after a short examination of the grass bed, \a147a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.\a148\a147What became of him?\a148\a147He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.\a148\a147Well,\a148 said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, \a147whoever he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he\a146s gone for the present, and we have more immediate things to attend to. Now, Mr. Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house.\a148The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search. Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house. A good deal of clothing with the stamp of Marx and Co., High Holborn, had been left behind. Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer. Odds and ends, some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a guitar were among the personal property.\a147Nothing in all this,\a148 said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from room to room. \a147But now, Mr. Holmes, I invite your attention to the kitchen.\a148It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a straw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the cook. The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates, the debris of last night\a146s dinner.\a147Look at this,\a148 said Baynes. \a147What do you make of it?\a148He held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of the dresser. It was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult to say what it might have been. One could but say that it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish, human figure. At first, as I examined it, I thought that it was a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey. Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human. A double band of white shells was strung round the centre of it.\a147Very interesting\a151 very interesting, indeed!\a148 said Holmes, peering at this sinister relic. \a147Anything more?\a148In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle. The limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely to pieces with the feathers still on, were littered all over it. Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head.\a147A white cock,\a148 said he. \a147Most interesting! It is really a very curious case.\a148But Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. From under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood. Then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone.\a147Something has been killed and something has been burned. We raked all these out of the fire. We had a doctor in this morning. He says that they are not human.\a148Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands.\a147I must congratulate you, Inspector, on handling so distinctive and instructive a case. Your powers, if I may say so without offence, seem superior to your opportunities.\a148Inspector Baynes\a146s small eyes twinkled with pleasure.\a147You\a146re right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the provinces. A case of this sort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. What do you make of these bones?\a148\a147A lamb, I should say, or a kid.\a148\a147And the white cock?\a148\a147Curious, Mr. Baynes, very curious. I should say almost unique.\a148\a147Yes, sir, there must have been some very strange people with some very strange ways in this house. One of them is dead. Did his companions follow him and kill him? If they did we should have them, for every port is watched. But my own views are different. Yes, sir, my own views are very different.\a148\a147You have a theory then?\a148\a147And I\a146ll work it myself, Mr. Holmes. It\a146s only due to my own credit to do so. Your name is made, but I have still to make mine. I should be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without your help.\a148Holmes laughed good-humouredly.\a147Well, well, Inspector,\a148 said he. \a147Do you follow your path and I will follow mine. My results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen all that I wish in this house, and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere. \iAu revoir\i and good luck!\a148I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost upon anyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive as ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot. After his habit he said nothing, and after mine I asked no questions. Sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption. All would come round to me in due time.I waited, therefore\a151 but to my ever-deepening disappointment I waited in vain. Day succeeded day, and my friend took no step forward. One morning he spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that he had visited the British Museum. Save for this one excursion, he spent his days in long and often solitary walks, or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated.\a147I\a146m sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you,\a148 he remarked. \a147It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. With a spud, a tin box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days to be spent.\a148 He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening.O\tccasionally in our rambles we came across Inspector Baynes. His fat, red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion. He said little about the case, but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events. I must admit, however, that I was somewhat surprised when, some five days after the crime, I opened my morning paper to find in large letters:THE OXSHOTT MYSTERY A SOLUTIONARREST OF SUPPOSED ASSASSIN\tHolmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the headlines.\a147By Jove!\a148 he cried. \a147You don\a146t mean that Baynes has got him?\a148\a147Apparently,\a148 said I as I read the following report:\a147Great excitement was caused in Esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the Oxshott murder. It will be remembered that Mr. Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, was found dead on Oxshott Common, his body showing signs of extreme violence, and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled, which appeared to show their participation in the crime. It was suggested, but never proved, that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house, and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime. Every effort was made by Inspector Baynes, who has the case in hand, to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives, and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared. It was certain from the first, however, that they would eventually be detected, as the cook, from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window, was a man of most remarkable appearance\a151 being a huge and hideous mulatto, with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type. This man has been seen since the crime, for he was detected and pursued by Constable Walters on the same evening, when he had the audacity to revisit Wisteria Lodge. Inspector Baynes, considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely, therefore, to be repeated, abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery. The man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by the savage. We understand that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police, and that great developments are hoped from his capture.\a148\a147Really we must see Baynes at once,\a148 cried Holmes, picking up his hat. \a147We will just catch him before he starts.\a148 We hurried down the village street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings.\a147You\a146ve seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked, holding one out to us.\a147Yes, Baynes, I\a146ve seen it. Pray don\a146t think it a liberty if I give you a word of friendly warning.\a148\a147Of warning, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I have looked into this case with some care, and I am not convinced that you are on the right lines. I don\a146t want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure.\a148\a147You\a146re very kind, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147I assure you I speak for your good.\a148It seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of Mr. Baynes\a146s tiny eyes.\a147We agreed to work on our own lines, Mr. Holmes. That\a146s what I am doing.\a148\a147Oh, very good,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Don\a146t blame me.\a148\a147No, sir; I believe you mean well by me. But we all have our own systems, Mr. Holmes. You have yours, and maybe I have mine.\a148\a147Let us say no more about it.\a148\a147You\a146re welcome always to my news. This fellow is a perfect savage, as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil. He chewed Downing\a146s thumb nearly off before they could master him. He hardly speaks a word of English, and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.\a148\a147And you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master?\a148\a147I didn\a146t say so, Mr. Holmes\a151 I didn\a146t say so. We all have our little ways. You try yours and I will try mine. That\a146s the agreement.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. \a147I can\a146t make the man out. He seems to be riding for a fall. Well, as he says, we must each try our own way and see what comes of it. But there\a146s something in Inspector Baynes which I can\a146t quite understand.\a148\a147Just sit down in that chair, Watson,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes when we had returned to our apartment at the Bull. \a147I want to put you in touch with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it. Simple as it has been in its leading features, it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest. There are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill.\a147We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the evening of his death. We may put aside this idea of Baynes\a146s that Garcia\a146s servants were concerned in the matter. The proof of this lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged for the presence of Scott Eccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi. It was Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal enterprise, in hand that night in the course of which he met his death. I say \a145criminal\a146 because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi. Who, then, is most likely to have taken his life? Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed. So far it seems to me that we are on safe ground.\a147We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia\a146s household. They were \iall\i confederates in the same unknown crime. If it came off when Garcia returned, any possible suspicion would be warded off by the Englishman\a146s evidence, and all would be well. But the attempt was a dangerous one, and if Garcia did \inot\i return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed. It had been arranged, therefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt. That would fully explain the facts, would it not?\a148The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me. I wondered, as I always did, how it had not been obvious to me before.\a147But why should one servant return?\a148\a147We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious, something which he could not bear to part with, had been left behind. That would explain his persistence, would it not?\a148\a147Well, what is the next step?\a148\a147The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner. It indicates a confederate at the other end. Now, where was the other end? I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house, and that the number of large houses is limited. My first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants. One house, and only one, riveted my attention. It is the famous old Jacobean grange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side of Oxshott, and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy. The other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance. But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable, was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures might befall. I concentrated my attention, therefore, upon him and his household.\a147A singular set of people, Watson\a151 the man himself the most singular of them all. I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to read in his dark, deep-set, brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true business. He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-grey hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer, and the air of an emperor\a151 a fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit behind his parchment face. He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough as whipcord. His friend and secretary, Mr. Lucas, is undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown, wily, suave, and cat-like, with a poisonous gentleness of speech. You see, Watson, we have come already upon two sets of foreigners\a151 one at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable\a151 so our gaps are beginning to close.\a147These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the household; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important. Henderson has two children\a151 girls of eleven and thirteen. Their governess is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman of forty or thereabouts. There is also one confidential manservant. This little group forms the real family, for they travel about together, and Henderson is a great traveller, always on the move. It is only within the last few weeks that he has returned, after a year\a146s absence, to High Gable. I may add that he is enormously rich, and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them. For the rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidservants, and the usual overfed, underworked staff of a large English country-house.\a147So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation. There are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one. I call it luck, but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it. As Baynes remarks, we all have our systems. It was my system which enabled me to find John Warner, late gardener of High Gable, sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer. He in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master. So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment.\a147Curious people, Watson! I don\a146t pretend to understand it all yet, but very curious people anyway. It\a146s a double-winged house and the servants live on one side, the family on the other. There\a146s no link between the two save for Henderson\a146s own servant, who serves the family\a146s meals. Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms the one connection. Governess and children hardly go out at all, except into the garden. Henderson never by any chance walks alone. His dark secretary is like his shadow. The gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something. \a145Sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money,\a146 says Warner, \a145and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own.\a146 Where they came from, or who they are, nobody has an idea. They are very violent. Twice Henderson has lashed at folk with his dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts.\a147Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information. We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned. Who wrote the note? It was someone within the citadel, and it was a woman. Who then but Miss Burnet, the governess? All our reasoning seems to point that way. At any rate, we may take it as a hypothesis and see what consequences it would entail. I may add that Miss Burnet\a146s age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question.\a147If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of Garcia. What, then, might she be expected to do if she heard of his death? If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed. Still, in her heart, she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them. Could we see her, then, and try to use her? That was my first thought. But now we come to a sinister fact. Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder. From that evening she has utterly vanished. Is she alive? Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which we still have to decide.\a147You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman\a146s disappearance counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week. And yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life. All I can do is to watch the house and leave my agent, Warner, on guard at the gates. We can\a146t let such a situation continue. If the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves.\a148\a147What do you suggest?\a148\a147I know which is her room. It is accessible from the top of an outhouse. My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery.\a148It was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect. The old house with its atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants, the unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour. But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend. One knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be found. I clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast.But it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending. It was about five o\a146clock, and the shadows of the March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed into our room.\a147They\a146ve gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the last train. The lady broke away, and I\a146ve got her in a cab downstairs.\a148\a147Excellent, Warner!\a148 cried Holmes, springing to his feet. \a147Watson, the gaps are closing rapidly.\a148In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad grey iris. She was drugged with opium.\a147I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said our emissary, the discharged gardener. \a147When the carriage came out I followed it to the station. She was like one walking in her sleep, but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled. They pushed her into the carriage. She fought her way out again. I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. I shan\a146t forget the face at the carriage window as I led her away. I\a146d have a short life if he had his way\a151 the black-eyed, scowling, yellow devil.\a148We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug. Baynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly explained to him.\a147Why, sir, you\a146ve got me the very evidence I want,\a148 said the inspector warmly, shaking my friend by the hand. \a147I was on the same scent as you from the first.\a148\a147What! You were after Henderson?\a148\a147Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below. It was just who would get his evidence first.\a148\a147Then why did you arrest the mulatto?\a148Baynes chuckled.\a147I was sure Henderson, as he calls himself, felt that he was suspected, and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger. I arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him. I knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of getting at Miss Burnet.\a148Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector\a146s shoulder.-\a147You will rise high in your profession. You have instinct and intuition,\a148 said he.Baynes flushed with pleasure.\a147I\a146ve had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week. Wherever the High Gable folk go he will keep them in sight. But he must have been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. However, your man picked her up, and it all ends well. We can\a146t arrest without her evidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the better.\a148\a147Every minute she gets stronger,\a148 said Holmes, glancing at the governess. \a147But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?\a148\a147Henderson,\a148 the inspector answered, \a147is Don Murillo, once called the Tiger of San Pedro.\a148The Tiger of San Pedro! The whole history of the man came back to me in a flash. He had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilisation. Strong, fearless, and energetic, he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years. His name was a terror through all Central America. At the end of that time there was a universal rising against him. But he was as cunning as he was cruel, and at the first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents. It was an empty palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day. The dictator, his two children, his secretary, and his wealth had all escaped them. From that moment he had vanished from the world, and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the European press.\a147Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro,\a148 said Baynes. \a147If you look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and white, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called himself, but I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where his ship came in in \a14686. They\a146ve been looking for him all the time for their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find him out.\a148\a147They discovered him a year ago,\a148 said Miss Burnet, who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation. \a147Once already his life has been attempted, but some evil spirit shielded him. Now, again, it is the noble, chivalrous Garcia who has fallen, while the monster goes safe. But another will come, and yet another, until some day justice will be done; that is as certain as the rise of to-morrow\a146s sun.\a148 Her thin hands clenched, and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred.\a147But how come you into this matter Miss Burnet?\a148 asked Holmes. \a147How can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?\a148\a147I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained. What does the law of England care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of treasure which this man has stolen? To you they are like crimes committed in some other planet. But \iwe\i know. We have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering. To us there is no fiend in hell like Juan Murillo, and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance.\a148\a147No doubt,\a148 said Holmes, \a147he was as you say I have heard that he was atrocious. But how are you affected?\a148\a147I will tell you it all. This villain\a146s policy was to murder, on one pretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might in time come to be a dangerous rival. My husband\a151 yes, my real name is Signora Victor Durando\a151 was the San Pedro minister in London. He met me and married me there. A nobler man never lived upon earth. Unhappily, Murillo heard of his excellence, recalled him on some pretext, and had him shot. With a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him. His estates were confiscated, and I was left with a pittance and a broken heart.\a147Then came the downfall of the tyrant. He escaped as you have just described. But the many whose lives he had ruined, whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands, would not let the matter rest. They banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done. It was my part after we had discovered in the transformed Henderson the fallen despot, to attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his movements. This I was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family. He little knew that the woman who faced him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hour\a146s notice into eternity. I smiled on him, did my duty to his children, and bided my time. An attempt was made in Paris and failed. We zig-zagged swiftly here and there over Europe to throw off the pursuers and finally returned to this house, which he had taken upon his first arrival in England.\a147But here also the ministers of justice were waiting. Knowing that he would return there, Garcia, who is the son of the former highest dignitary in San Pedro, was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station, all three fired with the same reasons for revenge. He could do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness. At night, however, he slept alone, and the avenger might find him. On a certain evening, which had been prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room. I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed.\a147But everything went wrong with us. In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez, the secretary. He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note. He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgement upon me as a convicted traitress. Then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous. But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia. They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address. I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia. Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, Jose. How they murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo\a146s hand who struck him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me. I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed. At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit might cease, since such a death might frighten others from the task.\a147All would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done. I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance. I was confined to my room, terrorised by the most horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit\a151 see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms\a151 and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window. For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being half-led, half-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the train. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did I suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back, and had it not been for the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I should never have broken away. Now, thank God, I am beyond their power forever.\a148We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement. It was Holmes who broke the silence.\a147Our difficulties are not over,\a148 he remarked, shaking his head. \a147Our police work ends, but our legal work begins.\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said I. \a147A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of self-defence. There may be a hundred crimes in the background, but it is only on this one that they can be tried.\a148\a147Come, come,\a148 said Baynes cheerily, \a147I think better of the law than that. Self-defence is one thing. To entice a man in cold blood with the object of murdering him is another, whatever danger you may fear from him. No, no, we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of High Gable at the next Guildford Assizes.\a148It is a matter of history, however, that a little time was still to elapse before the Tiger of San Pedro should meet with his deserts. Wily and bold, he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by entering a lodging-house in Edmonton Street and leaving by the back-gate into Curzon Square. From that day they were seen no more in England. Some six months afterwards the Marquess of Montalva and Signor Rulli, his secretary, were both murdered in their rooms at the Hotel Escurial at Madrid. The crime was ascribed to Nihilism, and the murderers were never arrested. Inspector Baynes visited us at Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary, and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes, and the tufted brows of his master. We could not doubt that justice, if belated, had come at last.\a147A chaotic case, my dear Watson,\a148 said Holmes over an evening pipe. \a147It will not be possible for you to present it in that compact form which is dear to your heart. It covers two continents, concerns two groups of mysterious persons, and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our friend, Scott Eccles, whose inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a well-developed instinct of self-preservation. It is remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we, with our worthy collaborator, the inspector, have kept our close hold on the essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path. Is there any point which is not quite clear to you?\a148\a147The object of the mulatto cook\a146s return?\a148\a147I think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it. The man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of San Pedro, and this was his fetish. When his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreat\a151 already occupied, no doubt by a confederate\a151 the companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture. But the mulatto\a146s heart was with it, and he was driven back to it next day, when, on reconnoitring through the window, he found policeman Walters in possession. He waited three days longer, and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more. Inspector Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimised the incident before me, had really recognised its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked. Any other point, Watson?\a148\a147The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery of that weird kitchen?\a148Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his notebook.\a147\tI spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other points. Here is a quotation from Eckermann\a146s \iVoodooism and the Negroid Religions:\iThe true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods. In extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by cannibalism. The more usual victims are a white cock, which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is cut and body burned.\t\a147\tSo you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is grotesque, Watson,\a148 Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook, \a147but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible.\a148\t\p\X1\BThe Bruce-Partington Plans\B\X1\c\i\m="bruc-02.png"\i\cIn the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his hobby\a151 the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the windowpanes, my comrade\a146s impatient and active nature could endure this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.\a147Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\a148 he said.I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come within the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his restless meanderings.\a147The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\a148 said he in the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \a147Look out of this window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloudbank. The thief or the murderer could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\a148\a147There have,\a148 said I, \a147been numerous petty thefts.\a148Holmes snorted his contempt.\a147This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than that,\a148 said he. \a147It is fortunate for this community that I am not a criminal.\a148\a147It is, indeed!\a148 said I heartily.\a147Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don\a146t have days of fog in the Latin countries\a151 the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony.\a148It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out laughing.\a147Well, well! What next?\a148 said he. \a147Brother Mycroft is coming round.\a148\a147Why not?\a148 I asked.\a147Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane. Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes Club, Whitehall\a151 that is his cycle. Once, and only once, he has been here. What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\a148\a147Does he not explain?\a148Holmes handed me his brother\a146s telegram.Must see you over Cadogan West. Coming at once.MYCROFT.\a147Cadogan West? I have heard the name.\a148\a147It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break out in this erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit. By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?\a148I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.\a147You told me that he had some small office under the British government.\a148Holmes chuckled.\a147I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that he is under the British government. You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he \iis\i the British government.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most indispensable man in the country.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself. There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living. The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business. The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential. In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant. Again and again his word has decided the national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I call upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. But Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who is Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\a148\a147I have it,\a148 I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the sofa. \a147Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan West was the young man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\a148Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.\a147This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he have to do with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself. He had not been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect violence. Is that not so?\a148\a147There has been an inquest,\a148 said I, \a147and a good many fresh facts have come out. Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a curious case.\a148\a147Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a most extraordinary one.\a148 He snuggled down in his armchair. \a147Now, Watson, let us have the facts.\a148\a147The man\a146s name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\a148\a147Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\a148\a147He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen by his \ifianc\a233\i, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about 7:30 that evening. There was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action. The next thing heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\a148\a147When?\a148\a147The body was found at six on the Tuesday morning. It was lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly crushed\a151 an injury which might well have been caused by a fall from the train. The body could only have come on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector is always standing. This point seems absolutely certain.\a148\a147Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train. So much is clear to me. Continue.\a148\a147The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was found are those which run from west to east, some being purely Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions. It can be stated for certain that this young man when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\a148\a147His ticket, of course, would show that.\a148\a147There was no ticket in his pockets.\a148\a147No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According to my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one\a146s ticket. Presumably, then, the young man had one. Was it taken from him in order to conceal the station from which he came? It is possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage? That also is possible. But the point is of curious interest. I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\a148\a147Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His purse contained two pounds fifteen. He had also a cheque-book on the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his identity was established. There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small packet of technical papers.\a148Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.\a147There we have it at last, Watson! British government\a151 Woolwich. Arsenal\a151 technical papers\a151 Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete. But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\a148A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-grey, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard\a151 thin and austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest. The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.\a147A most annoying business, Sherlock,\a148 said he. \a147I extremely dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office. But it is a real crisis. I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset. As to the Admiralty\a151 it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive. Have you read up the case?\a148\a147We have just done so. What were the technical papers?\a148\a147Ah, there\a146s the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\a148Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant.\a147Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of it.\a148\a147Only as a name.\a148\a147Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington\a146s operation. Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. Every effort has been made to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglarproof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London. From an official point of view it\a146s simply awful.\a148\a147But you have recovered them?\a148\a147No, Sherlock, no! That\a146s the pinch. We have not. Ten papers were taken from Woolwich. There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The three most essential are gone\a151 stolen, vanished. You must drop everything, Sherlock. Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It\a146s a vital international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right? Find an answer to all these questions, and you will have done good service for your country.\a148\a147Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as far as I.\a148\a147Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of getting details. Give me your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent expert opinion. But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye\a151 it is not my \im\a233tier\i. No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up. If you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list\a151\a148My friend smiled and shook his head.\a147I play the game for the game\a146s own sake,\a148 said he. \a147But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to look into it. Some more facts, please.\a148\a147I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of service. The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert, Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference. He has grown grey in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion. He is one of two who have a key of the safe. I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three o\a146clock taking his key with him. He was at the house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred.\a148\a147Has the fact been verified?\a148\a147Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\a148\a147Who was the other man with a key?\a148\a147The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson. He is a man of forty, married, with five children. He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service. He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker. According to his own account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it hangs.\a148\a147Tell us about Cadogan West.\a148\a147He has been ten years in the service and has done good work. He has the reputation of being hot-headed and impetuous, but a straight, honest man. We have nothing against him. He was next to Sidney Johnson in the office. His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans. No one else had the handling of them.\a148\a147Who locked the plans up that night?\a148\a147Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\a148\a147Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. They are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final, does it not?\a148\a147It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. In the first place, why did he take them?\a148\a147I presume they were of value?\a148\a147He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\a148\a147Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London except to sell them?\a148\a147No, I cannot.\a148\a147Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Young West took the papers. Now this could only be done by having a false key\a151\a148\a147Several false keys. He had to open the building and the room.\a148\a147He had, then, several false keys. He took the papers to London to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his end.\a148\a147How?\a148\a147We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment.\a148\a147Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station for London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\a148\a147Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London Bridge. There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having an absorbing interview. This interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life. Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end. The other closed the door. There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\a148\a147No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched. We will suppose, for argument\a146s sake, that young Cadogan West \ihad\i determined to convey these papers to London. He would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear. Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his \ifianc\a233\i halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared.\a148\a147A blind,\a148 said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation.\a147A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent. He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in his pocket. What had become of the other three? He certainly would not leave them of his own free will. Then, again, where is the price of his treason? One would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\a148\a147It seems to me perfectly clear,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147I have no doubt at all as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them. He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price. He started home again, but the agent went with him. In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage. That would account for everything, would it not?\a148\a147Why had he no ticket?\a148\a147The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent\a146s house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man\a146s pocket.\a148\a147Good, Lestrade, very good,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Your theory holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent. What is there for us to do?\a148\a147To act, Sherlock\a151 to act!\a148 cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \a147All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone unturned! In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country.\a148\a147Well, well!\a148 said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \a147Come, Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.\a148An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company.\a147This is where the young man\a146s body lay,\a148 said he, indicating a spot about three feet from the metals. \a147It could not have fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on Monday.\a148\a147Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\a148\a147There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\a148\a147No record of a door being found open?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about 11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just before the train reached the station. There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no report of it at the time. Why whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\a148My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy tufted brows which I knew so well.\a147Points,\a148 he muttered, \a147the points.\a148\a147What of it? What do you mean?\a148\a147I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?\a148\a147No; there are very few.\a148\a147And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were only so.\a148\a147What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?\a148\a147An idea\a151 an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I do not see any indications of bleeding on the line.\a148\a147There were hardly any.\a148\a147But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\a148\a147The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\a148\a147And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?\a148\a147I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and the carriages redistributed.\a148\a147I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Lestrade, \a147that every carriage has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself.\a148It was one of my friend\a146s most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.\a147Very likely,\a148 said he, turning away. \a147As it happens, it was not the carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\a148At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in England, with full address.SHERLOCK.\a147That should be helpful, Watson,\a148 he remarked as we took our seats in the Woolwich train. \a147We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.\a148His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought. See the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent\a151 such was the change in Holmes since the morning. He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.\a147There is material here. There is scope,\a148 said he. \a147I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.\a148\a147Even now they are dark to me.\a148\a147The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far. The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the \iroof\i of a carriage.\a148\a147On the roof!\a148\a147Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts. Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points? Is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off? The points would affect no object inside the train. Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred. But now consider the question of the blood. Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere. Each fact is suggestive in itself. Together they have a cumulative force.\a148\a147And the ticket, too!\a148 I cried.\a147Exactly. We could not explain the absence of a ticket. This would explain it. Everything fits together.\a148\a147But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\a148\a147Perhaps,\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully, \a147perhaps.\a148 He relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in Woolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew Mycroft\a146s paper from his pocket.\a147We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\a148 said he. \a147I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention. \a148The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns, stretching down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through. A butler answered our ring.\a147Sir James, sir!\a148 said he with solemn face. \a147Sir James died this morning.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 cried Holmes in amazement. \a147How did he die?\a148\a147Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel Valentine?\a148\a147Yes, we had best do so.\a148We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-bearded man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist. His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.\a147It was this horrible scandal,\a148 said he. \a147My brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair. It broke his heart. He was always so proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crushing blow.\a148\a147We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up.\a148\a147I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us. He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police. Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty. But all the rest was inconceivable.\a148\a147You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\a148\a147I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.\a148\a147This is indeed an unexpected development,\a148 said my friend when we had regained the cab. \a147I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself! If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty neglected? We must leave that question to the future. Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\a148A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother. The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the \ifianc\a233\i of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night.\a147I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\a148 she said. \a147I have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping. It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\a148\a147But the facts, Miss Westbury?\a148\a147Yes, yes I admit I cannot explain them.\a148\a147Was he in any want of money?\a148\a147No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample. He had saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\a148\a147No signs of any mental excitement? Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.\a148The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner. She coloured and hesitated.\a147Yes,\a148 she said at last, \a147I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.\a148\a147For long?\a148\a147Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried. Once I pressed him about it. He admitted that there was something, and that it was concerned with his official life. \a145It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you,\a146 said he. I could get nothing more.\a148Holmes looked grave.\a147Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We cannot say what it may lead to.\a148\a147Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\a148My friend\a146s face grew graver still.\a147Anything else?\a148\a147He said that we were slack about such matters\a151 that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans.\a148\a147Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\a148\a147Yes, quite recently.\a148\a147Now tell us of that last evening.\a148\a147We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so thick that a cab was useless. We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted away into the fog.\a148\a147Without a word?\a148\a147He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never returned. Then I walked home. Next morning, after the office opened, they came to inquire. About twelve o\a146clock we heard the terrible news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was so much to him.\a148Holmes shook his head sadly.\a147Come, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147our ways lie elsewhere. Our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken.\a147It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries make it blacker,\a148 he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \a147His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all very bad.\a148\a147But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then, again, why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a felony?\a148\a147Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formidable case which they have to meet.\a148Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received us with that respect which my companion\a146s card always commanded. He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been subjected.\a147It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the death of the chief?\a148\a147We have just come from his house.\a148\a147The place is disorganised. The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our papers stolen. And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we were as efficient an office as any in the government service. Good God, it\a146s dreadful to think of! That West, of all men, should have done such a thing!\a148\a147You are sure of his guilt, then?\a148\a147I can see no other way out of it. And yet I would have trusted him as I trust myself.\a148\a147At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\a148\a147At five.\a148\a147Did you close it?\a148\a147I am always the last man out.\a148\a147Where were the plans?\a148\a147In that safe. I put them there myself.\a148\a147Is there no watchman to the building?\a148\a147There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man. He saw nothing that evening. Of course the fog was very thick.\a148\a147Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building after hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could reach the papers?\a148\a147Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and the key of the safe.\a148\a147Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\a148\a147I had no keys of the doors\a151 only of the safe.\a148\a147Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\a148\a147Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those three keys are concerned he kept them on the same ring. I have often seen them there.\a148\a147And that ring went with him to London?\a148\a147He said so.\a148\a147And your key never left your possession?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate. And yet none was found upon his body. One other point: if a clerk in this office desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\a148\a147It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an effective way.\a148\a147But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West had that technical knowledge?\a148\a147No doubt we had, but I beg you won\a146t try to drag me into the matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in this way when the original plans were actually found on West?\a148\a147Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have equally served his turn.\a148\a147Singular, no doubt\a151 and yet he did so.\a148\a147Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable. Now there are three papers still missing. They are, as I understand, the vital ones.\a148\a147Yes, that is so.\a148\a147Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers and without the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\a148\a147I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But to-day I have been over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. The double valves with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers which have been returned. Until the foreigners had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat. Of course they might soon get over the difficulty.\a148\a147But the three missing drawings are the most important?\a148\a147Undoubtedly.\a148\a147I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the premises. I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\a148He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the iron shutters of the window. It was only when we were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush outside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped. He examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.\a147The indications are ruined by the three days\a146 delay. They may mean something or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can help us further. It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see if we can do better in London.\a148Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich Station. The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with confidence that he saw Cadogan West\a151 whom he knew well by sight\a151 upon the Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London Bridge. He was alone and took a single third-class ticket. The clerk was struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner. So shaky was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the lady about 7:30.\a147Let us reconstruct, Watson,\a148 said Holmes after half an hour of silence. \a147I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress.\a147The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us suppose, for example, that he had been approached by some foreign agent. It might have been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his remarks to his \ifianc\a233\i. Very good. We will now suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions. Everything gave way to his duty. He followed the man, reached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued the thief. In this way we get over the objection that no one would take originals when he could make copies. This outsider had to take originals. So far it holds together.\a148\a147What is the next step?\a148\a147Then we come into difficulties. One would imagine that under such circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm. Why did he not do so? Could it have been an official superior who took the papers? That would explain West\a146s conduct. Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he knew where the rooms were? The call must have been very pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no effort to communicate with her. Our scent runs cold here, and there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West\a146s body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work from the other end. If Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one.\a148Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A government messenger had brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw it over to me.There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an affair. The only men worth considering are Adolph Meyer, of 13 Great George Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions, Notting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington. The latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as having left. Glad to hear you have seen some light. The Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety. Urgent representations have arrived from the very highest quarter. The whole force of the State is at your back if you should need it.MYCROFT.\a147I\a146m afraid,\a148 said Holmes, smiling, \a147that all the queen\a146s horses and all the queen\a146s men cannot avail in this matter.\a148 He had spread out his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \a147Well, well,\a148 said he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \a147things are turning a little in our direction at last. Why Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off, after all.\a148 He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity. \a147I am going out now. It is only a reconnaissance. I will do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do you stay here, and the odds are that you will see me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy get foolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.\a148I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exultation. All the long November evening I waited, filled with impatience for his return. At last, shortly after nine o\a146clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:Am dining at Goldini\a146s Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please come at once and join me there. Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver.S. H.It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly away in my overcoat and drove straight to the address given. There sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.\a147Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curacao. Try one of the proprietor\a146s cigars. They are less poisonous than one would expect. Have you the tools?\a148\a147They are here, in my overcoat.\a148\a147Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with some indication of what we are about to do. Now it must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man\a146s body was \iplaced\i on the roof of the train. That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\a148\a147Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\a148\a147I should say it was impossible. If you examine the roofs you will find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round them. Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was placed on it.\a148\a147How could he be placed there?\a148\a147That was the question which we had to answer. There is only one possible way. You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels at some points in the West End. I had a vague memory that as I have travelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head. Now, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\a148\a147It seems most improbable.\a148\a147We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Here all other contingencies have failed. When I found that the leading international agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my sudden frivolity.\a148\a147Oh, that was it, was it?\a148\a147Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had become my objective. I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station, where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very spot.\a148\a147Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!\a148\a147So far\a151 so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well, having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a confederate entirely in his confidence. We must bear in mind that Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to him. Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\a148\a147Could we not get a warrant and legalise it?\a148\a147Hardly on the evidence.\a148\a147What can we hope to do?\a148\a147We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\a148\a147I don\a146t like it, Holmes.\a148\a147My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I\a146ll do the criminal part. It\a146s not a time to stick at trifles. Think of Mycroft\a146s note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who waits for news. We are bound to go.\a148My answer was to rise from the table.\a147You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go.\a148He sprang up and shook me by the hand.\a147I knew you would not shrink at the last,\a148 said he, and for a moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had ever seen. The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once more.\a147It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. Let us walk,\a148 said he. \a147Don\a146t drop the instruments, I beg. Your arrest as a suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication.\a148Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced, pillared, and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle Victorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door there appeared to be a children\a146s party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the night. The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly shade. Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.\a147This is a serious proposition,\a148 said he. \a147It is certainly bolted as well as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude. Give me a hand, Watson, and I\a146ll do the same for you.\a148A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog above. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew open. We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door behind us. Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair. His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.\a147Here we are, Watson\a151 this must be the one.\a148 He threw it open, and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light along the window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.\a147You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson! what is this? There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\a148 He was pointing to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window. \a147Here it is on the stone of the stair also. The demonstration is complete. Let us stay here until a train stops. \a148We had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window.\a147So far we are justified,\a148 said he. \a147What do you think of it, Watson?\a148\a147A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height.\a148\a147I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be insignificant. Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we may find something here which may help us.\a148We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon the first floor. One was a dining-room, severely furnished and containing nothing of interest. A second was a bedroom, which also drew blank. The remaining room appeared more promising, and my companion settled down to a systematic examination. It was littered with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere face. At the end of an hour he was no further than when he started.\a147The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\a148 said he. \a147He has left nothing to incriminate him. His dangerous correspondence has been destroyed or removed. This is our last chance.\a148It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes pried it open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what they referred. The recurring words \a147water pressure\a148 and \a147pressure to the square inch\a148 suggested some possible relation to a submarine. Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside. There only remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it. He shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had been raised.\a147What\a146s this, Watson? Eh? What\a146s this? Record of a series of messages in the advertisements of a paper. \iDaily Telegraph\i agony column by the print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates\a151 but messages arrange themselves. This must be the first:\a147Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed to. Write fully to address given on card.PIERROT.\a147Next comes:\a147Too complex for description. Must have full report. Stuff awaits you when goods delivered.PIERROT.\a147Then comes:\a147Matter presses. Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make appointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.PIERROT.\a147Finally:\a147Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.PIERROT.\a147A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at the man at the other end!\a148 He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the table. Finally he sprang to his feet.\a147Well, perhaps it won\a146t be so difficult, after all. There is nothing more to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive round to the offices of the \iDaily Telegraph\i, and so bring a good day\a146s work to a conclusion.\a148Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our proceedings of the day before. The professional shook his head over our confessed burglary.\a147We can\a146t do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147No wonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of these days you\a146ll go too far, and you\a146ll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\a148\a147For England, home and beauty\a151 eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of our country. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\a148\a147Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make of it?\a148Holmes picked up the \iDaily Telegraph\i which lay upon the table.\a147Have you seen Pierrot\a146s advertisement to-day?\a148\a147What? Another one?\a148\a147Yes, here it is:\a147To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most vitally important. Your own safety at stake.PIERROT.\a147By George!\a148 cried Lestrade. \a147If he answers that we\a146ve got him!\a148\a147That was my idea when I put it in. I think if you could both make it convenient to come with us about eight o\a146clock to Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\a148One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he could no longer work to advantage. I remember that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus. For my own part I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be interminable. The great national importance of the issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying\a151 all combined to work upon my nerve. It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of Oberstein\a146s house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine o\a146clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our man.An hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes. Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a minute at their watches. Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a sudden jerk.\a147He is coming,\a148 said he.There had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned. We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning to us to remain seated. The gas in the hall was a mere point of light. He opened the outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. \a147This way!\a148 we heard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us. Holmes had followed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room. Before our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes standing with his back against it. The man glared round him, staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.\a147You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147This was not the bird that I was looking for.\a148\a147Who is he?\a148 asked Mycroft eagerly.\a147The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the Submarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming to. I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\a148We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.\a147What is this?\a148 he asked. \a147I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\a148\a147Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\a148 said Holmes. \a147How an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension. But your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within our knowledge. So also are the circumstances connected with the death of young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance and confession, since there are still some details which we can only learn from your lips.\a148The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited, but he was silent.\a147I can assure you,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that every essential is already known. We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the \iDaily Telegraph\i. We are aware that you went down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous reason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. There he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more terrible crime of murder.\a148\a147I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I did not!\a148 cried our wretched prisoner.\a147Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage.\a148\a147I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the rest. I confess it. It was just as you say. A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. I needed the money badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It was to save myself from ruin. But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\a148\a147What happened, then?\a148\a147He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe. I never knew it until I was at the very door. It was thick fog, and one could not see three yards. I had given two taps and Oberstein had come to the door. The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver. He always carried it with him. As West forced his way after us into the house Oberstein struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the hall, and we were at our wit\a146s end what to do. Then Oberstein had this idea about the trains which halted under his back window. But first he examined the papers which I had brought. He said that three of them were essential, and that he must keep them. \a145You cannot keep them,\a146 said I. \a145There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.\a146 \a145I must keep them,\a146 said he, \a145for they are so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.\a146 \a145Then they must all go back together tonight,\a146 said I. He thought for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. \a145Three I will keep,\a146 said he. \a145The others we will stuff into the pocket of this young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly be put to his account. I could see no other way out of it, so we did as he suggested. We waited half an hour at the window before a train stopped. It was so thick that nothing could be seen, and we had no difficulty in lowering West\a146s body on to the train. That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\a148\a147And your brother?\a148\a147He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think that he suspected. I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know, he never held up his head again.\a148There was silence in the room. It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.\a147Can you not make reparation? It would ease your conscience, and possibly your punishment.\a148\a147What reparation can I make?\a148\a147Where is Oberstein with the papers?\a148\a147I do not know.\a148\a147Did he give you no address?\a148\a147He said that letters to the H\a244tel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually reach him.\a148\a147Then reparation is still within your power,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes.\a147I will do anything I can. I owe this fellow no particular good-will. He has been my ruin and my downfall.\a148\a147Here are paper and pen. Sit at this desk and write to my dictation. Direct the envelope to the address given. That is right. Now the letter:\a147DEAR SIR:\a147With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing. I have a tracing which will make it complete. This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds. I will not trust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes. I would come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the country at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday. Remember that only English notes, or gold, will be taken.That will do very well. I shall be very much surprised if it does not fetch our man.\a148And it did! It is a matter of history\a151 that secret history of a nation which is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public chronicles\a151 that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime, came to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British prison. In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his sentence. As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for private circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon the subject. Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin. When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission. He said no more, but I fancy that I could guess at that lady\a146s august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will forever recall to my friend\a146s memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington plans.\p\X1\BThe Devil\a146s Foot\B\X1\c\i\m="devi-05.png"\i\cIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and interesting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. To his sombre and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation. It was indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not any lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to lay very few of my records before the public. My participation in some of his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and reticence upon me.It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram from Holmes last Tuesday\a151 he has never been known to write where a telegram would serve\a151 in the following terms:Why not tell them of the Cornish horror\a151 strangest case I have handled.I have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes\a146s iron constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions of his own. In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of Harley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay aside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown. The state of his health was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of being permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete change of scene and air. Thus it was that in the early spring of that year we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at the further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.It was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim humour of my patient. From the windows of our little whitewashed house, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the whole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing vessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which innumerable seamen have met their end. With a northerly breeze it lies placid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it for rest and protection.Then come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blustering gale from the south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle in the creaming breakers. The wise mariner stands far out from that evil place.On the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was a country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-coloured, with an occasional church tower to mark the site of some old-world village. In every direction upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race which had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange monuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes of the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife. The glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he spent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the moor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and he had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the Chaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in tin. He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was settling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to his unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams, plunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more engrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had driven us from London. Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine were violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of a series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in Cornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers may retain some recollection of what was called at the time \a147The Cornish Horror,\a148 though a most imperfect account of the matter reached the London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true details of this inconceivable affair to the public.I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this part of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore. At his invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman\a146s scanty resources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he had little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical deformity. I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar garrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced, introspective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon his own affairs.These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little sitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion upon the moors.\a147Mr. Holmes,\a148 said the vicar in an agitated voice, \a147the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is the most unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special Providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all England you are the one man we need.\a148I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound who hears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the sofa, and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon it. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion.\a147Shall I speak or you?\a148 he asked of the vicar.\a147Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the speaking,\a148 said Holmes.I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes\a146s simple deduction had brought to their faces.\a147Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\a148 said the vicar, \a147and then you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening in the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister Brenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old stone cross upon the moor. He left them shortly after ten o\a146clock, playing cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and spirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that direction before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr. Richards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent call to Tredannick Wartha. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with him. When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary state of things. His two brothers and his sister were seated round the table exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of them and the candles burned down to their sockets. The sister lay back stone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her laughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them. All three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained upon their faces an expression of the utmost horror\a151 a convulsion of terror which was dreadful to look upon. There was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and housekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night. Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses. There is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you will have done a great work.\a148I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his intense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the expectation. He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the strange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\a147I will look into this matter,\a148 he said at last. \a147On the face of it, it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you been there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the vicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\a148\a147How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\a148\a147About a mile inland.\a148\a147Then we shall walk over together. But before we start I must ask you a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\a148The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene.\a147Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he eagerly. \a147It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\a148\a147Tell me about last night.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. We sat down about nine o\a146clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go. I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.\a148\a147Who let you out?\a148\a147Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. I shut the hall door behind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down. There was no change in door or window this morning, nor any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house. Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair. I\a146ll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.\a148\a147The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?\a148\a147It\a146s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\a148 cried Mortimer Tregennis. \a147It is not of this world. Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds. What human contrivance could do that?\a148\a147I fear,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?\a148\a147That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold out our venture to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us. I won\a146t deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.\a148\a147Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy? Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.\a148\a147There is nothing at all, sir.\a148\a147Your people were in their usual spirits?\a148\a147Never better.\a148\a147Were they nervous people? Did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger?\a148\a147Nothing of the kind.\a148\a147You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\a148Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\a147There is one thing occurs to me,\a148 said he at last. \a147As we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them. I couldn\a146t even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was something there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say.\a148\a147Did you not investigate?\a148\a147No; the matter passed as unimportant.\a148\a147You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\a148\a147None at all.\a148\a147I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\a148\a147I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me. He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message. I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we looked into that dreadful room. The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken. The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at least six hours. There were no signs of violence. She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face. George and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes. Oh, it was awful to see! I couldn\a146t stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well.\a148\a147Remarkable\a151 most remarkable!\a148 said Holmes, rising and taking his hat. \a147I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without further delay. I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.\a148Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. While we made our way along it we heard the raffle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\a147My brothers!\a148 cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \a147They are taking them to Helston.\a148We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their strange fate.It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with spring flowers. Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds. Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path. Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family. She readily answered all Holmes\a146s questions. She had heard nothing in the night. Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous. She had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor. The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.We ascended the stairs and viewed the body. Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age. Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion. From her bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over its surface. The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before. Holmes paced with light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions. He tested how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness.\a147Why a fire?\a148 he asked once. \a147Had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening?\a148Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. \a147What are you going to do now, Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked.My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. \a147I think, Watson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned,\a148 said he. \a147With your permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here. I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with you and the vicar. In the meantime I wish you both good-morning.\a148It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.\a147It won\a146t do, Watson!\a148 said he with a laugh. \a147Let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows. We are more likely to find them than clues to this problem. To let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces. The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson\a151 all else will come.\a147Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\a148 he continued as we skirted the cliffs together. \a147Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we \ido\i know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places. I take it, in the first place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men. Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good. There remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency. That is firm ground. Now, when did this occur? Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room. That is a very important point. The presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards. The cards still lay upon the table. It was already past their usual hour for bed. Yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs. I repeat then, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o\a146clock last night.\a147Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room. In this there is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible. The wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult\a151 having obtained a sample print\a151 to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements. He appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\a147If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed? Mrs. Porter may be eliminated. She is evidently harmless. Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses? The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden. That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy, cloudy, and dark. Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen. There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no indication of a footmark. It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt. You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\a148\a147They are only too clear,\a148 I answered with conviction.\a147And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I fancy that among your extensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.\a148I may have commented upon my friend\a146s power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon Celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution. It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand. Neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was. The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling, the beard\a151 golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar\a151 all these were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance. Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode. \a147The county police are utterly at fault,\a148 said he, \a147but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation. My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well\a151 indeed, upon my Cornish mother\a146s side I could call them cousins\a151 and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me. I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.\a148Holmes raised his eyebrows.\a147Did you lose your boat through it?\a148\a147I will take the next.\a148\a147Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\a148\a147I tell you they were relatives.\a148\a147Quite so\a151 cousins of your mother. Was your baggage aboard the ship?\a148\a147Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\a148\a147I see. But surely this event could not have found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.\a148\a147No, sir; I had a telegram.\a148\a147Might I ask from whom?\a148A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\a147You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147It is my business.\a148With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\a147I have no objection to telling you,\a148 he said. \a147It was Mr. Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It would be premature to say more.\a148\a147Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction?\a148\a147No, I can hardly answer that.\a148\a147Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\a148 The famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\a147From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\a148 he said. \a147I learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale\a146s account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What do you make of that, Watson?\a148\a147He is deeply interested.\a148\a147Deeply interested\a151 yes. There is a thread here which we have not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\a148Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation. I was shaving at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.\a147We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes! My poor parish is devil-ridden!\a148 he cried. \a147Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into his hands!\a148 He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he shot out his terrible news.\a147Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family.\a148Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.\a147Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\a148\a147Yes, I can.\a148\a147Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal. Hurry\a151 hurry, before things get disarranged. \a148The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large sitting-room; above, his bedroom. They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows. We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed. Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning. It has left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable. This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table. Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the window and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had marked the features of his dead sister. His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear. He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes\a146s phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover. In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight. Then he rushed down the stair, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry. The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl. He carefully scrutinised with his lens the tale shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook. Finally, just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.\a147I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\a148 he remarked. \a147I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive, and together they are almost conclusive. If the police would desire further information I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage. And now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.\a148It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days. During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to where he had been. One experiment served to show me the line of his investigation. He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy. This he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.\a147You will remember, Watson,\a148 he remarked one afternoon, \a147that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us. This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it. You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his brother\a146s house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair? You had forgotten? Well, I can answer for it that it was so. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window. In the second case\a151 that of Mortimer Tregennis himself\a151 you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window. That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive. In each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. In each case, also, there is combustion going on in the room\a151 in the one case a fire, in the other a lamp. The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit\a151 as a comparison of the oil consumed will show\a151 long after it was broad daylight. Why? Surely because there is some connection between three things\a151 the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those unfortunate people. That is clear, is it not?\a148\a147It would appear so.\a148\a147At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis. We will suppose, then, that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects. Very good. In the first instance\a151 that of the Tregennis family\a151 this substance was placed in the fire. Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney. Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less escape for the vapour. The result seems to indicate that it was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug. In the second case the result was complete. The facts, therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.\a147With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis\a146s room to find some remains of this substance. The obvious place to look was the talc shield or smoke-guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\a148\a147Why half, Holmes?\a148\a147It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found. The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it. Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the affair. Oh, you will see it out, will you? I thought I knew my Watson. This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face. The door we will leave ajar. Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming. Is that all clear? Well, then, I take our powder\a151 or what remains of it\a151 from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us sit down and await developments.\a148They were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control. A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe. Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul. A freezing horror took possession of me. I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding, that my mouth wag opened, and my tongue like leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap. I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from myself. At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes\a146s face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror\a151 the very look which I had seen upon the features of the dead. It was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone.\a147Upon my word, Watson!\a148 said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \a147I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable experiment even for one\a146s self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really very sorry.\a148\a147You know,\a148 I answered with some emotion, for I had never seen so much of Holmes\a146s heart before, \a147that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.\a148He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him. \a147It would be superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,\a148 said he. \a147A candid observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.\a148 He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm\a146s length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. \a147We must give the room a little time to clear. I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced?\a148\a147None whatever.\a148\a147But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour here and let us discuss it together. That villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat. I think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one. We must remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation. How bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell. When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him. He had a motive in misleading us. Finally, if he did not throw this substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who did do so? The affair happened immediately after his departure. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the table. Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors do not arrive after ten o\a146clock at night. We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\a148\a147Then his own death was suicide!\a148\a147Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself. There are, however, some cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time. Perhaps you would kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducting a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\a148I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure of the great African explorer appeared upon the path. He turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.\a147You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago, and I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\a148\a147Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence. You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present. Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\a148The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion.\a147I am at a loss to know, sir,\a148 he said, \a147what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\a148\a147The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\a148 said Holmes.For a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale\a146s fierce face turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hotheaded outburst.\a147I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\a148 said he, \a147that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\a148\a147Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not for the police.\a148Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time in his adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes\a146s manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.\a147What do you mean?\a148 he asked at last. \a147If this is bluff upon your part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us have no more beating about the bush. What \ido\i you mean?\a148\a147I will tell you,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and the reason why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness. What my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\a148\a147My defence?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147My defence against what?\a148\a147Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\a148Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. \a147Upon my word, you are getting on,\a148 said he. \a147Do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff?\a148\a147The bluff,\a148 said Holmes sternly, \a147is upon your side, Dr. Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine. As a proof I will tell you some of the facts upon which my conclusions are based. Of your return from Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama\a151\a148\a147I came back\a151\a148\a147I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate. We will pass that. You came down here to ask me whom I suspected. I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage, waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\a148\a147How do you know that?\a148\a147I followed you.\a148\a147I saw no one.\a148\a147That is what you may expect to see when I follow you. You spent a restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\a148Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.\a147You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. At the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring. You drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\a148Sterndale sprang to his feet.\a147I believe that you are the devil himself!\a148 he cried.Holmes smiled at the compliment. \a147It took two, or possibly three, handfuls before the lodger came to the window. You beckoned him to come down. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You entered by the window. There was an interview\a151 a short one\a151 during which you walked up and down the room. Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had come. Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what were the motives for your actions? If you prevaricate or trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands forever.\a148Our visitor\a146s face had turned ashen grey as he listened to the words of his accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands. Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.\a147That is why I have done it,\a148 said he.It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. Holmes stooped over it.\a147Brenda Tregennis,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\a148 repeated our visitor. \a147For years I have loved her. For years she has loved me. There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at. It has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for I have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of England, I could not divorce. For years Brenda waited. For years I waited. And this is what we have waited for.\a148 A terrible sob shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard. Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:\a147The vicar knew. He was in our confidence. He would tell you that she was an angel upon earth. That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned. What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my darling? There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Proceed,\a148 said my friend.Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table. On the outside was written \a147\iRadix pedis diaboli\i\a148 with a red poison label beneath it. He pushed it towards me. \a147I understand that you are a doctor, sir. Have you ever heard of this preparation?\a148\a147Devil\a146s-foot root! No, I have never heard of it.\a148\a147It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\a148 said he, \a147for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no other specimen in Europe. It has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology. The root is shaped like a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary. It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among them. This particular specimen I obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\a148 He opened the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.\a147Well, sir?\a148 asked Holmes sternly.\a147I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest that you should know all. I have already explained the relationship in which I stood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers. There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others. He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.\a147One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I showed him some of my African curiosities. Among other things I exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe. I told him also how powerless European science would be to detect it. How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil\a146s-foot root. I well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking.\a147I thought no more of the matter until the vicar\a146s telegram reached me at Plymouth. This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa. But I returned at once. Of course, I could not listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison had been used. I came round to see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself to you. But there could be none. I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the devil\a146s-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who has ever loved me. There was his crime; what was to be his punishment?\a147Should I appeal to the law? Where were my proofs? I knew that the facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a story? I might or I might not. But I could not afford to fail. My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to myself. So it was now. I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my own hand. In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon his own life than I do at the present moment.\a147Now I have told you all. You have yourself supplied the rest. I did, as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage. I foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his window. He came down and admitted me through the window of the sitting-room. I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had come both as judge and executioner. The wretch sank into a chair, paralysed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try to leave the room. In five minutes he died. My God! how he died! But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him. There is my story, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much yourself. At any rate, I am in your hands. You can take what steps you like. As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear death less than I do. \a148Holmes sat for some little time in silence.\a147What were your plans?\a148 he asked at last.\a147I had intended to bury myself in central Africa. My work there is but half finished.\a148\a147Go and do the other half,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I, at least, am not prepared to prevent you.\a148Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from the arbour. Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.\a147Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\a148 said he. \a147I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere. Our investigation has been independent, and our action shall be so also. You would not denounce the man?\a148\a147Certainly not,\a148 I answered.\a147I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done. Who knows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious. The gravel upon the window-sill was, of course, the starting-point of my research. It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden. Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart. The lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain. And now, my dear Watson, I think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\a148\p\X1\BThe Red Circle\B\X1\c\i\m="redc-03.png"\i\c\a147Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage me.\a148 So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material.But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly.\a147You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,\a148 she said\a147Mr. Fairdale Hobbs.\a148\a147Ah, yes\a151 a simple matter.\a148\a147But he would never cease talking of it\a151 your kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only would.\a148Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair.\a147Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then. You don\a146t object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson\a151 the matches! You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end.\a148\a147No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I can\a146t sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him\a151 it\a146s more than I can stand. My husband is as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it\a146s more than my nerves can stand.\a148Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman\a146s shoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed into their usual commonplace. She sat down in the chair which he had indicated\a147If I take it up I must understand every detail,\a148 said he. \a147Take time to consider. The smallest point may be the most essential. You say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight\a146s board and lodging?\a148\a147He asked my terms, sir. I said fifty shillings a week. There is a small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the house.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147He said, \a145I\a146ll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my own terms.\a146 I\a146m a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the money meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note, and he held it out to me then and there. \a145You can have the same every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms,\a146 he said. \a145If not, I\a146ll have no more to do with you.\a146\a160\a148\a147What were the terms?\a148\a147Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was all right. Lodgers often have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.\a148\a147Nothing wonderful in that, surely?\a148\a147Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason. He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor I, nor the girl has once set eyes upon him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down, up and down, night, morning, and noon; but except on that first night he has never once gone out of the house.\a148\a147Oh, he went out the first night, did he?\a148\a147Yes, sir, and returned very late\a151 after we were all in bed. He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door. I heard him come up the stair after midnight.\a148\a147But his meals?\a148\a147It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair, outside his door. Then he rings again when he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair. If he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.\a148\a147Prints it?\a148\a147Yes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word, nothing more. Here\a146s one I brought to show you\a151 SOAP. Here\a146s another\a151 MATCH. This is one he left the first morning\a151 DAILY GAZETTE. I leave that paper with his breakfast every morning.\a148\a147Dear me, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, \a147this is certainly a little unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but why print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it suggest, Watson?\a148\a147That he desired to conceal his handwriting.\a148\a147But why? What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word of his writing? Still, it may be as you say. Then, again, why such laconic messages?\a148\a147I cannot imagine.\a148\a147It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words are written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern. You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done, so that the s of \a145SOAP\a146 is partly gone. Suggestive, Watson, is it not?\a148\a147Of caution?\a148\a147Exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something which might give a clue to the person\a146s identity. Now, Mrs. Warren, you say that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. What age would he be?\a148\a147Youngish, sir\a151 not over thirty.\a148\a147Well, can you give me no further indications?\a148\a147He spoke good English, sir, and yet I thought he was a foreigner by his accent.\a148\a147And he was well dressed?\a148\a147Very smartly dressed, sir\a151 quite the gentleman. Dark clothes\a151 nothing you would note.\a148\a147He gave no name?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147And has had no letters or callers?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?\a148\a147No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.\a148\a147Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. What about his luggage?\a148\a147He had one big brown bag with him\a151 nothing else.\a148\a147Well, we don\a146t seem to have much material to help us. Do you say nothing has come out of that room\a151 absolutely nothing?\a148The landlady drew an envelope from her bag; from it she shook out two burnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.\a147They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had heard that you can read great things out of small ones.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147There is nothing here,\a148 said he. \a147The matches have, of course, been used to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of the but end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar. But, dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded and moustached, you say?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147I don\a146t understand that. I should say that only a clean-shaven man could have smoked this. Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would have been singed.\a148\a147A holder?\a148 I suggested.\a147No, no; the end is matted. I suppose there could not be two people in your rooms, Mrs. Warren?\a148\a147No, sir. He eats so little that I often wonder it can keep life in one.\a148\a147Well, I think we must wait for a little more material. After all, you have nothing to complain of. You have received your rent, and he is not a troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one. He pays you well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours. We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it. I\a146ve taken up the matter, and I won\a146t lose sight of it. Report to me if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should be needed.\a147There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,\a148 he remarked when the landlady had left us. \a147It may, of course, be trivial\a151 individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them.\a148\a147Why should you think so?\a148\a147Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms? He came back\a151 or someone came back\a151 when all witnesses were out of the way. We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out. Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English well. This other, however, prints \a145match\a146 when it should have been \a145matches.\a146 I can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural. The laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.\a148\a147But for what possible end?\a148\a147Ah! there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of investigation.\a148 He took down the great book in which, day by day, he filed the agony columns of the various London journals. \a147Dear me!\a148 said he, turning over the pages, \a147what a chorus of groans, cries, and bleatings! What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the \iDaily Gazette\i extracts of the last fortnight. \a145Lady with a black boa at Prince\a146s Skating Club\a146that we may pass. \a145Surely Jimmy will not break his mother\a146s heart\a146that appears to be irrelevant. \a145If the lady who fainted in the Brixton bus\a146she does not interest me. \a145Every day my heart longs\a151\a146 Bleat, Watson\a151 unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this: \a145Be patient. Will find some sure means of communication. Meanwhile, this column. G.\a146 That is two days after Mrs. Warren\a146s lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it not? The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are\a151 three days later. \a145Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.\a146 Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more definite: \a145The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed\a151 one A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.\a146 That was in yesterday\a146s paper, and there is nothing in to-day\a146s. It\a146s all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren\a146s lodger. If we wait a little, Watson, I don\a146t doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible.\a148So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face.\a147How\a146s this, Watson?\a148 he cried, picking up the paper from the table. \a147\a160\a145High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G.\a146 That is definite enough. I think after breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren\a146s neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?\a148Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told of some new and momentous development.\a147It\a146s a police matter, Mr. Holmes!\a148 she cried. \a147I\a146ll have no more of it! He shall pack out of there with his baggage. I would have gone straight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to take your opinion first. But I\a146m at the end of my patience, and when it comes to knocking my old man about \a148\a147Knocking Mr. Warren about?\a148\a147Using him roughly, anyway.\a148\a147But who used him roughly?\a148\a147Ah! that\a146s what we want to know! It was this morning, sir. Mr. Warren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight\a146s, in Tottenham Court Road. He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him, threw a coat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb. They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and shot him out. He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he was on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on the sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had happened.\a148\a147Most interesting,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Did he observe the appearance of these men\a151 did he hear them talk?\a148\a147No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe three.\a148\a147And you connect this attack with your lodger?\a148\a147Well, we\a146ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before. I\a146ve had enough of him. Money\a146s not everything. I\a146ll have him out of my house before the day is done.\a148\a147Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. I begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. It is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. It is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light. On discovering their mistake they released him. What they would have done had it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture.\a148\a147Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.\a148\a147I don\a146t see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door. I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the tray.\a148\a147He has to take the tray in. Surely we could conceal ourselves and see him do it.\a148The landlady thought for a moment.\a147Well, sir, there\a146s the box-room opposite. I could arrange a looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door\a151\a148\a147Excellent!\a148 said Holmes. \a147When does he lunch?\a148\a147About one, sir.\a148\a147Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs. Warren, good-bye.\a148At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren\a146s house\a151 a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme Street, a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of the street it commands a view down Howe Street, with its more pretentious houses. Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye.\a147See, Watson!\a148 said he. \a147\a160\a145High red house with stone facings.\a146 There is the signal station all right. We know the place, and we know the code; so surely our task should be simple. There\a146s a \a145to let\a146 card in that window. It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?\a148\a147I have it all ready for you. If you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing, I\a146ll put you there now.\a148It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged. The mirror was so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the door opposite. We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left us, when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung. Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed. Crouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady\a146s footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair. An instant later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful, horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the boxroom. Then the door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair.\a147I will call again in the evening,\a148 said he to the expectant landlady. \a147I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own quarters.\a148\a147My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,\a148 said he, speaking from the depths of his easy-chair. \a147There has been a substitution of lodgers. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no ordinary woman, Watson.\a148\a147She saw us.\a148\a147Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is certain. The general sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in London from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. It is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food. The printed messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the agony column of a paper. So far all is clear.\a148\a147But what is at the root of it?\a148\a147Ah, yes, Watson\a151 severely practical, as usual! What is at the root of it all? Mrs. Warren\a146s whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say: that it is no ordinary love escapade. You saw the woman\a146s face at the sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death. The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male. It is very curious and complex, Watson.\a148\a147Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?\a148\a147What, indeed? It is art for art\a146s sake, Watson. I suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?\a148\a147For my education, Holmes.\a148\a147Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither money nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation.\a148When we returned to Mrs. Warren\a146s rooms, the gloom of a London winter evening had thickened into one grey curtain, a dead monotone of colour, broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of the lodginghouse, one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity.\a147Someone is moving in that room,\a148 said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. \a147Yes, I can see his shadow. There he is again! He has a candle in his hand. Now he is peering across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. Now he begins to flash. Take the message also, Watson, that we may check each other. A single flash\a151 that is A, surely. Now, then. How many did you make it? Twenty. So did I. That should mean T. AT\a151 that\a146s intelligible enough! Another T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word. Now, then\a151 TENTA. Dead stop. That can\a146t be all, Watson? ATTENTA gives no sense. Nor is it any better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A. are a person\a146s initials. There it goes again! What\a146s that? ATTE why, it is the same message over again. Curious, Watson, very curious! Now he is off once more! AT\a151 why, he is repeating it for the third time. ATTENTA three times! How often will he repeat it? No, that seems to be the finish. He has withdrawn from the window. What do you make of it, Watson?\a148\a147A cipher message, Holmes.\a148My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension.\a147And not a very obscure cipher, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Why, of course, it is Italian! The A means that it is addressed to a woman. \a145Beware! Beware! Beware!\a146 How\a146s that, Watson?\a148\a147I believe you have hit it.\a148\a147Not a doubt of it. It is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to make it more so. But beware of what? Wait a bit; he is coming to the window once more.\a148Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came more rapidly than before\a151 so rapid that it was hard to follow them.\a147PERICOLO pericolo\a151 eh, what\a146s that, Watson? \a145Danger,\a146 isn\a146t it? Yes, by Jove, it\a146s a danger signal. There he goes again! PERI. Halloa, what on earth\a151\a148The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty building, with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry had been suddenly cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought occurred on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from where he crouched by the window.\a147This is serious, Watson,\a148 he cried. \a147There is some devilry going forward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should put Scotland Yard in touch with this business\a151 and yet, it is too pressing for us to leave.\a148\a147Shall I go for the police?\a148\a147We must define the situation a little more clearly. It may bear some more innocent interpretation. Come. Watson, let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it.\a148As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building which we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see the shadow of a head, a woman\a146s head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the railing. He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.\a147Holmes!\a148 he cried.\a147Why, Gregson!\a148 said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland Yard detective. \a147Journeys end with lovers\a146 meetings. What brings you here?\a148\a147The same reasons that bring you, I expect,\a148 said Gregson. \a147How you got on to it I can\a146t imagine.\a148\a147Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle. I\a146ve been taking the signals.\a148\a147Signals?\a148\a147Yes, from that window. They broke off in the middle. We came over to see the reason. But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in continuing the business.\a148\a147Wait a bit!\a148 cried Gregson eagerly. \a147I\a146ll do you this justice, Mr. Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn\a146t feel stronger for having you on my side. There\a146s only the one exit to these flats, so we have him safe.\a148\a147Who is he?\a148\a147Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us best this time.\a148 He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which a cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a four-wheeler which stood on the far side of the street. \a147May I introduce you to Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\a148 he said to the cabman. \a147This is Mr. Leverton, of Pinkerton\a146s American Agency.\a148\a147The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?\a148 said Holmes. \a147Sir, I am pleased to meet you.\a148The American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven, hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. \a147I am on the trail of my life now, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147If I can get Gorgiano\a151\a148\a147What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?\a148\a147Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well, we\a146ve learned all about him in America. We \iknow\i he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on. I tracked him over from New York, and I\a146ve been close to him for a week in London, waiting some excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him to ground in that big tenement house, and there\a146s only the one door, so he can\a146t slip us. There\a146s three folk come out since he went in, but I\a146ll swear he wasn\a146t one of them.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes talks of signals,\a148 said Gregson. \a147I expect, as usual, he knows a good deal that we don\a146t.\a148In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us.The American struck his hands together with vexation.\a147He\a146s on to us!\a148 he cried.\a147Why do you think so?\a148\a147Well, it figures out that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out messages to an accomplice\a151 there are several of his gang in London. Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it? What do you suggest, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147That we go up at once and see for ourselves.\a148\a147But we have no warrant for his arrest.\a148\a147He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,\a148 said Gregson. \a147That is good enough for the moment. When we have him by the heels we can see if New York can\a146t help us to keep him. I\a146ll take the responsibility of arresting him now.\a148Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. London dangers were the privilege of the London force.The door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing ajar. Gregson pushed it open. Within all was absolute silence and darkness. I struck a match and lit the detective\a146s lantern. As I did so, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of surprise. On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood. The red steps pointed towards us and led away from an inner room, the door of which was closed. Gregson flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him, while we all peered eagerly over his shoulders.In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a knife driven blade-deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow. Beside his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.\a147By George! it\a146s Black Gorgiano himself!\a148 cried the American detective. \a147Someone has got ahead of us this time.\a148\a147Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Gregson. \a147Why, whatever are you doing?\a148Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it backward and forward across the window-panes. Then he peered into the darkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.\a147I rather think that will be helpful,\a148 said he. He came over and stood in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body. \a147You say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting downstairs,\a148 said he at last. \a147Did you observe them closely?\a148\a147Yes, I did.\a148\a147Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?\a148\a147Yes; he was the last to pass me.\a148\a147That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his description, and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough for you.\a148\a147Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London.\a148\a147Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to your aid.\a148We all turned round at the words. There, framed in the doorway, was a tall and beautiful woman\a151 the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury. Slowly she advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor.\a147You have killed him!\a148 she muttered. \a147Oh, \iDio mio\i, you have killed him!\a148 Then I heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang into the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the room she danced, her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a thousand pretty Italian exclamations pouring from her lips. It was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare.\a147But you! You are police, are you not? You have killed Giuseppe Gorgiano. Is it not so?\a148\a147We are police, madam.\a148She looked round into the shadows of the room.\a147But where, then, is Gennaro?\a148 she asked. \a147He is my husband, Gennaro Lucca. I am Emilia Lucca, and we are both from New York. Where is Gennaro? He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with all my speed.\a148\a147It was I who called,\a148 said Holmes.\a147You! How could you call?\a148\a147Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your presence here was desirable. I knew that I had only to flash \a145\iVieni\i\a146 and you would surely come.\a148The beautiful Italian looked with awe at my companion.\a147I do not understand how you know these things,\a148 she said. \a147Giuseppe Gorgiano\a151 how did he\a151\a148 She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight. \a147Now I see it! My Gennaro! My splendid, beautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it, with his own strong hand he killed the monster! Oh, Gennaro, how wonderful you are! What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?\a148\a147Well, Mrs. Lucca,\a148 said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the lady\a146s sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a Notting Hill hooligan, \a147I am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but you\a146ve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard.\a148\a147One moment, Gregson,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us? What you say may be used in evidence. But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the whole story.\a148\a147Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,\a148 said the lady. \a147He was a devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him.\a148\a147In that case,\a148 said Holmes, \a147my suggestion is that we lock this door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.\a148Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room of Signora Lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness. She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for the sake of clearness, I will make grammatical.\a147I was born in Posilippo, near Naples,\a148 said she, \a147and was the daughter of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that part. Gennaro was in my father\a146s employment, and I came to love him, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position\a151 nothing but his beauty and strength and energy\a151 so my father forbade the match. We fled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to America. This was four years ago, and we have been in New York ever since.\a147Fortune was very good to us at first. Gennaro was able to do a service to an Italian gentleman\a151 he saved him from some ruffians in the place called the Bowery and so made a powerful friend. His name was Tito Castalotte and he was the senior partner of the great firm of Castalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of New York. Signor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power within the firm, which employs more than three hundred men. He took my husband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed his good-will towards him in every way. Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and I believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my husband and I loved him as if he were our father. We had taken and furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed assured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky.\a147One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a fellow-countryman back with him. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come also from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you can testify, for you have looked upon his corpse. Not only was his body that of a giant but everything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying. His voice was like thunder in our little house. There was scarce room for the whirl of his great arms as he talked. His thoughts, his emotions, his passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous. He talked, or rather roared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed with the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy. He was a terrible and wonderful man. I thank God that he is dead!\a147He came again and again. Yet I was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than I was in his presence. My poor husband would sit pale and listless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which made up our visitor\a146s conversation. Gennaro said nothing, but I, who knew him so well, could read in his face some emotion which I had never seen there before. At first I thought that it was dislike. And then, gradually, I understood that it was more than dislike. It was fear\a151 a deep, secret, shrinking fear. That night\a151 the night that I read his terror\a151 I put my arms round him and I implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so.\a147He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as I listened. My poor Gennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had joined a Neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible. When we had fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off forever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the very man who had initiated him in Naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who had earned the name of \a145Death\a146 in the south of Italy, for he was red to the elbow in murder! He had come to New York to avoid the Italian police, and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home. All this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that his presence at it was required and ordered.\a147That was bad enough, but worse was to come. I had noticed for some time that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the evening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my husband those terrible, glaring, wild-beast eyes of his were always turned upon me. One night his secret came out. I had awakened what he called \a145love\a146 within him\a151 the love of a brute\a151 a savage. Gennaro had not yet returned when he came. He pushed his way in, seized me in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear\a146s embrace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to come away with him. I was struggling and screaming when Gennaro entered and attacked him. He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter. It was a deadly enemy that we made that night.\a147A few days later came the meeting. Gennaro returned from it with a face which told me that something dreadful had occurred. It was worse than we could have imagined possible. The funds of the society were raised by blackmailing rich Italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money. It seems that Castalotte, our dear friend and benefactor, had been approached. He had refused to yield to threats, and he had handed the notices to the police. It was resolved now that such an example should be made of him as would prevent any other victim from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite. There was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out the deed. Gennaro saw our enemy\a146s cruel face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. No doubt it had been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his palm. He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his comrades. It was part of their fiendish system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only their own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro\a146s head and drove him nearly crazy with apprehension.\a147All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my husband and I were on our way to London, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of his danger, and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future.\a147The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. We were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows. Gorgiano had his private reasons for vengeance, but in any case we knew how ruthless, cunning, and untiring he could be. Both Italy and America are full of stories of his dreadful powers. If ever they were exerted it would be now. My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the American and with the Italian police. I do not myself know where he lived, or how. All that I learned was through the columns of a newspaper. But once as I looked through my window, I saw two Italians watching the house, and I understood that in some way Gorgiano had found out our retreat. Finally Gennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a certain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings, which were suddenly interrupted. It is very clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God, he was ready for him when he came. And now, gentlemen, I would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my Gennaro for what he has done?\a148\a147Well, Mr. Gregson,\a148 said the American, looking across at the official, \a147I don\a146t know what your British point of view may be, but I guess that in New York this lady\a146s husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks.\a148\a147She will have to come with me and see the chief,\a148 Gregson answered. \a147If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband has much to fear. But what I can\a146t make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes, is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter.\a148\a147Education, Gregson, education. Still seeking knowledge at the old university. Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and grotesque to add to your collection. By the way, it is not eight o\a146clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! If we hurry, we might be in time for the second act.\a148\p\X1\BThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\B\X1\c\i\m="lady-03.png"\i\c\a147But why Turkish?\a148 asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my boots. I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my protruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.\a147English,\a148 I answered in some surprise. \a147I got them at Latimer\a146s, in Oxford Street.\a148Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience.\a147The bath!\a148 he said; \a147the bath! Why the relaxing and expensive Turkish rather than the invigorating home-made article?\a148\a147Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old. A Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine\a151 a fresh starting-point, a cleanser of the system.\a147By the way, Holmes,\a148 I added, \a147I have no doubt the connection between my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one to a logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would indicate it.\a148\a147The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson,\a148 said Holmes with a mischievous twinkle. \a147It belongs to the same elementary class of deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who shared your cab in your drive this morning.\a148\a147I don\a146t admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation,\a148 said I with some asperity.\a147Bravo, Watson! A very dignified and logical remonstrance. Let me see, what were the points? Take the last one first\a151 the cab. You observe that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat. Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes, and if you had they would certainly have been symmetrical. Therefore it is clear that you sat at the side. Therefore it is equally clear that you had a companion.\a148\a147That is very evident.\a148\a147Absurdly commonplace, is it not?\a148\a147But the boots and the bath?\a148\a147Equally childish. You are in the habit of doing up your boots in a certain way. I see them on this occasion fastened with an elaborate double bow, which is not your usual method of tying them. You have, therefore, had them off. Who has tied them? A bootmaker\a151 or the boy at the bath. It is unlikely that it is the bootmaker, since your boots are nearly new. Well, what remains? The bath. Absurd, is it not? But, for all that, the Turkish bath has served a purpose.\a148\a147What is that?\a148\a147You say that you have had it because you need a change. Let me suggest that you take one. How would Lausanne do, my dear Watson\a151 first-class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely scale?\a148\a147Splendid! But why?\a148Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his pocket.\a147One of the most dangerous classes in the world,\a148 said he, \a147is the drifting and friendless woman. She is the most harmless and often the most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in others. She is helpless. She is migratory. She has sufficient means to take her from country to country and from hotel to hotel. She is lost, as often as not, in a maze of obscure \ipensions\i and boarding-houses. She is a stray chicken in a world of foxes. When she is gobbled up she is hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has come to the Lady Frances Carfax.\a148I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the particular. Holmes consulted his notes.\a147Lady Frances,\a148 he continued, \a147is the sole survivor of the direct family of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may remember, in the male line. She was left with limited means, but with some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously cut diamonds to which she was fondly attached\a151 too attached, for she refused to leave them with her banker and always carried them about with her. A rather pathetic figure, the Lady Frances, a beautiful woman, still in fresh middle age, and yet, by a strange chance, the last derelict of what only twenty years ago was a goodly fleet.\a148\a147What has happened to her, then?\a148\a147Ah, what has happened to the Lady Frances? Is she alive or dead? There is our problem. She is a lady of precise habits, and for four years it has been her invariable custom to write every second week to Miss Dobney, her old governess, who has long retired and lives in Camberwell. It is this Miss Dobney who has consulted me. Nearly five weeks have passed without a word. The last letter was from the Hotel National at Lausanne. Lady Frances seems to have left there and given no address. The family are anxious, and as they are exceedingly wealthy no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up.\a148\a147Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? Surely she had other correspondents?\a148\a147There is one correspondent who is a sure draw, Watson. That is the bank. Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed diaries. She banks at Silvester\a146s. I have glanced over her account. The last cheque but one paid her bill at Lausanne but it was a large one and probably left her with cash in hand. Only one cheque has been drawn since.\a148\a147To whom, and where?\a148\a147To Miss Marie Devine. There is nothing to show where the cheque was drawn. It was cashed at the Cr\a233dit Lyonnais at Montpellier less than three weeks ago. The sum was fifty pounds.\a148\a147And who is Miss Marie Devine?\a148\a147That also I have been able to discover. Miss Marie Devine was the maid of Lady Frances Carfax. Why she should have paid her this cheque we have not yet determined. I have no doubt, however, that your researches will soon clear the matter up.\a148\a147\iMy\i researches!\a148\a147Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. You know that I cannot possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal terror of his life. Besides, on general principles it is best that I should not leave the country. Scotland Yard feels lonely without me, and it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes. Go, then, my dear Watson, and if my humble counsel can ever be valued at so extravagant a rate as two pence a word, it waits your disposal night and day at the end of the Continental wire.\a148Two days later found me at the Hotel National at Lausanne, where I received every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known manager. Lady Frances, as he informed me, had stayed there for several weeks. She had been much liked by all who met her. Her age was not more than forty. She was still handsome and bore every sign of having in her youth been a very lovely woman. M. Moser knew nothing of any valuable jewellery, but it had been remarked by the servants that the heavy trunk in the lady\a146s bedroom was always scrupulously locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her mistress. She was actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the hotel, and there was no difficulty in getting her address. It was 11 Rue de Trajan, \iMontpellier\i. All this I jotted down and felt that Holmes himself could not have been more adroit in collecting his facts.Only one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I possessed could clear up the cause for the lady\a146s sudden departure. She was very happy at Lausanne. There was every reason to believe that she intended to remain for the season in her luxurious rooms overlooking the lake. And yet she had left at a single day\a146s notice, which involved her in the useless payment of a week\a146s rent. Only Jules Vibart, the lover of the maid, had any suggestion to offer. He connected the sudden departure with the visit to the hotel a day or two before of a tall, dark, bearded man. \a147\iUn sauvage\a151 un veritable sauvage!\i\a148 cried Jules Vibart. The man had rooms somewhere in the town. He had been seen talking earnestly to Madame on the promenade by the lake. Then he had called. She had refused to see him. He was English, but of his name there was no record. Madame had left the place immediately afterwards. Jules Vibart, and, what was of more importance, Jules Vibart\a146s sweetheart, thought that this call and this departure were cause and effect. Only one thing Jules would not discuss. That was the reason why Marie had left her mistress. Of that he could or would say nothing. If I wished to know, I must go to Montpellier and ask her.So ended the first chapter of my inquiry. The second was devoted to the place which Lady Frances Carfax had sought when she left Lausanne. Concerning this there had been some secrecy, which confirmed the idea that she had gone with the intention of throwing someone off her track. Otherwise why should not her luggage have been openly labelled for Baden? Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by some circuitous route. This much I gathered from the manager of Cook\a146s local office. So to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes an account of all my proceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of half-humorous commendation.At Baden the track was not difficult to follow. Lady Frances had stayed at the Englischer Hof for a fortnight. While there she had made the acquaintance of a Dr. Shlessinger and his wife, a missionary from South America. Like most lonely ladies, Lady Frances found her comfort and occupation in religion. Dr. Shlessinger\a146s remarkable personality, his whole-hearted devotion, and the fact that he was recovering from a disease contracted in the exercise of his apostolic duties affected her deeply. She had helped Mrs. Shlessinger in the nursing of the convalescent saint. He spent his day, as the manager described it to me, upon a lounge-chair on the veranda, with an attendant lady upon either side of him. He was preparing a map of the Holy Land, with special reference to the kingdom of the Midianites, upon which he was writing a monograph. Finally, having improved much in health, he and his wife had returned to London, and Lady Frances had started thither in their company. This was just three weeks before, and the manager had heard nothing since. As to the maid, Marie, she had gone off some days beforehand in floods of tears, after informing the other maids that she was leaving service forever. Dr. Shlessinger had paid the bill of the whole party before his departure.\a147By the way,\a148 said the landlord in conclusion, \a147you are not the only friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only a week or so ago we had a man here upon the same errand.\a148\a147Did he give a name?\a148 I asked.\a147None; but he was an Englishman, though of an unusual type.\a148\a147A savage?\a148 said I, linking my facts after the fashion of my illustrious friend.\a147Exactly. That describes him very well. He is a bulky, bearded, sunburned fellow, who looks as if he would be more at home in a farmers\a146 inn than in a fashionable hotel. A hard, fierce man, I should think, and one whom I should be sorry to offend.\a148Already the mystery began to define itself, as figures grow clearer with the lifting of a fog. Here was this good and pious lady pursued from place to place by a sinister and unrelenting figure. She feared him, or she would not have fled from Lausanne. He had still followed. Sooner or later he would overtake her. Had he already overtaken her? Was that the secret of her continued silence? Could the good people who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this long pursuit? There was the problem which I had to solve.To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to the roots of the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a description of Dr. Shlessinger\a146s left ear. Holmes\a146s ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest\a151 indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.I had no difficulty in finding the ex-servant and in learning all that she could tell me. She was a devoted creature, who had only left her mistress because she was sure that she was in good hands, and because her own approaching marriage made a separation inevitable in any case. Her mistress had, as she confessed with distress, shown some irritability of temper towards her during their stay in Baden, and had even questioned her once as if she had suspicions of her honesty, and this had made the parting easier than it would otherwise have been. Lady Frances had given her fifty pounds as a wedding-present. Like me, Marie viewed with deep distrust the stranger who had driven her mistress from Lausanne. With her own eyes she had seen him seize the lady\a146s wrist with great violence on the public promenade by the lake. He was a fierce and terrible man. She believed that it was out of dread of him that Lady Frances had accepted the escort of the Shlessingers to London. She had never spoken to Marie about it, but many little signs had convinced the maid that her mistress lived in a state of continual nervous apprehension. So far she had got in her narrative, when suddenly she sprang from her chair and her face was convulsed with surprise and fear. \a147See!\a148 she cried. \a147The miscreant follows still! There is the very man of whom I speak.\a148Through the open sitting-room window I saw a huge, swarthy man with a bristling black beard walking slowly down the centre of the street and staring eagerly at the numbers of the houses. It was clear that, like myself, he was on the track of the maid. Acting upon the impulse of the moment, I rushed out and accosted him.\a147You are an Englishman,\a148 I said.\a147What if I am?\a148 he asked with a most villainous scowl.\a147May I ask what your name is?\a148\a147No, you may not,\a148 said he with decision.The situation was awkward, but the most direct way is often the best.\a147Where is the Lady Frances Carfax?\a148 I asked.He stared at me in amazement.\a147What have you done with her? Why have you pursued her? I insist upon an answer!\a148 said I.The fellow gave a bellow of anger and sprang upon me like a tiger. I have held my own in many a struggle, but the man had a grip of iron and the fury of a fiend. His hand was on my throat and my senses were nearly gone before an unshaven French \iouvrier\i in a blue blouse darted out from a \icabaret\i opposite, with a cudgel in his hand, and struck my assailant a sharp crack over the forearm, which made him leave go his hold. He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left me and entered the cottage from which I had just come. I turned to thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147a very pretty hash you have made of it! I rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night express.\a148An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was seated in my private room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next obvious point of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the \icabaret\i waiting for my appearance.\a147And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear Watson,\a148 said he. \a147I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder which you have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding has been to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing.\a148\a147Perhaps you would have done no better,\a148 I answered bitterly.\a147There is no \a145perhaps\a146 about it. I \ihave\i done better. Here is the Hon. Philip Green, who is a fellow-lodger with you in this hotel, and we may find him the starting-point for a more successful investigation.\a148A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street. He started when he saw me.\a147What is this, Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked. \a147I had your note and I have come. But what has this man to do with the matter?\a148\a147This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us in this affair.\a148The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of apology.\a147I hope I didn\a146t harm you. When you accused me of hurting her I lost my grip of myself. Indeed, I\a146m not responsible in these days. My nerves are like live wires. But this situation is beyond me. What I want to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world you came to hear of my existence at all.\a148\a147I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances\a146s governess.\a148\a147Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I remember her well.\a148\a147And she remembers you. It was in the days before\a151 before you found it better to go to South Africa.\a148\a147Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need hide nothing from you. I swear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man who loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for Frances. I was a wild youngster, I know\a151 not worse than others of my class. But her mind was pure as snow. She could not bear a shadow of coarseness. So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she would have no more to say to me. And yet she loved me\a151 that is the wonder of it!\a151 loved me well enough to remain single all her sainted days just for my sake alone. When the years had passed and I had made my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried. I found her at Lausanne and tried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her will was strong, and when next I called she had left the town. I traced her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I\a146m a rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to me as he did I lost hold of myself for a moment. But for God\a146s sake tell me what has become of the Lady Frances.\a148\a147That is for us to find out,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar gravity. \a147What is your London address, Mr. Green?\a148\a147The Langham Hotel will find me.\a148\a147Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I should want you? I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the safety of Lady Frances. I can say no more for the instant. I will leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us. Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7:30 to-morrow.\a148A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms, which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to me. \a147Jagged or torn,\a148 was the message, and the place of origin, Baden.\a147What is this?\a148 I asked.\a147It is everything,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147You may remember my seemingly irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman\a146s left ear. You did not answer it.\a148\a147I had left Baden and could not inquire.\a148\a147Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here.\a148\a147What does it show?\a148\a147It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally astute and dangerous man. The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from South America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved\a151 and for a young country it has turned out some very finished types. His particular specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named Fraser, is a worthy helpmate. The nature of his tactics suggested his identity to me, and this physical peculiarity\a151 he was badly bitten in a saloon-fight at Adelaide in \a14689\a151 confirmed my suspicion. This poor lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at nothing, Watson. That she is already dead is a very likely supposition. If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends. It is always possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the Continental police; and the latter is also unlikely, as these rogues could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to keep a person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is in London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard.\a148But neither the official police nor Holmes\a146s own small but very efficient organisation sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements were tried, and failed. Clues were followed, and led to nothing. Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in vain. His old associates were watched but they kept clear of him. And then suddenly, after a week of helpless suspense, there came a flash of light. A silver-and-brilliant pendant of old Spanish design had been pawned at Bovington\a146s, in Westminster Road. The pawner was a large clean-shaven man of clerical appearance. His name and address were demonstrably false. The ear had escaped notice, but the description was surely that of Shlessinger.Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for news\a151 the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His clothes were getting looser on his great body. He seemed to be wilting away in his anxiety. \a147If you will only give me something to do!\a148 was his constant wail. At last Holmes could oblige him.\a147He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now.\a148\a147But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?\a148Holmes shook his head very gravely.\a147Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction. We must prepare for the worst.\a148\a147What can I do?\a148\a147These people do not know you by sight?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147It is possible that he will go to some other pawnbroker in the future. In that case, we must begin again. On the other hand, he has had a fair price and no questions asked, so if he is in need of ready-money he will probably come back to Bovington\a146s. I will give you a note to them, and they will let you wait in the shop. If the fellow comes you will follow him home. But no indiscretion and, above all, no violence. I put you on your honour that you will take no step without my knowledge and consent.\a148For two days the Hon. Philip Green (he was, I may mention the son of the famous admiral of that name who commanded the Sea of Azof fleet in the Crimean War) brought us no news. On the evening of the third he rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle of his powerful frame quivering with excitement.\a147We have him! We have him!\a148 he cried.He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few words and thrust him into an armchair.\a147Come, now, give us the order of events,\a148 said he.\a147She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the pendant she brought was the fellow of the other. She is a tall, pale woman, with ferret eyes.\a148\a147That is the lady,\a148 said Holmes.\a147She left the office and I followed her. She walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr. Holmes, it was an undertaker\a146s.\a148My companion started. \a147Well?\a148 he asked in that vibrant voice which told of the fiery soul behind the cold grey face.\a147She was talking to the woman behind the counter. I entered as well. \a145It is late,\a146 I heard her say, or words to that effect. The woman was excusing herself. \a145It should be there before now,\a146 she answered. \a145It took longer, being out of the ordinary.\a146 They both stopped and looked at me, so I asked some question and then left the shop.\a148\a147You did excellently well. What happened next?\a148\a147The woman came out, but I had hid myself in a doorway. Her suspicions had been aroused, I think, for she looked round her. Then she called a cab and got in. I was lucky enough to get another and so to follow her. She got down at last at No. 36 Poultney Square, Brixton. I drove past, left my cab at the corner of the square, and watched the house.\a148\a147Did you see anyone?\a148\a147The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The blind was down, and I could not see in. I was standing there, wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two men in it. They descended, took something out of the van, and carried it up the steps to the hall door. Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin.\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she recognised me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am.\a148\a147You have done excellent work,\a148 said Holmes, scribbling a few words upon a half-sheet of paper. \a147We can do nothing legal without a warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to the authorities and getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient. Lestrade will see to all details.\a148\a147But they may murder her in the meanwhile. What could the coffin mean, and for whom could it be but for her?\a148\a147We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be lost. Leave it in our hands. Now, Watson,\a148 he added as our client hurried away, \a147he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. The situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures are justified. Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney Square.\a147Let us try to reconstruct the situation,\a148 said he as we drove swiftly past the Houses of Parliament and over Westminster Bridge. \a147These villains have coaxed this unhappy lady to London, after first alienating her from her faithful maid. If she has written any letters they have been intercepted. Through some confederate they have engaged a furnished house. Once inside it, they have made her a prisoner, and they have become possessed of the valuable jewellery which has been their object from the first. Already they have begun to sell part of it, which seems safe enough to them, since they have no reason to think that anyone is interested in the lady\a146s fate. When she is released she will, of course, denounce them. Therefore, she must not be released. But they cannot keep her under lock and key forever. So murder is their only solution.\a148\a147That seems very clear.\a148\a147Now we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of intersection which should approximate to the truth. We will start now, not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward. That incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead. It points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of medical certificate and official sanction. Had the lady been obviously murdered, they would have buried her in a hole in the back garden. But here all is open and regular. What does that mean? Surely that they have done her to death in some way which has deceived the doctor and simulated a natural end\a151 poisoning, perhaps. And yet how strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he were a confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition.\a148\a147Could they have forged a medical certificate?\a148\a147Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I hardly see them doing that. Pull up, cabby! This is evidently the undertaker\a146s, for we have just passed the pawnbroker\a146s. Would you go in, Watson? Your appearance inspires confidence. Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes place to-morrow.\a148The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to be at eight o\a146clock in the morning. \a147You see, Watson, no mystery; everything above board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear. Well, there\a146s nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?\a148\a147My stick!\a148\a147Well, well, we shall be strong enough. \a145Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just.\a146 We simply can\a146t afford to wait for the police or to keep within the four corners of the law. You can drive off, cabby. Now, Watson, we\a146ll just take our luck together, as we have occasionally done in the past.\a148He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of Poultney Square. It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.\a147Well, what do you want?\a148 she asked sharply, peering at us through the darkness.\a147I want to speak to Dr. Shlessinger,\a148 said Holmes.\a147There is no such person here,\a148 she answered, and tried to close the door, but Holmes had jammed it with his foot.\a147Well, I want to see the man who lives here, whatever he may call himself,\a148 said Holmes firmly.She hesitated. Then she threw open the door. \a147Well, come in!\a148 said she. \a147My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world.\a148 She closed the door behind us and showed us into a sitting-room on the right side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us. \a147Mr. Peters will be with you in an instant,\a148 she said.Her words were literally true, for we had hardly time to look around the dusty and moth-eaten apartment in which we found ourselves before the door opened and a big, clean-shaven bald-headed man stepped lightly into the room. He had a large red face, with pendulous cheeks, and a general air of superficial benevolence which was marred by a cruel, vicious mouth.\a147There is surely some mistake here, gentlemen,\a148 he said in an unctuous, make-everything-easy voice. \a147I fancy that you have been misdirected. Possibly if you tried farther down the street\a151\a148\a147That will do; we have no time to waste,\a148 said my companion firmly. \a147You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of Baden and South America. I am as sure of that as that my own name is Sherlock Holmes.\a148Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his formidable pursuer. \a147I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he coolly. \a147When a man\a146s conscience is easy you can\a146t rattle him. What is your business in my house?\a148\a147I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom you brought away with you from Baden.\a148\a147I\a146d be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,\a148 Peters answered coolly. \a147I\a146ve a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden\a151 it is a fact that I was using another name at the time\a151 and she stuck on to us until we came to London. I paid her bill and her ticket. Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills. You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I\a146m your debtor.\a148\a147I \imean\i to find her,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147I\a146m going through this house till I do find her.\a148\a147Where is your warrant?\a148Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket. \a147This will have to serve till a better one comes.\a148\a147Why, you are a common burglar.\a148\a147So you might describe me,\a148 said Holmes cheerfully. \a147My companion is also a dangerous ruffian. And together we are going through your house.\a148Our opponent opened the door.\a147Fetch a policeman, Annie!\a148 said he. There was a whisk of feminine skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.\a147Our time is limited, Watson,\a148 said Holmes. \a147If you try to stop us, Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which was brought into your house?\a148\a147What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in it.\a148\a147I must see that body.\a148\a147Never with my consent.\a148\a147Then without it.\a148 With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to one side and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately before us. We entered. It was the dining-room. On the table, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes\a146s face showed his amazement, and also his relief.\a147Thank God!\a148 he muttered. \a147It\a146s someone else.\a148\a147Ah, you\a146ve blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said Peters, who had followed us into the room.\a147Who is this dead woman?\a148\a147Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife\a146s, Rose Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank Villas\a151 mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes\a151 and had her carefully tended, as Christian folk should. On the third day she died\a151 certificate says senile decay\a151 but that\a146s only the doctor\a146s opinion, and of course you know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o\a146clock tomorrow morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You\a146ve made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I\a146d give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety.\a148Holmes\a146s expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.\a147I am going through your house,\a148 said he.\a147Are you, though!\a148 cried Peters as a woman\a146s voice and heavy steps sounded in the passage. \a147We\a146ll soon see about that. This way, officers, if you please. These men have forced their way into my house, and I cannot get rid of them. Help me to put them out.\a148A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card from his case.\a147This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson.\a148\a147Bless you, sir, we know you very well,\a148 said the sergeant, \a147but you can\a146t stay here without a warrant.\a148\a147Of course not. I quite understand that.\a148\a147Arrest him!\a148 cried Peters.\a147We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,\a148 said the sergeant majestically, \a147but you\a146ll have to go, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.\a148A minute later we were in the street once more. Holmes was as cool as ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation. The sergeant had followed us.\a147Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that\a146s the law.\a148\a147Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.\a148\a147I expect there was good reason for your presence there. If there is anything I can do\a151\a148\a147It\a146s a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house. I expect a warrant presently.\a148\a147Then I\a146ll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes. If anything comes along, I will surely let you know.\a148It was only nine o\a146clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at once. First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found that it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called-some days before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former servant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with them. No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.The doctor was our next goal. He had been called in, had found the woman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had signed the certificate in due form. \a147I assure you that everything was perfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,\a148 said he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that for people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no servant. So far and no farther went the doctor.Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been difficulties of procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was inevitable. The magistrate\a146s signature might not be obtained until next morning. If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted upon. So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. We could but pray for patience and wait for the morrow.Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for sleep. I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the mystery. Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling about the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning, he rushed into my room. He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale, hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.\a147What time was the funeral? Eight, was it not?\a148 he asked eagerly. \a147Well, it is 7:20 now. Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any brains that God has given me? Quick, man, quick! It\a146s life or death\a151 a hundred chances on death to one on life. I\a146ll never forgive myself, never, if we are too late!\a148Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down Baker Street. But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big Ben, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road. But others were late as well as we. Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was still standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse came to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the threshold. Holmes darted forward and barred their way.\a147Take it back!\a148 he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the foremost. \a147Take it back this instant!\a148\a147What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your warrant?\a148 shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the farther end of the coffin.\a147The warrant is on its way. This coffin shall remain in the house until it comes.\a148The authority in Holmes\a146s voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders. \a147Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!\a148 he shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. \a147Here\a146s one for you, my man! A sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no questions\a151 work away! That\a146s good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It\a146s giving! It\a146s giving! Ah, that does it at last.\a148With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there came from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. A body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been soaked in the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a sitting position.\a147Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too late!\a148For half an hour it seemed that we were. What with actual suffocation, and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with artificial respiration, with injected ether, with every device that science could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life. A cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it. \a147Here is Lestrade with his warrant,\a148 said he. \a147He will find that his birds have flown. And here,\a148 he added as a heavy step hurried along the passage, \a147is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have. Good morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone.\a148\a147Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,\a148 said Holmes that evening, \a147it can only be as an example of that temporary eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed. Such slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognise and repair them. To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim. My night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange sentence, a curious observation, had come under my notice and had been too easily dismissed. Then, suddenly, in the grey of the morning, the words came back to me. It was the remark of the undertaker\a146s wife, as reported by Philip Green. She had said, \a145It should be there before now. It took longer, being out of the ordinary.\a146 It was the coffin of which she spoke. It had been out of the ordinary. That could only mean that it had been made to some special measurement. But why? Why? Then in an instant I remembered the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom. Why so large a coffin for so small a body? To leave room for another body. Both would be buried under the one certificate. It had all been so clear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed. At eight the Lady Frances would be buried. Our one chance was to stop the coffin before it left the house.\a147It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it \iwas\i a chance, as the result showed. These people had never, to my knowledge, done a murder. They might shrink from actual violence at the last. They could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she were exhumed there was a chance for them. I hoped that such considerations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene well enough. You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had been kept so long. They rushed in and overpowered her with their chloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure against her waking, and then screwed down the lid. A clever device, Watson. It is new to me in the annals of crime. If our ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some brilliant incidents in their future career.\a148\p\X1\BThe Dying Detective\B\X1\c\i\m="dyin-51.png"\i\cMrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes, was a long-suffering woman. Not only was her first-floor flat invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible untidiness, his addiction to music at strange hours, his occasional revolver practice within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him made him the very worst tenant in London. On the other hand, his payments were princely. I have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his rooms during the years that I was with him.The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his proceedings might seem. She was fond of him, too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent. Knowing how genuine was her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced.\a147He\a146s dying, Dr. Watson,\a148 said she. \a147For three days he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. \a145With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,\a146 said I. \a145Let it be Watson, then,\a146 said he. I wouldn\a146t waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive.\a148I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not say that I rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the details.\a147There is little I can tell you, sir. He has been working at a case down at Rotherhithe, in an alley near the river, and he has brought this illness back with him. He took to his bed on Wednesday afternoon and has never moved since. For these three days neither food nor drink has passed his lips.\a148\a147Good God! Why did you not call in a doctor?\a148\a147He wouldn\a146t have it, sir. You know how masterful he is. I didn\a146t dare to disobey him. But he\a146s not long for this world, as you\a146ll see for yourself the moment that you set eyes on him.\a148He was indeed a deplorable spectacle. In the dim light of a foggy November day the sick room was a gloomy spot, but it was that gaunt, wasted face staring at me from the bed which sent a chill to my heart. His eyes had the brightness of fever, there was a hectic flush upon either cheek, and dark crusts clung to his lips; the thin hands upon the coverlet twitched incessantly, his voice was croaking and spasmodic. He lay listlessly as I entered the room, but the sight of me brought a gleam of recognition to his eyes.\a147Well, Watson, we seem to have fallen upon evil days,\a148 said he in a feeble voice, but with something of his old carelessness of manner.\a147My dear fellow!\a148 I cried, approaching him.\a147Stand back! Stand right back!\a148 said he with the sharp imperiousness which I had associated only with moments of crisis. \a147If you approach me, Watson, I shall order you out of the house.\a148\a147But why?\a148\a147Because it is my desire. Is that not enough?\a148Yes, Mrs. Hudson was right. He was more masterful than ever. It was pitiful, however, to see his exhaustion.\a147I only wished to help,\a148 I explained.\a147Exactly! You will help best by doing what you are told.\a148\a147Certainly, Holmes.\a148He relaxed the austerity of his manner.\a147You are not angry?\a148 he asked, gasping for breath.Poor devil, how could I be angry when I saw him lying in such a plight before me?\a147It\a146s for your own sake, Watson,\a148 he croaked.\a147For \imy\i sake?\a148\a147I know what is the matter with me. It is a coolie disease from Sumatra\a151 a thing that the Dutch know more about than we, though they have made little of it up to date. One thing only is certain. It is infallibly deadly, and it is horribly contagious.\a148He spoke now with a feverish energy, the long hands twitching and jerking as he motioned me away.\a147Contagious by touch, Watson\a151 that\a146s it, by touch. Keep your distance and all is well.\a148\a147Good heavens, Holmes! Do you suppose that such a consideration weighs with me for an instant? It would not affect me in the case of a stranger. Do you imagine it would prevent me from doing my duty to so old a friend?\a148Again I advanced, but he repulsed me with a look of furious anger.\a147If you will stand there I will talk. If you do not you must leave the room.\a148I have so deep a respect for the extraordinary qualities of Holmes that I have always deferred to his wishes, even when I least understood them. But now all my professional instincts were aroused. Let him be my master elsewhere, I at least was his in a sick room.\a147Holmes,\a148 said I, \a147you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child, and so I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine your symptoms and treat you for them.\a148He looked at me with venomous eyes.\a147If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have someone in whom I have confidence,\a148 said he.\a147Then you have none in me?\a148\a147In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and, after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say these things, but you leave me no choice.\a148I was bitterly hurt.\a147Such a remark is unworthy of you, Holmes. It shows me very clearly the state of your own nerves. But if you have no confidence in me I would not intrude my services. Let me bring Sir Jasper Meek or Penrose Fisher, or any of the best men in London. But someone you \imust\i have, and that is final. If you think that I am going to stand here and see you die without either helping you myself or bringing anyone else to help you, then you have mistaken your man.\a148\a147You mean well, Watson,\a148 said the sick man with something between a sob and a groan. \a147Shall I demonstrate your own ignorance? What do you know, pray, of Tapanuli fever? What do you know of the black Formosa corruption?\a148\a147I have never heard of either.\a148\a147There are many problems of disease, many strange pathological possibilities, in the East, Watson.\a148 He paused after each sentence to collect his failing strength. \a147I have learned so much during some recent researches which have a medico-criminal aspect. It was in the course of them that I contracted this complaint. You can do nothing.\a148\a147Possibly not. But I happen to know that Dr. Ainstree, the greatest living authority upon tropical disease, is now in London. All remonstrance is useless, Holmes, I am going this instant to fetch him.\a148 I turned resolutely to the door.Never have I had such a shock! In an instant, with a tiger-spring, the dying man had intercepted me. I heard the sharp snap of a twisted key. The next moment he had staggered back to his bed, exhausted and panting after his one tremendous outflame of energy.\a147You won\a146t take the key from me by force, Watson. I\a146ve got you, my friend. Here you are, and here you will stay until I will otherwise. But I\a146ll humour you.\a148 (All this in little gasps, with terrible struggles for breath between.) \a147You\a146ve only my own good at heart. Of course I know that very well. You shall have your way, but give me time to get my strength. Not now, Watson, not now. It\a146s four o\a146clock. At six you can go.\a148\a147This is insanity, Holmes.\a148\a147Only two hours, Watson. I promise you will go at six. Are you content to wait?\a148\a147I seem to have no choice.\a148\a147None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in arranging the clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, there is one other condition that I would make. You will seek help, not from the man you mention, but from the one that I choose.\a148\a147By all means.\a148\a147The first three sensible words that you have uttered since you entered this room, Watson. You will find some books over there. I am somewhat exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor? At six, Watson, we resume our conversation.\a148But it was destined to be resumed long before that hour, and in circumstances which gave me a shock hardly second to that caused by his spring to the door. I had stood for some minutes looking at the silent figure in the bed. His face was almost covered by the clothes and he appeared to be asleep. Then, unable to settle down to reading, I walked slowly round the room, examining the pictures of celebrated criminals with which every wall was adorned. Finally, in my aimless perambulation, I came to the mantelpiece. A litter of pipes, tobacco-pouches, syringes, penknives, revolver-cartridges, and other debris was scattered over it. In the midst of these was a small black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. It was a neat little thing, and I had stretched out my hand to examine it more closely when\a151 It was a dreadful cry that he gave\a151 a yell which might have been heard down the street. My skin went cold and my hair bristled at that horrible scream. As I turned I caught a glimpse of a convulsed face and frantic eyes. I stood paralysed, with the little box in my hand.\a147Put it down! Down, this instant, Watson\a151 this instant, I say!\a148 His head sank back upon the pillow and he gave a deep sigh of relief as I replaced the box upon the mantelpiece. \a147I hate to have my things touched, Watson. You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond endurance. You, a doctor\a151 you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum. Sit down, man, and let me have my rest!\a148The incident left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind. The violent and causeless excitement, followed by this brutality of speech, so far removed from his usual suavity, showed me how deep was the disorganisation of his mind. Of all ruins, that of a noble mind is the most deplorable. I sat in silent dejection until the stipulated time had passed. He seemed to have been watching the clock as well as I, for it was hardly six before he began to talk with the same feverish animation as before.\a147Now, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Have you any change in your pocket?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Any silver?\a148\a147A good deal.\a148\a147How many half-crowns?\a148\a147I have five.\a148\a147Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as they are you can put them in your watch-pocket. And all the rest of your money in your left trouser-pocket. Thank you. It will balance you so much better like that.\a148This was raving insanity. He shuddered, and again made a sound between a cough and a sob.\a147You will now light the gas, Watson, but you will be very careful that not for one instant shall it be more than half on. I implore you to be careful, Watson. Thank you, that is excellent. No, you need not draw the blind. Now you will have the kindness to place some letters and papers upon this table within my reach. Thank you. Now some of that litter from the mantelpiece. Excellent, Watson! There is a sugar-tongs there. Kindly raise that small ivory box with its assistance. Place it here among the papers. Good! You can now go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of 13 Lower Burke Street.\a148To tell the truth, my desire to fetch a doctor had somewhat weakened, for poor Holmes was so obviously delirious that it seemed dangerous to leave him. However, he was as eager now to consult the person named as he had been obstinate in refusing.\a147I never heard the name,\a148 said I.\a147Possibly not, my good Watson. It may surprise you to know that the man upon earth who is best versed in this disease is not a medical man, but a planter. Mr. Culverton Smith is a well-known resident of Sumatra, now visiting London. An outbreak of the disease upon his plantation, which was distant from medical aid, caused him to study it himself, with some rather far-reaching consequences. He is a very methodical person, and I did not desire you to start before six, because I was well aware that you would not find him in his study. If you could persuade him to come here and give us the benefit of his unique experience of this disease, the investigation of which has been his dearest hobby, I cannot doubt that he could help me.\a148I give Holmes\a146s remarks as a consecutive whole and will not attempt to indicate how they were interrupted by gaspings for breath and those clutchings of his hands which indicated the pain from which he was suffering. His appearance had changed for the worse during the few hours that I had been with him. Those hectic spots were more pronounced, the eyes shone more brightly out of darker hollows, and a cold sweat glimmered upon his brow. He still retained, however, the jaunty gallantry of his speech. To the last gasp he would always be the master.\a147You will tell him exactly how you have left me,\a148 said he. \a147You will convey the very impression which is in your own mind\a151 a dying man\a151 a dying and delirious man. Indeed, I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem. Ah, I am wandering! Strange how the brain controls the brain! What was I saying, Watson?\a148\a147My directions for Mr. Culverton Smith.\a148\a147Ah, yes, I remember. My life depends upon it. Plead with him, Watson. There is no good feeling between us. His nephew, Watson\a151 I had suspicions of foul play and I allowed him to see it. The boy died horribly. He has a grudge against me. You will soften him, Watson. Beg him, pray him, get him here by any means. He can save me\a151 only he!\a148\a147I will bring him in a cab, if I have to carry him down to it.\a148\a147You will do nothing of the sort. You will persuade him to come. And then you will return in front of him. Make any excuse so as not to come with him. Don\a146t forget, Watson. You won\a146t fail me. You never did fail me. No doubt there are natural enemies which limit the increase of the creatures. You and I, Watson, we have done our part. Shall the world, then, be overrun by oysters? No, no; horrible! You\a146ll convey all that is in your mind.\a148I left him full of the image of this magnificent intellect babbling like a foolish child. He had handed me the key, and with a happy thought I took it with me lest he should lock himself in. Mrs. Hudson was waiting, trembling and weeping, in the passage. Behind me as I passed from the flat I heard Holmes\a146s high, thin voice in some delirious chant. Below, as I stood whistling for a cab, a man came on me through the fog.\a147How is Mr. Holmes, sir?\a148 he asked.It was an old acquaintance, Inspector Morton, of Scotland Yard, dressed in unofficial tweeds.\a147He is very ill,\a148 I answered.He looked at me in a most singular fashion. Had it not been too fiendish, I could have imagined that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face.\a147I heard some rumour of it,\a148 said he.The cab had driven up, and I left him.Lower Burke Street proved to be a line of fine houses lying in the vague borderland between Notting Hill and Kensington. The particular one at which my cabman pulled up had an air of smug and demure respectability in its old-fashioned iron railings, its massive folding-door, and its shining brasswork. All was in keeping with a solemn butler who appeared framed in the pink radiance of a tinted electric light behind him.\a147Yes, Mr. Culverton Smith is in. Dr. Watson! Very good, sir, I will take up your card.\a148My humble name and title did not appear to impress Mr. Culverton Smith. Through the half-open door I heard a high, petulant, penetrating voice.\a147Who is this person? What does he want? Dear me, Staples, how often have I said that I am not to be disturbed in my hours of study?\a148There came a gentle flow of soothing explanation from the butler.\a147Well, I won\a146t see him, Staples. I can\a146t have my work interrupted like this. I am not at home. Say so. Tell him to come in the morning if he really must see me.\a148Again the gentle murmur.\a147Well, well, give him that message. He can come in the morning, or he can stay away. My work must not be hindered.\a148I thought of Holmes tossing upon his bed of sickness and counting the minutes, perhaps, until I could bring help to him. It was not a time to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him and was in the room.With a shrill cry of anger a man rose from a reclining chair beside the fire. I saw a great yellow face, coarse-grained and greasy, with heavy, double-chin, and two sullen, menacing grey eyes which glared at me from under tufted and sandy brows. A high bald head had a small velvet smoking-cap poised coquettishly upon one side of its pink curve. The skull was of enormous capacity, and yet as I looked down I saw to my amazement that the figure of the man was small and frail, twisted in the shoulders and back like one who has suffered from rickets in his childhood.\a147What\a146s this?\a148 he cried in a high, screaming voice. \a147What is the meaning of this intrusion? Didn\a146t I send you word that I would see you to-morrow morning?\a148\a147I am sorry,\a148 said I, \a147but the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a151\a148The mention of my friend\a146s name had an extraordinary effect upon the little man. The look of anger passed in an instant from his face. His features became tense and alert.\a147Have you come from Holmes?\a148 he asked.\a147I have just left him.\a148\a147What about Holmes? How is he?\a148\a147He is desperately ill. That is why I have come.\a148The man motioned me to a chair, and turned to resume his own. As he did so I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror over the mantelpiece. I could have sworn that it was set in a malicious and abominable smile. Yet I persuaded myself that it must have been some nervous contraction which I had surprised, for he turned to me an instant later with genuine concern upon his features.\a147I am sorry to hear this,\a148 said he. \a147I only know Mr. Holmes through some business dealings which we have had, but I have every respect for his talents and his character. He is an amateur of crime, as I am of disease. For him the villain, for me the microbe. There are my prisons,\a148 he continued, pointing to a row of bottles and jars which stood upon a side table. \a147Among those gelatine cultivations some of the very worst offenders in the world are now doing time.\a148\a147It was on account of your special knowledge that Mr. Holmes desired to see you. He has a high opinion of you and thought that you were the one man in London who could help him.\a148The little man started, and the jaunty smoking-cap slid to the floor.\a147Why?\a148 he asked. \a147Why should Mr. Holmes think that I could help him in his trouble?\a148\a147Because of your knowledge of Eastern diseases.\a148\a147But why should he think that this disease which he has contracted is Eastern?\a148\a147Because, in some professional inquiry, he has been working among Chinese sailors down in the docks.\a148Mr. Culverton Smith smiled pleasantly and picked up his smoking-cap.\a147Oh, that\a146s it\a151 is it?\a148 said he. \a147I trust the matter is not so grave as you suppose. How long has he been ill?\a148\a147About three days.\a148\a147Is he delirious?\a148\a147Occasionally.\a148\a147Tut, tut! This sounds serious. It would be inhuman not to answer his call. I very much resent any interruption to my work, Dr. Watson, but this case is certainly exceptional. I will come with you at once.\a148I remembered Holmes\a146s injunction.\a147I have another appointment,\a148 said I.\a147Very good. I will go alone. I have a note of Mr. Holmes\a146s address. You can rely upon my being there within half an hour at most.\a148It was with a sinking heart that I re-entered Holmes\a146s bedroom. For all that I knew the worst might have happened in my absence. To my enormous relief, he had improved greatly in the interval. His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity.\a147Well, did you see him, Watson?\a148\a147Yes; he is coming.\a148\a147Admirable, Watson! Admirable! You are the best of messengers.\a148\a147He wished to return with me.\a148\a147That would never do, Watson. That would be obviously impossible. Did he ask what ailed me?\a148\a147I told him about the Chinese in the East End.\a148\a147Exactly! Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You can now disappear from the scene.\a148\a147I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.\a148\a147Of course you must. But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone. There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147I fear there is no alternative, Watson. The room does not lend itself to concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion. But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.\a148 Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face. \a147There are the wheels, Watson. Quick, man, if you love me! And don\a146t budge, whatever happens\a151 whatever happens, do you hear? Don\a146t speak! Don\a146t move! Just listen with all your ears.\a148 Then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk droned away into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door. Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man. I could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer. At last that strange hush was broken.\a147Holmes!\a148 he cried. \a147Holmes!\a148 in the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper. \a147Can\a146t you hear me, Holmes?\a148 There was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.\a147Is that you, Mr. Smith?\a148 Holmes whispered. \a147I hardly dared hope that you would come.\a148The other laughed.\a147I should imagine not,\a148 he said. \a147And yet, you see, I am here. Coals of fire, Holmes\a151 coals of fire!\a148\a147It is very good of you\a151 very noble of you. I appreciate your special knowledge.\a148Our visitor sniggered.\a147You do. You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you know what is the matter with you?\a148\a147The same,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Ah! You recognise the symptoms?\a148\a147Only too well.\a148\a147Well, I shouldn\a146t be surprised, Holmes. I shouldn\a146t be surprised if it \iwere\i the same. A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day\a151 a strong, hearty young fellow. It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London\a151 a disease, too, of which I had made such a very special study. Singular coincidence, Holmes. Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect.\a148\a147I knew that you did it.\a148\a147Oh, you did, did you? Well, you couldn\a146t prove it, anyhow. But what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble? What sort of a game is that\a151 eh?\a148I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man. \a147Give me the water!\a148 he gasped.\a147You\a146re precious near your end, my friend, but I don\a146t want you to go till I have had a word with you. That\a146s why I give you water. There, don\a146t slop it about! That\a146s right. Can you understand what I say?\a148Holmes groaned.\a147Do what you can for me. Let bygones be bygones,\a148 he whispered. \a147I\a146ll put the words out of my head\a151 I swear I will. Only cure me, and I\a146ll forget it.\a148\a147Forget what?\a148\a147Well, about Victor Savage\a146s death. You as good as admitted just now that you had done it. I\a146ll forget it.\a148\a147You can forget it or remember it, just as you like. I don\a146t see you in the witness-box. Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you. It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It\a146s not him we are talking about. It\a146s you.\a148\a147Yes, yes.\a148\a147The fellow who came for me\a151 I\a146ve forgotten his name\a151 said that you contracted it down in the East End among the sailors.\a148\a147I could only account for it so.\a148\a147You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not? Think yourself smart, don\a146t you? You came across someone who was smarter this time. Now cast your mind back, Holmes. Can you think of no other way you could have got this thing?\a148\a147I can\a146t think. My mind is gone. For heaven\a146s sake help me! \a148\a147Yes, I will help you. I\a146ll help you to understand just where you are and how you got there. I\a146d like you to know before you die.\a148\a147Give me something to ease my pain.\a148\a147Painful, is it? Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end. Takes you as cramp, I fancy.\a148\a147Yes, yes; it is cramp.\a148\a147Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow. Listen now! Can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began?\a148\a147No, no; nothing.\a148\a147Think again.\a148\a147I\a146m too ill to think.\a148\a147Well, then, I\a146ll help you. Did anything come by post?\a148\a147By post?\a148\a147A box by chance?\a148\a147I\a146m fainting\a151 I\a146m gone!\a148\a147Listen, Holmes!\a148 There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place. \a147You must hear me. You \ishall\i hear me. Do you remember a box\a151 an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it\a151 do you remember?\a148\a147Yes, yes, I opened it. There was a sharp spring inside it. Some joke\a151\a148\a147It was no joke, as you will find to your cost. You fool, you would have it and you have got it. Who asked you to cross my path? If you had left me alone I would not have hurt you.\a148\a147I remember,\a148 Holmes gasped. \a147The spring! It drew blood. This box\a151 this on the table.\a148\a147The very one, by George! And it may as well leave the room in my pocket. There goes your last shred of evidence. But you have the truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you. You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share it. You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I will watch you die.\a148Holmes\a146s voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.\a147What is that?\a148 said Smith. \a147Turn up the gas? Ah, the shadows begin to fall, do they? Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the better.\a148 He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened. \a147Is there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?\a148\a147A match and a cigarette.\a148I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement. He was speaking in his natural voice\a151 a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement looking down at his companion.\a147What\a146s the meaning of this?\a148 I heard him say at last in a dry, rasping tone.\a147The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome. Ah, here \iare\i some cigarettes.\a148 I heard the striking of a match. \a147That is very much better. Halloa! halloa! Do I hear the step of a friend?\a148There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton appeared.\a147All is in order and this is your man,\a148 said Holmes.The officer gave the usual cautions.\a147I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,\a148 he concluded.\a147And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,\a148 remarked my friend with a chuckle. \a147To save an invalid trouble, Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas. By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove. Thank you. I would handle it gingerly if I were you. Put it down here. It may play its part in the trial.\a148There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron and a cry of pain.\a147You\a146ll only get yourself hurt,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Stand still, will you?\a148 There was the click of the closing handcuffs.\a147A nice trap!\a148 cried the high, snarling voice. \a147It will bring you into the dock, Holmes, not me. He asked me to come here to cure him. I was sorry for him and I came. Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes. My word is always as good as yours.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147I had totally forgotten him. My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies. To think that I should have overlooked you! I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the cab below? I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some use at the station.\a147I never needed it more,\a148 said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet. \a147However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means less to me than to most men. It was very essential that I should impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to convey it to you, and you in turn to him. You won\a146t be offended, Watson? You will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme. Knowing his vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork.\a148\a147But your appearance, Holmes\a151 your ghastly face?\a148\a147Three days of absolute fast does not improve one\a146s beauty, Watson. For the rest, there is nothing which a sponge may not cure. With vaseline upon one\a146s forehead, belladonna in one\a146s eyes, rouge over the cheek-bones, and crusts of beeswax round one\a146s lips, a very satisfying effect can be produced. Malingering is a subject upon which I have sometimes thought of writing a monograph. A little occasional talk about half-crowns, oysters-, or any other extraneous subject produces a pleasing effect of delirium.\a148\a147But why would you not let me near you, since there was in truth no infection?\a148\a147Can you ask, my dear Watson? Do you imagine that I have no respect for your medical talents? Could I fancy that your astute judgement would pass a dying man who, however weak, had no rise of pulse or temperature? At four yards, I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring my Smith within my grasp? No, Watson, I would not touch that box. You can just see if you look at it sideways where the sharp spring like a viper\a146s tooth emerges as you open it. I dare say it was by some such device that poor Savage, who stood between this monster and a reversion, was done to death. My correspondence, however, is, as you know, a varied one, and I am somewhat upon my guard against any packages which reach me. It was clear to me, however, that by pretending that he had really succeeded in his design I might surprise a confession. That pretence I have carried out with the thoroughness of the true artist. Thank you, Watson, you must help me on with my coat. When we have finished at the police-station I think that something nutritious at Simpson\a146s would not be out of place.\a148\p\X1\BHis Last Bow\B\X1\c\i\m="last-03.png"\i\cIt was nine o\a146clock at night upon the second of August\a151 the most terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought already that God\a146s curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air. The sun had long set, but one blood-red gash like an open wound lay low in the distant west. Above, the stars were shining brightly, and below, the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay. The two famous Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk, with the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great chalk cliff on which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had perched himself four years before. They stood with their heads close together, talking in low, confidential tones. From below the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the darkness.A remarkable man this Von Bork\a151 a man who could hardly be matched among all the devoted agents of the Kaiser. It was his talents which had first recommended him for the English mission, the most important mission of all, but since he had taken it over those talents had become more and more manifest to the half-dozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth. One of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back to London.\a147So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be back in Berlin within the week,\a148 the secretary was saying. \a147When you get there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive. I happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country.\a148 He was a huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow, heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his political career.Von Bork laughed.\a147They are not very hard to deceive,\a148 he remarked. \a147A more docile, simple folk could not be imagined.\a148\a147I don\a146t know about that,\a148 said the other thoughtfully. \a147They have strange limits and one must learn to observe them. It is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger. One\a146s first impression is that they are entirely soft. Then one comes suddenly upon something very hard, and you know that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the fact. They have, for example, their insular conventions which simply must be observed.\a148\a147Meaning, \a145good form\a146 and that sort of thing?\a148 Von Bork sighed as one who had suffered much.\a147Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations. As an example I may quote one of my own worst blunders\a151 I can afford to talk of my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes. It was on my first arrival. I was invited to a week-end gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister. The conversation was amazingly indiscreet.\a148Von Bork nodded. \a147I\a146ve been there,\a148 said he dryly.\a147Exactly. Well, I naturally sent a \ir\a233sum\a233\i of the information to Berlin. Unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavy-handed in these matters, and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been said. This, of course, took the trail straight up to me. You\a146ve no idea the harm that it did me. There was nothing soft about our British hosts on that occasion, I can assure you. I was two years living it down. Now you, with this sporting pose of yours\a151\a148\a147No, no, don\a146t call it a pose. A pose is an artificial thing. This is quite natural. I am a born sportsman. I enjoy it.\a148\a147Well, that makes it the more effective. You yacht against them, you hunt with them, you play polo, you match them in every game, your four-in-hand takes the prize at Olympia. I have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers. What is the result? Nobody takes you seriously. You are a \a145good old sport,\a146 \a145quite a decent fellow for a German,\a146 a hard-drinking, night-club, knock-about-town, devil-may-care young fellow. And all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in England, and the sporting squire the most astute secret-service man in Europe. Genius, my dear Von Bork\a243genius!\a148\a147You flatter me, Baron. But certainly I may claim that my four years in this country have not been unproductive. I\a146ve never shown you my little store. Would you mind stepping in for a moment?\a148The door of the study opened straight on to the terrace. Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. Only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest.\a147Some of my papers have gone,\a148 said he. \a147When my wife and the household left yesterday for Flushing they took the less important with them. I must, of course, claim the protection of the embassy for the others.\a148\a147Your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite. There will be no difficulties for you or your baggage. Of course, it is just possible that we may not have to go. England may leave France to her fate. We are sure that there is no binding treaty between them.\a148\a147And Belgium?\a148\a147Yes, and Belgium, too.\a148Von Bork shook his head. \a147I don\a146t see how that could be. There is a definite treaty there. She could never recover from such a humiliation.\a148\a147She would at least have peace for the moment.\a148\a147But her honour?\a148\a147Tut, my dear sir, we live in a utilitarian age. Honour is a mediaeval conception. Besides England is not ready. It is an inconceivable thing, but even our special war tax of fifty million, which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of \iThe Times\i, has not roused these people from their slumbers. Here and there one hears a question. It is my business to find an answer. Here and there also there is an irritation. It is my business to soothe it. But I can assure you that so far as the essentials go\a151 the storage of munitions, the preparation for submarine attack, the arrangements for making high explosives\a151 nothing is prepared. How, then, can England come in, especially when we have stirred her up such a devil\a146s brew of Irish civil war, window-breaking Furies, and God knows what to keep her thoughts at home.\a148\a147She must think of her future.\a148\a147Ah, that is another matter. I fancy that in the future we have our own very definite plans about England, and that your information will be very vital to us. It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. If he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready. If it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. I should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is their own affair. This week is their week of destiny. But let us get away from speculation and back to \ireal-politik\i. You were speaking of your papers.\a148 He sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his cigar.The large oak-panelled, book-lined room had a curtain hung in the further corner. When this was drawn it disclosed a large, brass-bound safe. Von Bork detached a small key from his watch chain, and after some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door.\a147Look!\a148 said he, standing clear, with a wave of his hand.The light shone vividly into the opened safe, and the secretary of the embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeon-holes with which it was furnished. Each pigeonhole had its label, and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as \a147Fords\a148, \a147Harbour defences\a148, \a147Aeroplanes\a148, \a147Ireland\a148, \a147Egypt\a148, \a147Portsmouth forts\a148, \a147The Channel\a148, \a147Rosyth\a148, and a score of others. Each compartment was bristling with papers and plans.\a147Colossal!\a148 said the secretary. Putting down his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands.\a147And all in four years, Baron. Not such a bad show for the hard-drinking, hard-riding country squire. But the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it.\a148 He pointed to a space over which \a147Naval Signals\a148 was printed.\a147But you have a good \idossier\i there already.\a148\a147Out of date and waste paper. The Admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed. It was a blow, Baron\a151 the worst setback in my whole campaign. But thanks to my cheque-book and the good Altamont all will be well to-night.\a148The Baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of disappointment.\a147Well, I really can wait no longer. You can imagine that things are moving at present in Carlton Terrace and that we have all to be at our posts. I had hoped to be able to bring news of your great \icoup\i. Did Altamont name no hour?\a148V\ton Bork pushed over a telegram.\tW\till come without fail to-night and bring new sparking plugs.\tA\tLTAMONT. \t\a147Sparking plugs, eh?\a148\a147You see he poses as a motor expert and I keep a full garage. In our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part. If he talks of a radiator it is a battleship, of an oil pump a cruiser, and so on. Sparking plugs are naval signals.\a148\a147From Portsmouth at midday,\a148 said the secretary, examining the superscription. \a147By the way, what do you give him?\a148\a147Five hundred pounds for this particular job. Of course he has a salary as well.\a148\a147The greedy rogue. They are useful, these traitors, but I grudge them their blood money.\a148\a147I grudge Altamont nothing. He is a wonderful worker. If I pay him well, at least he delivers the goods, to use his own phrase. Besides he is not a traitor. I assure you that our most pan-Germanic Junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards England as compared with a real bitter Irish-American.\a148\a147Oh, an Irish-American?\a148\a147If you heard him talk you would not doubt it. Sometimes I assure you I can hardly understand him. He seems to have declared war on the King\a146s English as well as on the English king. Must you really go? He may be here any moment.\a148\a147No. I\a146m sorry, but I have already overstayed my time. We shall expect you early to-morrow, and when you get that signal book through the little door on the Duke of York\a146s steps you can put a triumphant \iFinis\i to your record in England. What! Tokay!\a148He indicated a heavily sealed dust-covered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver.\a147May I offer you a glass before your journey?\a148\a147No, thanks. But it looks like revelry.\a148\a147Altamont has a nice taste in wines, and he took a fancy to my Tokay. He is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things. I have to study him, I assure you.\a148 They had strolled out on to the terrace again, and along it to the further end where at a touch from the Baron\a146s chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled. \a147Those are the lights of Harwich, I suppose,\a148 said the secretary, pulling on his dust coat. \a147How still and peaceful it all seems. There may be other lights within the week, and the English coast a less tranquil place! The heavens, too, may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good Zeppelin promises us comes true. By the way, who is that?\a148Only one window showed a light behind them; in it there stood a lamp, and beside it, seated at a table, was a dear old ruddy-faced woman in a country cap. She was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her.\a147That is Martha, the only servant I have left.\a148The secretary chuckled.\a147She might almost personify Britannia,\a148 said he, \a147with her complete self-absorption and general air of comfortable somnolence. Well, \iau revoir\i, Von Bork!\a148 With a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car, and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot forward through the darkness. The secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine, with his thoughts so full of the impending European tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a little Ford coming in the opposite direction.Von Bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the motor lamps had faded into the distance. As he passed he observed that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired. It was a new experience to him, the silence and darkness of his widespread house, for his family and household had been a large one. It was a relief to him, however, to think that they were all in safety and that, but for that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen, he had the whole place to himself. There was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his study and he set himself to do it until his keen, handsome face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers. A leather valise stood beside his table, and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically the precious contents of his safe. He had hardly got started with the work, however, when his quick ears caught the sound of a distant car. Instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction, strapped up the valise, shut the safe, locked it, and hurried out on to the terrace. He was just in time to see the lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate. A passenger sprang out of it and advanced swiftly towards him, while the chauffeur, a heavily built, elderly man with a grey moustache, settled down like one who resigns himself to a long vigil.\a147Well?\a148 asked Von Bork eagerly, running forward to meet his visitor.For answer the man waved a small brown-paper parcel triumphantly above his head.\a147You can give me the glad hand to-night, mister,\a148 he cried. \a147I\a146m bringing home the bacon at last.\a148\a147The signals?\a148\a147Same as I said in my cable. Every last one of them, semaphore, lamp code, Marconi\a151 a copy, mind you, not the original. That was too dangerous. But it\a146s the real goods, and you can lay to that.\a148 He slapped the German upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from which the other winced.\a147Come in,\a148 he said. \a147I\a146m all alone in the house. I was only waiting for this. Of course a copy is better than the original. If an original were missing they would change the whole thing. You think it\a146s all safe about the copy?\a148The Irish-American had entered the study and stretched his long limbs from the armchair. He was a tall, gaunt man of sixty, with clear-cut features and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance to the caricatures of Uncle Sam. A half-smoked, sodden cigar hung from the corner of his mouth, and as he sat down he struck a match and relit it. \a147Making ready for a move?\a148 he remarked as he looked round him. \a147Say, mister,\a148 he added, as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the curtain was now removed, \a147you don\a146t tell me you keep your papers in that?\a148\a147Why not?\a148\a147Gosh, in a wide-open contraption like that! And they reckon you to be some spy. Why, a Yankee crook would be into that with a can-opener. If I\a146d known that any letter of mine was goin\a146 to lie loose in a thing like that I\a146d have been a mug to write to you at all.\a148\a147It would puzzle any crook to force that safe,\a148 Von Bork answered. \a147You won\a146t cut that metal with any tool.\a148\a147But the lock?\a148\a147No, it\a146s a double combination lock. You know what that is?\a148\a147Search me,\a148 said the American.\a147Well, you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the lock to work.\a148 He rose and showed a double-radiating disc round the keyhole. \a147This outer one is for the letters, the inner one for the figures.\a148\a147Well, well, that\a146s fine.\a148\a147So it\a146s not quite as simple as you thought. It was four years ago that I had it made, and what do you think I chose for the word and figures?\a148\a147It\a146s beyond me.\a148\a147Well, I chose August for the word, and 1914 for the figures, and here we are.\a148The American\a146s face showed his surprise and admiration.\a147My, but that was smart! You had it down to a fine thing.\a148\a147Yes, a few of us even then could have guessed the date. Here it is, and I\a146m shutting down to-morrow morning. \a148\a147Well, I guess you\a146ll have to fix me up also. I\a146m not staying in this goldarned country all on my lonesome. In a week or less, from what I see, John Bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping. I\a146d rather watch him from over the water.\a148\a147But you\a146re an American citizen?\a148\a147Well, so was Jack James an American citizen, but he\a146s doing time in Portland all the same. It cuts no ice with a British copper to tell him you\a146re an American citizen. \a145It\a146s British law and order over here,\a146 says he. By the way, mister, talking of Jack James, it seems to me you don\a146t do much to cover your men.\a148\a147What do you mean?\a148 Von Bork asked sharply.\a147Well, you are their employer, ain\a146t you? It\a146s up to you to see that they don\a146t fall down. But they do fall down, and when did you ever pick them up? There\a146s James\a151\a148\a147It was James\a146s own fault. You know that yourself. He was too self-willed for the job.\a148\a147James was a bonehead\a151 I give you that. Then there was Hollis. \a148\a147The man was mad.\a148\a147Well, he went a bit woozy towards the end. It\a146s enough to make a man bughouse when he has to play a part from morning to night with a hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him. But now there is Steiner\a151\a148Von Bork started violently, and his ruddy face turned a shade paler.\a147What about Steiner?\a148\a147Well, they\a146ve got him, that\a146s all. They raided his store last night, and he and his papers are all in Portsmouth jail. You\a146ll go off and he, poor devil, will have to stand the racket, and lucky if he gets off with his life. That\a146s why I want to get over the water as soon as you do.\a148Von Bork was a strong, self-contained man, but it was easy to see that the news had shaken him.\a147How could they have got on to Steiner?\a148 he muttered. \a147That\a146s the worst blow yet.\a148\a147Well, you nearly had a worse one, for I believe they are not far off me.\a148\a147You don\a146t mean that!\a148\a147Sure thing. My landlady down Fratton way had some inquiries, and when I heard of it I guessed it was time for me to hustle. But what I want to know, mister, is how the coppers know these things? Steiner is the fifth man you\a146ve lost since I signed on with you, and I know the name of the sixth if I don\a146t get a move on. How do you explain it, and ain\a146t you ashamed to see your men go down like this?\a148Von Bork flushed crimson.\a147How dare you speak in such a way!\a148\a147If I didn\a146t dare things, mister, I wouldn\a146t be in your service. But I\a146ll tell you straight what is in my mind. I\a146ve heard that with you German politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to see him put away.\a148Von Bork sprang to his feet.\a147Do you dare to suggest that I have given away my own agents!\a148\a147I don\a146t stand for that, mister, but there\a146s a stool pigeon or a cross somewhere, and it\a146s up to you to find out where it is. Anyhow I am taking no more chances. It\a146s me for little Holland, and the sooner the better.\a148Von Bork had mastered his anger.\a147We have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of victory,\a148 he said. \a147You\a146ve done splendid work and taken risks, and I can\a146t forget it. By all means go to Holland, and you can get a boat from Rotterdam to New York. No other line will be safe a week from now. I\a146ll take that book and pack it with the rest.\a148The American held the small parcel in his hand, but made no motion to give it up.\a147What about the dough?\a148 he asked.\a147The what?\a148\a147The boodle. The reward. The 500 pounds. The gunner turned damned nasty at the last, and I had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it would have been nitsky for you and me. \a145Nothin\a146 doin\a146!\a146 says he, and he meant it, too, but the last hundred did it. It\a146s cost me two hundred pound from first to last, so it isn\a146t likely I\a146d give it up without gettin\a146 my wad. \a148Von Bork smiled with some bitterness. \a147You don\a146t seem to have a very high opinion of my honour,\a148 said he, \a147you want the money before you give up the book.\a148\a147Well, mister, it is a business proposition.\a148\a147All right. Have your way.\a148 He sat down at the table and scribbled a cheque, which he tore from the book, but he refrained from handing it to his companion. \a147After all, since we are to be on such terms, Mr. Altamont,\a148 said he, \a147I don\a146t see why I should trust you any more than you trust me. Do you understand?\a148 he added, looking back over his shoulder at the American. \a147There\a146s the cheque upon the table. I claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up.\a148The American passed it over without a word. Von Bork undid a winding of string and two wrappers of paper. Then he sat gazing for a moment in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him. Across the cover was printed in golden letters \iPractical Handbook of Bee Culture\i. Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in front of his writhing face.\a147Another glass, Watson!\a148 said Mr. Sherlock Holmes as he extended the bottle of Imperial Tokay.The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table pushed forward his glass with some eagerness.\a147It is a good wine, Holmes.\a148\a147A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from Franz Josef\a146s special cellar at the Schoenbrunn Palace. Might I trouble you to open the window for chloroform vapour does not help the palate.\a148The safe was ajar, and Holmes standing in front of it was removing \idossier\i after \idossier\i, swiftly examining each, and then packing it neatly in Von Bork\a146s valise. The German lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his legs. \a147We need not hurry ourselves, Watson. We are safe from interruption. Would you mind touching the bell? There is no one in the house except old Martha, who has played her part to admiration. I got her the situation here when first I took the matter up. Ah, Martha, you will be glad to hear that all is well.\a148The pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway. She curtseyed with a smile to Mr. Holmes, but glanced with some apprehension at the figure upon the sofa.\a147It is all right, Martha. He has not been hurt at all.\a148\a147I am glad of that, Mr. Holmes. According to his lights he has been a kind master. He wanted me to go with his wife to Germany yesterday, but that would hardly have suited your plans, would it, sir?\a148\a147No, indeed, Martha. So long as you were here I was easy in my mind. We waited some time for your signal to-night.\a148\a147It was the secretary, sir.\a148\a147I know. His car passed ours.\a148\a147I thought he would never go. I knew that it would not suit your plans, sir, to find him here.\a148\a147No, indeed. Well, it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until I saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear. You can report to me to-morrow in London, Martha, at Claridge\a146s Hotel.\a148\a147Very good, sir.\a148\a147I suppose you have everything ready to leave.\a148\a147Yes, sir. He posted seven letters to-day. I have the addresses as usual.\a148\a147Very good, Martha. I will look into them to-morrow. Goodnight. These papers,\a148 he continued as the old lady vanished, \a147are not of very great importance, for, of course, the information which they represent has been sent off long ago to the German government. These are the originals which could not safely be got out of the country.\a148\a147Then they are of no use.\a148\a147I should not go so far as to say that, Watson. They will at least show our people what is known and what is not. I may say that a good many of these papers have come through me, and I need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy. It would brighten my declining years to see a German cruiser navigating the Solent according to the mine-field plans which I have furnished. But you, Watson\a148he stopped his work and took his old friend by the shoulders\a147I\a146ve hardly seen you in the light yet. How have the years used you? You look the same blithe boy as ever. \a148\a147I feel twenty years younger, Holmes. I have seldom felt so happy as when I got your wire asking me to meet you at Harwich with the car. But you, Holmes\a151 you have changed very little\a151 save for that horrible goatee.\a148\a147These are the sacrifices one makes for one\a146s country, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, pulling at his little tuft. \a147To-morrow it will be but a dreadful memory. With my hair cut and a few other superficial changes I shall no doubt reappear at Claridge\a146s tomorrow as I was before this American stunt\a151 I beg your pardon, Watson, my well of English seems to be permanently defiled\a151 before this American job came my way.\a148\a147But you have retired, Holmes. We heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the South Downs.\a148\a147Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the \imagnum opus\i of my latter years!\a148 He picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title, \iPractical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen\i. \a147Alone I did it. Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when I watched the little working gangs as once I watched the criminal world of London.\a148\a147But how did you get to work again?\a148\a147Ah, I have often marvelled at it myself. The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. It was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. Since then I have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!\a148The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much gasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmes\a146s statement. He broke out now into a furious stream of German invective, his face convulsed with passion. Holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed and swore.\a147Though unmusical, German is the most expressive of all languages,\a148 he observed when Von Bork had stopped from pure exhaustion. \a147Hullo! Hullo!\a148 he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before putting it in the box. \a147This should put another bird in the cage. I had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal, though I have long had an eye upon him. Mister Von Bork, you have a great deal to answer for.\a148The prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and was staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his captor. I shall get level with you, Altamont,\a148 he said, speaking with slow deliberation. \a147If it takes me all my life I shall get level with you!\a148\a147The old sweet song,\a148 said Holmes. \a147How often have I heard it in days gone by. It was a favourite ditty of the late lamented Professor Moriarty. Colonel Sebastian Moran has also been known to warble it. And yet I live and keep bees upon the South Downs.\a148\a147Curse you, you double traitor!\a148 cried the German, straining against his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes.\a147No, no, it is not so bad as that,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147As my speech surely shows you, Mr. Altamont of Chicago had no existence in fact. I used him and he is gone.\a148\a147Then who are you?\a148\a147It is really immaterial who I am, but since the matter seems to interest you, Mr. Von Bork, I may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the members of your family. I have done a good deal of business in Germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to you.\a148\a147I would wish to know it,\a148 said the Prussian grimly.\a147It was I who brought about the separation between Irene Adler and the late King of Bohemia when your cousin Heinrich was the Imperial Envoy. It was I also who saved from murder, by the Nihilist Klopman, Count Von und Zu Grafenstein, who was your mother\a146s elder brother. It was I\a151\a148Von Bork sat up in amazement.\a147There is only one man,\a148 he cried.\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes.Von Bork groaned and sank back on the sofa. \a147And most of that information came through you,\a148 he cried. \a147What is it worth? What have I done? It is my ruin forever!\a148\a147It is certainly a little untrustworthy,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It will require some checking and you have little time to check it. Your admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster.\a148Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.\a147There are a good many other points of detail which will, no doubt, come to light in good time. But you have one quality which is very rare in a German, Mr. Von Bork: you are a sportsman and you will bear me no ill-will when you realize that you, who have outwitted so many other people, have at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you have done your best for your country, and I have done my best for mine, and what could be more natural? Besides,\a148 he added, not unkindly, as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man, \a147it is better than to fall before some more ignoble foe. These papers are now ready. Watson. If you will help me with our prisoner, I think that we may get started for London at once.\a148It was no easy task to move Von Bork, for he was a strong and a desperate man. Finally, holding either arm, the two friends walked him very slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud confidence when he received the congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a few hours before. After a short, final struggle he was hoisted, still bound hand and foot, into the spare seat of the little car. His precious valise was wedged in beside him.\a147I trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit,\a148 said Holmes when the final arrangements were made. \a147Should I be guilty of a liberty if I lit a cigar and placed it between your lips?\a148But all amenities were wasted upon the angry German.\a147I suppose you realize, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147that if your government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war.\a148\a147What about your government and all this treatment?\a148 said Holmes, tapping the valise.\a147You are a private individual. You have no warrant for my arrest. The whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous.\a148\a147Absolutely,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Kidnapping a German subject.\a148\a147And stealing his private papers.\a148\a147Well, you realize your position, you and your accomplice here. If I were to shout for help as we pass through the village\a151\a148\a147My dear sir, if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us \a145The Dangling Prussian\a146 as a signpost. The Englishman is a patient creature, but at present his temper is a little inflamed, and it would be as well not to try him too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will go with us in a quiet, sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling, and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite. As to you, Watson, you are joining us with your old service, as I understand, so London won\a146t be out of your way. Stand with me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.\a148The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes, recalling once again the days of the past, while their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned to the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head.\a147There\a146s an east wind coming, Watson.\a148\a147I think not, Holmes. It is very warm.\a148\a147Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age. There\a146s an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it\a146s God\a146s own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared. Start her up, Watson, for it\a146s time that we were on our way. I have a cheque for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early, for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can.\a148\p\c\l\X0\BThe Valley Of Fear\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\l\p\i\m="vall-15c.png"\i\c\p\X1\c\BPart 1 - The Tragedy of Birlstone\B\X1\c\BChapter 1\B - \X2\BThe Warning\B\X2\a147I am inclined to think\a151\a148 said I.\a147I should do so,\a148 Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but I\a146ll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption. \a147Really, Holmes,\a148 said I severely, \a147you are a little trying at times.\a148He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap.\a147It is Porlock\a146s writing,\a148 said he thoughtfully. \a147I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock\a146s writing, though I have seen it only twice before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\a148He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.\a147Who then is Porlock?\a148 I asked.\a147Porlock, Watson, is a \inom-de-plume\i, a mere identification mark; but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion\a151 anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister\a151 in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\a148\a147The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as\a151\a148\a147My blushes, Watson!\a148 Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.\a147I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.\a148\a147A touch\a151 a distinct touch!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law\a151 and there lie the glory and the wonder of it. The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every devilry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations\a151 that\a146s the man. But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year\a146s pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of \iThe Dynamics of an Asteroid\i, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it. Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor\a151 such would be your respective \ir\a244les\i. That\a146s genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.\a148\a147May I be there to see!\a148 I exclaimed devoutly. \a147But you were speaking of this man Porlock.\a148\a147Ah, yes\a151 the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link\a151 between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.\a148\a147But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\a148\a147Exactly, my dear Watson. Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value\a151 that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.\a148Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as follows:534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE 26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171\a147What do you make of it, Holmes?\a148\a147It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.\a148\a147But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?\a148\a147In this instance, none at all.\a148\a147Why do you say \a145in this instance\a146?\a148\a147Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.\a148\a147But why \a145Douglas\a146 and \a145Birlstone\a146?\a148\a147Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.\a148\a147Then why has he not indicated the book?\a148\a147Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.\a148Holmes\a146s calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were expecting.\a147The same writing,\a148 remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, \a147and actually signed,\a148 he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle. \a147Come, we are getting on, Watson.\a148 His brow clouded, however, as he glanced over the contents.\a147Dear me, this is very disappointing. I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm.\a147DEAR MR. HOLMES [he says]:\a147I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous\a151 he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you.FRED PORLOCK.\a148Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.\a147After all,\a148 he said at last, \a147there may be nothing in it. It may be only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read the accusation in the other\a146s eyes.\a148\a147The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.\a148\a147No less. When any of that party talk about \a145He\a146 you know whom they mean. There is one predominant \a145He\a146 for all of them.\a148\a147But what can he do?\a148\a147Hum. That\a146s a large question. When you have one of the first brains of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back, there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses\a151 kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.\a148\a147Why did he write at all. Why did he not simply drop it?\a148\a147Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble on him.\a148\a147No doubt,\a148 said I. \a147Of course.\a148 I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it. \a147It\a146s pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.\a148Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. \a147I wonder!\a148 said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. \a147Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man\a146s reference is to a book. That is our point of departure.\a148\a147A somewhat vague one.\a148\a147Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this book?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not. We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a \ilarge\i book, which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book. The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?\a148\a147Chapter the second, no doubt.\a148\a147Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.\a148\a147Column!\a148 I cried.\a147Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?\a148\a147I fear that we have.\a148\a147Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear Watson\a151 yet another brain-wave. Had the volume been an unusual one, he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it\a151 and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very common book.\a148\a147What you say certainly sounds plausible.\a148\a147So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.\a148\a147The Bible!\a148 I cried triumphantly.\a147Good, Watson, good. But not, if I may say so, quite good enough. Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty\a146s associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.\a148\a147But very few books would correspond with that.\a148\a147Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.\a148\a147\iBradshaw\i!\a148\a147There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of \iBradshaw\i is nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate \iBradshaw\i. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is left?\a148\a147An almanac!\a148\a147Excellent, Watson. I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. An almanac. Let us consider the claims of \iWhitaker\a146s Almanac\i. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.\a148 He picked the volume from his desk. \a147Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson. Number thirteen is \a145Mahratta.&#8217. Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is \a145Government\a146; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do. Alas! the next word is \a145pig\a146s-bristles.\a146 We are undone, my good Watson. It is finished!\a148He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.\a147We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!\a148 he cried. \a147We are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is \a145There,\a146 which is much more promising. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is \a145is\a146\a151\a145There is\a146 \a147\a151 Holmes\a146s eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words\a151 \a147\a160\a145danger.\a146 Ha. Ha. Capital. Put that down, Watson. \a145There is danger\a151 may\a151 come\a151 very\a151 soon\a151 one.\a146 Then we have the name \a145Douglas\a146\a151\a145rich\a151 country\a151 now\a151 at\a151 Birlstone\a151 House\a151 Birlstone\a151 confidence\a151 is\a151 pressing.\a146 There, Watson. What do you think of pure reason and its fruit. If the green-grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.\a148I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.\a147What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!\a148 said I.\a147On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,\a148 said Holmes. \a147When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is perfectly clear. Some devilry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is sure\a151\a145confidence\a146 was as near as he could get to \a145confident\a146\a151 that it is pressing. There is our result\a151 and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!\a148Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room.Those were the early days at the end of the \a14680\a146s, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.\a147You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\a148 said he. \a147I wish you luck with your worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.\a148\a147If you said \a145hope\a146 instead of \a145fear,\a146 it would be nearer the truth, I\a146m thinking, Mr. Holmes,\a148 the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. \a147Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I won\a146t smoke, I thank you. I\a146ll have to be pushing on my way; for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your own self. But\a151 but\a151\a148The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.\a147Douglas!\a148 he stammered. \a147Birlstone. What\a146s this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it\a146s witchcraft. Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?\a148\a147It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But why\a151 what\a146s amiss with the names?\a148The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment. \a147Just this,\a148 said he, \a147that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was horribly murdered last night!\a148\p\BChapter 2\B - \X2\BSherlock Holmes Discourses\B\X2It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.\a147Remarkable!\a148 said he. \a147Remarkable!\a148\a147You don\a146t seem surprised.\a148\a147Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised. I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not surprised.\a148In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.\a147I was going down to Birlstone this morning,\a148 said he. \a147I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me\a151 you and your friend here. But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.\a148\a147I rather think not,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!\a148 cried the inspector. \a147The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where\a146s the mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred. We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will follow.\a148\a147No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?\a148MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. \a147Posted in Camberwell\a151 that doesn\a146t help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn\a146t you say that you have sent him money?\a148\a147Twice.\a148\a147And how?\a148\a147In notes to Camberwell post office.\a148\a147Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?\a148\a147No.\a148The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. \a147Why not?\a148\a147Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him.\a148\a147You think there is someone behind him?\a148\a147I know there is.\a148\a147This professor that I\a146ve heard you mention?\a148\a147Exactly!\a148Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me. \a147I won\a146t conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the C.I.D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.\a148\a147I\a146m glad you\a146ve got so far as to recognize the talent.\a148\a147Man, you can\a146t but recognize it. After I heard your view I made it my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I don\a146t mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good Aberdeen upbringing. He\a146d have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father\a146s blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world.\a148Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \a147Great!\a148 he said. \a147Great! Tell me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose, in the professor\a146s study?\a148\a147That\a146s so.\a148\a147A fine room, is it not?\a148\a147Very fine\a151 very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147You sat in front of his writing desk?\a148\a147Just so.\a148\a147Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?\a148\a147Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.\a148\a147It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor\a146s head?\a148\a147I don\a146t miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I saw the picture\a151 a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at you sideways.\a148\a147That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.\a148The inspector endeavoured to look interested.\a147Jean Baptiste Greuze,\a148 Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair, \a147was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working career. Modern criticism has more than endorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries.\a148The inspector\a146s eyes grew abstracted. \a147Hadn\a146t we better\a151\a148 he said.\a147We are doing so,\a148 Holmes interrupted. \a147All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.\a148MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. \a147Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two, and I can\a146t get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\a148\a147All knowledge comes useful to the detective,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Jeune Fille \a135 l\a146Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs\a151 more than forty thousand pounds\a151 at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind.\a148It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.\a147I may remind you,\a148 Holmes continued, \a147that the professor\a146s salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven hundred a year.\a148\a147Then how could he buy\a151\a148\a147Quite so. How could he?\a148\a147Ay, that\a146s remarkable,\a148 said the inspector thoughtfully. \a147Talk away, Mr. Holmes. I\a146m just loving it. It\a146s fine!\a148Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration\a151 the characteristic of the real artist. \a147What about Birlstone?\a148 he asked.\a147We\a146ve time yet,\a148 said the inspector, glancing at his watch. \a147I\a146ve a cab at the door, and it won\a146t take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.\a148\a147No, I never have.\a148\a147Then how do you know about his rooms?\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once\a151 well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers\a151 with the most unexpected results.\a148\a147You found something compromising?\a148\a147Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth. He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147Surely the inference is plain.\a148\a147You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?\a148\a147Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so\a151 dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it\a146s more than interesting\a151 it\a146s just wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary\a151 where does the money come from?\a148\a147Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?\a148\a147Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not. I don\a146t take much stock of detectives in novels\a151 chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. That\a146s just inspiration: not business.\a148\a147Jonathan Wild wasn\a146t a detective, and he wasn\a146t in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century\a1511750 or thereabouts.\a148\a147Then he\a146s no use to me. I\a146m a practical man.\a148\a147Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles\a151 even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It\a146s all been done before, and will be again. I\a146ll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.\a148\a147You\a146ll interest me, right enough.\a148\a147I happen to know who is the first link in his chain\a151 a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you think he pays him?\a148\a147I\a146d like to hear.\a148\a147Six thousand a year. That\a146s paying for brains, you see\a151 the American business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It\a146s more than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty\a146s gains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty\a146s cheques lately\a151 just common innocent cheques that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?\a148\a147Queer, certainly. But what do you gather from it?\a148\a147That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.\a148Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand.\a147He can keep, anyhow,\a148 said he. \a147You\a146ve got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?\a148\a147We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man\a151 this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal\a146s subordinates\a151 had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed, and would be known to all\a151 if only to put the fear of death into them.\a148\a147Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was there any robbery?\a148\a147I have not heard.\a148\a147If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him.\a148\a147Then to Birlstone we must go!\a148 cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. \a147My word! it\a146s later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all.\a148\a147And ample for us both,\a148 said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat. \a147While we are on our way, Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.\a148\a147All about it\a148 proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert\a146s closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.Sherlock Holmes\a146s eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald\a146s short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.\a145DEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD\a146 said the letter which he read to us, \a145official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get for Birlstone, and I will meet it\a151 or have it met if I am too occupied. This case is a snorter. Don\a146t waste a moment in getting started. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find something after his own heart. We would think the whole had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn\a146t a dead man in the middle of it. My word! it \iis\i a snorter.\a146\a147Your friend seems to be no fool,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147No, sir; White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.\a148\a147Well, have you anything more?\a148\a147Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.\a148\a147Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered?\a148\a147That was in the enclosed official report. It didn\a146t say \a145horrible\a146: that\a146s not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That\a146s absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at present\a151 a great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It\a146s the chain between that we are going to trace.\a148\p\BChapter 3\B - \X2\BThe Tragedy of Birlstone\B\X2Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. Only in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast.The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex. For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population; so there seems some prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent.About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had been granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle.The Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth, round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditchlike or unhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water.The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night\a151 a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all England.The house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. This family consisted of only two individuals\a151 John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song. He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained in the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America.The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every meet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance; though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between. This mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband; a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life.It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the wife was either very reticent about her husband\a146s past life, or else, as seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where all gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people\a146s memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance.There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge, Hampstead.Cecil Barker\a146s tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor.In age he was rather younger than Douglas\a151 forty-five at the most\a151 a tall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. \a147An easy-going, free-handed gentleman,\a148 said Ames, the butler. \a147But, my word. I had rather not be the man that crossed him!\a148 He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly with his wife\a151 a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred.As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some of her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th.It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o\a146clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants.The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. \a147We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive,\a148 he said in a hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful head.\a147Nothing has been touched up to now,\a148 said Cecil Barker. \a147I\a146ll answer for that. You see it all exactly as I found it.\a148\a147When was that?\a148 The sergeant had drawn out his notebook.\a147It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not very loud\a151 it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down\a151 I don\a146t suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room.\a148\a147Was the door open?\a148\a147Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom candle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterward.\a148\a147Did you see no one?\a148\a147No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back into the room once more.\a148\a147But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.\a148\a147Yes, it was up until I lowered it.\a148\a147Then how could any murderer have got away. It is out of the question. Mr. Douglas must have shot himself.\a148\a147That was our first idea. But see!\a148 Barker drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent. \a147And look at this!\a148 He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. \a147Someone has stood there in getting out.\a148\a147You mean that someone waded across the moat?\a148\a147Exactly!\a148\a147Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must have been in the water at that very moment.\a148\a147I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the window. But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not let her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.\a148\a147Horrible enough!\a148 said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it. \a147I\a146ve never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash.\a148\a147But, I say,\a148 remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window. \a147It\a146s all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s the question,\a148 said Barker.\a147At what o\a146clock was it raised?\a148\a147It was nearly six o\a146clock,\a148 said Ames, the butler.\a147I\a146ve heard,\a148 said the sergeant, \a147that it was usually raised at sunset. That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.\a148\a147Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,\a148 said Ames. \a147I couldn\a146t raise it until they went. Then I wound it up myself.\a148\a147Then it comes to this,\a148 said the sergeant: \a147If anyone came from outside\a151\iif\i they did\a151 they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven.\a148\a147That is so. Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. That\a146s how I read it; for nothing else will fit the facts.\a148The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor. The initials V.V. and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it.\a147What\a146s this?\a148 he asked, holding it up.Barker looked at it with curiosity. \a147I never noticed it before,\a148 he said. \a147The murderer must have left it behind him.\a148\a147V.V.\a151341. I can make no sense of that.\a148The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. \a147What\a146s V.V.. Somebody\a146s initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\a148It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace\a151 a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.\a147Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,\a148 he said. \a147I saw him myself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it. That accounts for the hammer.\a148\a147We\a146d best put it back on the rug where we found it,\a148 said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. \a147It will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will be a London job before it is finished.\a148 He raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room. \a147Hullo!\a148 he cried, excitedly, drawing the window curtain to one side. \a147What o\a146clock were those curtains drawn?\a148\a147When the lamps were lit,\a148 said the butler. \a147It would be shortly after four.\a148\a147Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.\a148 He held down the light, and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. \a147I\a146m bound to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn, and before six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.\a148\a147That\a146s how I read it,\a148 said Barker. \a147But, I say, aren\a146t we wasting precious time. Couldn\a146t we start out and scout the country before the fellow gets away?\a148The sergeant considered for a moment.\a147There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can\a146t get away by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it\a146s odds that someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can\a146t leave here myself until I am relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand.\a148The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body. \a147What\a146s this mark?\a148 he asked. \a147Could this have any connection with the crime?\a148The dead man\a146s right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin.\a147It\a146s not tattooed,\a148 said the doctor, peering through his glasses. \a147I never saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?\a148\a147I don\a146t profess to know the meaning of it,\a148 said Cecil Barker; \a147but I have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.\a148\a147And so have I,\a148 said the butler. \a147Many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I\a146ve often wondered what it could be.\a148\a147Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,\a148 said the sergeant. \a147But it\a146s a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well, what is it now?\a148The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man\a146s outstretched hand.\a147They\a146ve taken his wedding ring!\a148 he gasped.\a147What!\a148\a147Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it was above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There\a146s the nugget and there\a146s the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.\a148\a147He\a146s right,\a148 said Barker.\a147Do you tell me,\a148 said the sergeant, \a147that the wedding ring was \ibelow\i the other?\a148\a147Always!\a148\a147Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you call the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring back again.\a148\a147That is so!\a148The worthy country policeman shook his head. \a147Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this case the better,\a148 said he. \a147White Mason is a smart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It won\a146t be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we\a146ll have to look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I\a146m not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.\a148\p\BChapter 4\B - \X2\BDarkness\B\X2At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o\a146clock to welcome us. White Mason was a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer.\a147A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!\a148 he kept repeating. \a147We\a146ll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I\a146m hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I can remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr. Holmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville Arms. There\a146s no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The man will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.\a148He was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten minutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made an occasional note; while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom.\a147Remarkable!\a148 he said, when the story was unfolded, \a147most remarkable. I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.\a148\a147I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said White Mason in great delight. \a147We\a146re well up with the times in Sussex. I\a146ve told you now how matters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morning. My word. I made the old mare go. But I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there was nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the facts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own.\a148\a147What were they?\a148 asked Holmes eagerly.\a147Well, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to help me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if Mr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was no stain.\a148\a147That, of course, proves nothing at all,\a148 remarked Inspector MacDonald. \a147There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.\a148\a147Quite so. It doesn\a146t prove it wasn\a146t used. But there might have been stains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were none. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that, if you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long\a151 one could carry it easily under one\a146s coat. There was no complete maker\a146s name; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.\a148\a147A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Exactly.\a148\a147Pennsylvania Small Arms Company\a151 well-known American firm,\a148 said Holmes.White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him.\a147That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful. Wonderful. Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory?\a148Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave.\a147No doubt it is an American shotgun,\a148 White Mason continued. \a147I seem to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of America. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to me. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an American.\a148MacDonald shook his head. \a147Man, you are surely travelling overfast,\a148 said he. \a147I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all.\a148\a147The open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of boots in the corner, the gun!\a148\a147Nothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an American, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don\a146t need to import an American from outside in order to account for American doings.\a148\a147Ames, the butler\a151\a148\a147What about him. Is he reliable?\a148\a147Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos\a151 as solid as a rock. He has been with Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. He has never seen a gun of this sort in the house.\a148\a147The gun was made to conceal. That\a146s why the barrels were sawed. It would fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the house?\a148\a147Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.\a148MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. \a147I\a146m not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146m asking you to conseedar\a148 (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument) \a147I\a146m asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it\a146s just inconceivable. It\a146s clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr. Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.\a148\a147Well, state your case, Mr. Mac,\a148 said Holmes in his most judicial style.\a147The man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the house is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose. You would say the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away at his leisure. That\a146s understandable. But is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat. Is that credible, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, you put the case strongly,\a148 my friend replied thoughtfully. \a147It certainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White Mason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?\a148\a147There were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one could hardly expect them.\a148\a147No tracks or marks?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Ha. Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down to the house at once. There may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive.\a148\a147I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything should strike you\a151\a148 White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.\a147I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,\a148 said Inspector MacDonald. \a147He plays the game.\a148\a147My own idea of the game, at any rate,\a148 said Holmes, with a smile. \a147I go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. If I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time\a151 complete rather than in stages.\a148\a147I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know,\a148 said White Mason cordially. \a147Come along, Dr. Watson, and when the time comes we\a146ll all hope for a place in your book.\a148We walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on each side of it. Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-stained and lichen-blotched, bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn, and the long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay before us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it. As we approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter sunshine.Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of births and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.\a147That\a146s the window,\a148 said White Mason, \a147that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge. It\a146s open just as it was found last night.\a148\a147It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\a148\a147Well, it wasn\a146t a fat man, anyhow. We don\a146t need your deductions, Mr. Holmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.\a148Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.\a147I\a146ve had a good look, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said White Mason. \a147There is nothing there, no sign that anyone has landed\a151 but why should he leave any sign?\a148\a147Exactly. Why should he. Is the water always turbid?\a148\a147Generally about this colour. The stream brings down the clay.\a148\a147How deep is it?\a148\a147About two feet at each side and three in the middle.\a148\a147So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing.\a148\a147No, a child could not be drowned in it.\a148We walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint, gnarled, dried-up person, who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall, formal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The doctor had departed.\a147Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?\a148 asked White Mason.\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Then you can go home. You\a146ve had enough. We can send for you if we want you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr. Cecil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive at your own.\a148He impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact and a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way in his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced.\a147Is it suicide, or is it murder\a151 that\a146s our first question, gentlemen, is it not. If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then came down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him, opened the window, put blood on the\a151\a148\a147We can surely dismiss that,\a148 said MacDonald.\a147So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been done. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house.\a148\a147Well, let\a146s hear the argument.\a148\a147There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened\a151 a weapon that was never seen in the house before. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?\a148\a147No, it does not.\a148\a147Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household\a151 not Mr. Cecil Barker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all of them were on the spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark the sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man\a146s finger, and all the rest of it. It\a146s impossible!\a148\a147You put it very clearly,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I am inclined to agree with you.\a148\a147Well, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties; but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the house between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the door was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been a common burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr. Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and this shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain. There he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas entered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview at all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot.\a148\a147The candle shows that,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Exactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half an inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked; otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr. Barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.\a148\a147That\a146s all clear enough.\a148\a147Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas enters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the curtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring\a151 Heaven only knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle\a151 Douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat\a151 he shot Douglas in this horrible way. He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer card\a151 V.V. 341, whatever that may mean\a151 and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was discovering the crime. How\a146s that, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Very interesting, but just a little unconvincing.\a148\a147Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn\a146t that anything else is even worse!\a148 cried MacDonald. \a147Somebody killed the man, and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that. What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape. Come, Mr. Holmes, it\a146s up to you to give us a lead, since you say Mr. White Mason\a146s theory is unconvincing.\a148Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing no word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left, and his forehead wrinkled with speculation.\a147I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr. Mac,\a148 said he, kneeling down beside the body. \a147Dear me! these injuries are really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment?&#8230. Ames, I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark\a151 a branded triangle inside a circle\a151 upon Mr. Douglas\a146s forearm?\a148\a147Frequently, sir.\a148\a147You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is undoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas\a146s jaw. Did you observe that in life?\a148\a147Yes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.\a148\a147Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?\a148\a147Not for a very long time, sir.\a148\a147Suggestive!\a148 said Holmes. \a147It may, of course, be a mere coincidence, or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct, yesterday, Ames?\a148\a147It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.\a148\a147Ha. The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to make a little progress, do we not. Perhaps you would rather do the questioning, Mr. Mac?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, it\a146s in better hands than mine.\a148\a147Well, then, we will pass to this card\a151 V.V. 341. It is rough cardboard. Have you any of the sort in the house?\a148\a147I don\a146t think so.\a148Holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting paper. \a147It was not printed in this room,\a148 he said; \a147this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?\a148\a147No, sir, nothing.\a148\a147What do you think, Mr. Mac?\a148\a147It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same with his badge upon the forearm.\a148\a147That\a146s my idea, too,\a148 said White Mason.\a147Well, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into the house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this weapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the dead man, which will, when mentioned in the papers, tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together. But why this gun, of all weapons?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147And why the missing ring?\a148\a147Quite so.\a148\a147And why no arrest. It\a146s past two now. I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?\a148\a147That is so, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready, they can hardly miss him. And yet they \ihave\i missed him up to now!\a148 Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill. \a147It is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What\a146s this under the side table?\a148\a147Mr. Douglas\a146s dumb-bells,\a148 said Ames.\a147Dumb-bell\a151 there\a146s only one. Where\a146s the other?\a148\a147I don\a146t know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not noticed them for months.\a148\a147One dumb-bell\a151\a148 Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door.A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face.\a147Sorry to interrupt your consultation,\a148 said he, \a147but you should hear the latest news.\a148\a147An arrest?\a148\a147No such luck. But they\a146ve found his bicycle. The fellow left his bicycle behind him. Come and have a look. It is within a hundred yards of the hall door.\a148We found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed. It was a well used Rudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a considerable journey. There was a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.\a147It would be a grand help to the police,\a148 said the inspector, \a147if these things were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful for what we\a146ve got. If we can\a146t find where he went to, at least we are likely to get where he came from. But what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind. And how in the world has he got away without it. We don\a146t seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Don\a146t we?\a148 my friend answered thoughtfully. \a147I wonder!\a148\p\BChapter 5\B - \X2\BThe People of the Drama\B\X2\a147Have you seen all you want of the study?\a148 asked White Mason as we reentered the house.\a147For the time,\a148 said the inspector, and Holmes nodded.\a147Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house. We could use the dining room, Ames. Please come yourself first and tell us what you know.\a148The butler\a146s account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years before, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had been a kind and considerate employer\a151 not quite what Ames was used to, perhaps; but one can\a146t have everything. He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless man he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked to keep the old ways up.Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas that day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual with him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at the back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell ring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper had come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell. They had gone to the front of the house together.As they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged her to go back.\a147For God\a146s sake, go back to your room!\a148 he cried. \a147Poor Jack is dead. You can do nothing. For God\a146s sake, go back!\a148After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She did not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom. Ames and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not lit at that time; but the lamp was burning. They had looked out of the window; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard. They had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off to get the police.Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper\a146s room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames had been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of hearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any case the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal earlier\a151 half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr. Ames ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale and excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who was coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she answered him, but what she said could not be heard.\a147Take her up. Stay with her!\a148 he had said to Mrs. Allen.She had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe her. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other attempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not possibly have heard anything.So far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement.Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences of the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already told the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion, on that point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other possible way of escaping. He could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three feet deep.In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas was a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young man. He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California, where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly sold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they had renewed their friendship.Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from California, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in England, as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some secret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas\a146s track, which would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had given him this idea; though he had never told him what the society was, nor how he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society.\a147How long were you with Douglas in California?\a148 asked Inspector MacDonald.\a147Five years altogether.\a148\a147He was a bachelor, you say?\a148\a147A widower.\a148\a147Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?\a148\a147No, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid the year before I met him.\a148\a147You don\a146t associate his past with any particular part of America?\a148\a147I have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had worked there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He had travelled a good deal in his time.\a148\a147Was he a politician. Had this secret society to do with politics?\a148\a147No, he cared nothing about politics.\a148\a147You have no reason to think it was criminal?\a148\a147On the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.\a148\a147Was there anything curious about his life in California?\a148\a147He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He would never go where other men were if he could help it. That\a146s why I first thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it was so. I believe that he had a warning of some sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him.\a148\a147What sort of men?\a148\a147Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe and that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good\a151 it was easy to see that.\a148\a147Were these men Americans\a151 Californians?\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t know about Californians. They were Americans, all right. But they were not miners. I don\a146t know what they were, and was very glad to see their backs.\a148\a147That was six years ago?\a148\a147Nearer seven.\a148\a147And then you were together five years in California, so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least?\a148\a147That is so.\a148\a147It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would give rise to it.\a148\a147I think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his mind.\a148\a147But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don\a146t you think he would turn to the police for protection?\a148\a147Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against. There\a146s one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe.\a148\a147I should like these dates a little clearer,\a148 said MacDonald. \a147It is quite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next year, did you not?\a148\a147That is so.\a148\a147And he had been married five years. You must have returned about the time of his marriage.\a148\a147About a month before. I was his best man.\a148\a147Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?\a148\a147No, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.\a148\a147But you have seen a good deal of her since.\a148Barker looked sternly at the detective. \a147I have seen a good deal of \ihim\i since,\a148 he answered. \a147If I have seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is any connection\a151\a148\a147I imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case. But I mean no offence.\a148\a147Some inquiries are offensive,\a148 Barker answered angrily.\a147It\a146s only the facts that we want. It is in your interest and everyone\a146s interest that they should be cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife?\a148Barker grew paler, and his great, strong hands were clasped convulsively together. \a147You have no right to ask such questions!\a148 he cried. \a147What has this to do with the matter you are investigating?\a148\a147I must repeat the question.\a148\a147Well, I refuse to answer.\a148\a147You can refuse to answer; but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal.\a148Barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought. Then he looked up with a smile. \a147Well, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all, and I have no right to stand in the way of it. I\a146d only ask you not to worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just now. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and that was his jealousy. He was fond of me\a151 no man could be fonder of a friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and was forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment. More than once I\a146ve sworn off coming for that reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring letters that I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if it was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful wife\a151 and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I!\a148It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the subject.\a147You are aware,\a148 said he, \a147that the dead man\a146s wedding ring has been taken from his finger?\a148\a147So it appears,\a148 said Barker.\a147What do you mean by \a145appears\a146. You know it as a fact.\a148The man seemed confused and undecided. \a147When I said \a145appears\a146 I meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.\a148\a147The mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed it, would suggest to anyone\a146s mind, would it not, that the marriage and the tragedy were connected?\a148Barker shrugged his broad shoulders. \a147I can\a146t profess to say what it means,\a148 he answered. \a147But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady\a146s honour\a148\a151 his eyes blazed for an instant, and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions\a151\a147well, you are on the wrong track, that\a146s all.\a148\a147I don\a146t know that I\a146ve anything else to ask you at present,\a148 said MacDonald, coldly.\a147There was one small point,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes. \a147When you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was there not?\a148\a147Yes, that was so.\a148\a147By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147You at once rang for help?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And it arrived very speedily?\a148\a147Within a minute or so.\a148\a147And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.\a148Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. \a147I don\a146t see that it was remarkable, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he answered after a pause. \a147The candle threw a very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was on the table; so I lit it.\a148\a147And blew out the candle?\a148\a147Exactly.\a148Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of defiance in it, turned and left the room.Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured a great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own. Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech.\a147Have you found anything out yet?\a148 she asked.Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?\a147We have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,\a148 said the inspector. \a147You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.\a148\a147Spare no money,\a148 she said in a dead, even tone. \a147It is my desire that every possible effort should be made.\a148\a147Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter.\a148\a147I fear not; but all I know is at your service.\a148\a147We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see\a151 that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?\a148\a147No, he turned me back upon the stairs. He begged me to return to my room.\a148\a147Quite so. You had heard the shot, and you had at once come down.\a148\a147I put on my dressing gown and then came down.\a148\a147How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by Mr. Barker?\a148\a147It may have been a couple of minutes. It is so hard to reckon time at such a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could do nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It was all like some dreadful dream.\a148\a147Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot?\a148\a147No, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear him go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous of fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.\a148\a147That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband only in England, have you not?\a148\a147Yes, we have been married five years.\a148\a147Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and might bring some danger upon him?\a148Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. \a147Yes,\a148 she said at last, \a147I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in me\a151 there was the most complete love and confidence between us\a151 but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.\a148\a147How did you know it, then?\a148Mrs. Douglas\a146s face lit with a quick smile. \a147Can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it. I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his American life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by certain words he let fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected.\a148\a147Might I ask,\a148 asked Holmes, \a147what the words were which attracted your attention?\a148\a147The Valley of Fear,\a148 the lady answered. \a147That was an expression he has used when I questioned him. \a145I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am not out of it yet.\a146\a151\a145Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?\a146 I have asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual. \a145Sometimes I think that we never shall,\a146 he has answered.\a148\a147Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?\a148\a147I did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head. \a145It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow,\a146 he said. \a145Please God it shall never fall upon you!\a146 It was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him, of that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.\a148\a147And he never mentioned any names?\a148\a147Yes, he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago. Then I remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror. McGinty was the name\a151 Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered who Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. \a145Never of mine, thank God!\a146 he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could get from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the Valley of Fear.\a148\a147There is one other point,\a148 said Inspector MacDonald. \a147You met Mr. Douglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged to him there. Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?\a148\a147There was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing mysterious.\a148\a147He had no rival?\a148\a147No, I was quite free.\a148\a147You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does that suggest anything to you. Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?\a148For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman\a146s lips.\a147I really cannot tell,\a148 she answered. \a147It is certainly a most extraordinary thing.\a148\a147Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time,\a148 said the inspector. \a147There are some other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.\a148She rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us. \a147What impression has my evidence made upon you?\a148 The question might as well have been spoken. Then, with a bow, she swept from the room.\a147She\a146s a beautiful woman\a151 a very beautiful woman,\a148 said MacDonald thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. \a147This man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be attractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there\a146s that wedding ring. You can\a146t get past that. The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man\a146s\a151 What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?\a148My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. \a147Ames,\a148 he said, when the butler entered, \a147where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?\a148\a147I\a146ll see, sir.\a148He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.\a147Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study?\a148\a147Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his boots when he went for the police.\a148\a147Where are the slippers now?\a148\a147They are still under the chair in the hall.\a148\a147Very good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which tracks may be Mr. Barker\a146s and which from outside.\a148\a147Yes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with blood\a151 so indeed were my own.\a148\a147That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very good, Ames. We will ring if we want you.\a148A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of both were dark with blood.\a147Strange!\a148 murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely. \a147Very strange indeed!\a148Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in silence at his colleagues.The inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent rattled like a stick upon railings.\a147Man,\a148 he cried, \a147there\a146s not a doubt of it. Barker has just marked the window himself. It\a146s a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that you said it was a splay-foot, and here\a146s the explanation. But what\a146s the game, Mr. Holmes\a151 what\a146s the game?\a148\a147Ay, what\a146s the game?\a148 my friend repeated thoughtfully.White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction. \a147I said it was a snorter!\a148 he cried. \a147And a real snorter it is!\a148\p\BChapter 6\B - \X2\BA Dawning Light\B\X2The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire; so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only as some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling, bloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred, which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind.I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On the other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. As I approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my presence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet. Now all pretence of grief had passed away from her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant\a151 but it was just one instant too late\a151 they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came towards me.\a147Excuse me, sir,\a148 said he, \a147but am I addressing Dr. Watson?\a148I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind.\a147We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\a148I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind\a146s eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve. I had grieved with her grief in the dining room. Now I met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.\a147I fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted,\a148 said she.I shrugged my shoulders. \a147It is no business of mine,\a148 said I.\a147Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized\a151\a148\a147There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,\a148 said Barker quickly. \a147As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said I, \a147and so I will beg leave to resume my walk.\a148\a147One moment, Dr. Watson,\a148 cried the woman in a pleading voice. \a147There is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You know Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?\a148\a147Yes, that\a146s it,\a148 said Barker eagerly. \a147Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?\a148\a147I really don\a146t know that I should be justified in discussing such a point.\a148\a147I beg\a151 I implore that you will, Dr. Watson. I assure you that you will be helping us\a151 helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.\a148There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman\a146s voice that for the instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will.\a147Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\a148 I said. \a147He is his own master, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time, he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information.\a148So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate.\a147I wish none of their confidences,\a148 said Holmes, when I reported to him what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. \a147No confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder.\a148\a147You think it will come to that?\a148He was in his most cheerful and \id\a200bonnair\i humour. \a147My dear Watson, when I have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation. I don\a146t say that we have fathomed it\a151 far from it\a151 but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell\a151\a148\a147The dumb-bell!\a148\a147Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell. Well, well, you need not be downcast; for between ourselves I don\a146t think that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson. Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the unilateral development, the imminent danger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson, shocking!\a148He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success; for I had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement.\a147A lie, Watson\a151 a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising lie\a151 that\a146s what meets us on the threshold. There is our starting point. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker\a146s story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why are they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal. Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth.\a147How do I know that they are lying. Because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply \icould\i not be true. Consider. According to the story given to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead man\a146s finger, to replace the other ring\a151 a thing which he would surely never have done\a151 and to put that singular card beside his victim. I say that this was obviously impossible.\a147You may argue\a151 but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will do so\a151 that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of his giving it up at all. No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt at all.\a147But the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there could be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshot\a151 of the man Barker and of the woman Douglas. When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to give a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows dark against him.\a147Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so it was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the pantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut.\a147It is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper\a146s room. It is not so far down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen\a146s room. She is, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder.\a147If this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing from quarter to eleven, when the sound of the shot brought them down, until quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the servants. What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm. That is the question which faces us, and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.\a148\a147I am convinced myself,\a148 said I, \a147that there is an understanding between those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband\a146s murder.\a148\a147Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any man\a146s spoken word stand between them and that husband\a146s dead body. Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly stage-managed; for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing else, this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind.\a148\a147You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of the murder?\a148\a147There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. \a147They come at me like bullets. If you put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder, and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled answer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so clear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way.\a147We will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very attached to each other.\a148\a147That, I am sure, cannot he true,\a148 said I, thinking of the beautiful smiling face in the garden.\a147Well at least they gave that impression. However, we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs\a151\a148\a147We have only their word for that.\a148Holmes looked thoughtful. \a147I see, Watson. You are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false. According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been prepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won\a146t slip into their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons\a151 and an American one at that. How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? It\a146s a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?\a148\a147I confess that I can\a146t explain it.\a148\a147Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death. Does that strike you as very probable, Watson?\a148\a147No, it does not.\a148\a147And once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape.\a148\a147I can conceive of no explanation.\a148\a147And yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise, without any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line of thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is imagination the mother of truth?\a147We will suppose that there \iwas\i a guilty secret, a really shameful secret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. This avenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead man\a146s wedding ring. The vendetta might conceivably date back to the man\a146s first marriage, and the ring be taken for some such reason.\a147Before this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the room. The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to this idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably lowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then raised it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away. So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?\a148\a147Well, it is possible, no doubt,\a148 said I, with some reserve.\a147We have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious case, the couple\a151 not necessarily a guilty couple\a151 realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation. The mark was put by Barker\a146s bloodstained slipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half hour after the event.\a148\a147And how do you propose to prove all this?\a148\a147Well, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That would be the most effective of all proofs. But if not\a151 well, the resources of science are far from being exhausted. I think that an evening alone in that study would help me much.\a148\a147An evening alone!\a148\a147I propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the estimable Ames, who is by no means wholehearted about Barker. I shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. I\a146m a believer in the \igenius loci\i. You smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall see. By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?\a148\a147It is here.\a148\a147Well, I\a146ll borrow that if I may.\a148\a147Certainly\a151 but what a wretched weapon. If there is danger\a151\a148\a147Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your assistance. But I\a146ll take the umbrella. At present I am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.\a148It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back from their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great advance in our investigation.\a147Man, I\a146ll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,\a148 said MacDonald, \a147but that\a146s all past now. We\a146ve had the bicycle identified, and we have a description of our man; so that\a146s a long step on our journey.\a148\a147It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I\a146m sure I congratulate you both with all my heart.\a148\a147Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It was clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified at once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered his name as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise was London made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was undoubtedly an American.\a148\a147Well, well,\a148 said Holmes gleefully, \a147you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It\a146s a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.\a148\a147Ay, it\a146s just that, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said the inspector with satisfaction.\a147But this may all fit in with your theories,\a148 I remarked.\a147That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this man?\a148\a147So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking upon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table. He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.\a148\a147That\a146s what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said White Mason. \a147If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.\a148\a147So one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his description\a151 what of that?\a148MacDonald referred to his notebook. \a147Here we have it so far as they could give it. They don\a146t seem to have taken any very particular stock of him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot nine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a grayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding.\a148\a147Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of Douglas himself,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything else?\a148\a147He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.\a148\a147What about the shotgun?\a148\a147It is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into his valise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty.\a148\a147And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said MacDonald, \a147when we have got our man\a151 and you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it\a151 we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands, we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American calling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No one saw him arrive, so far as we can learn; but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon the road. Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house; but he had intended to use it outside, and there it has very obvious advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken.\a148\a147That is all very clear,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next. He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge down and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make some excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first room that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he could see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was through the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and escaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and made his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That is your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer\a146s escape\a151 or at least that they reached the room before he escaped\a151 and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge. That\a146s \imy\i reading of the first half.\a148The two detectives shook their heads.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery into another,\a148 said the London inspector.\a147And in some ways a worse one,\a148 added White Mason. \a147The lady has never been in America in all her life. What possible connection could she have with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?\a148\a147I freely admit the difficulties,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I propose to make a little investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause.\a148\a147Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147No, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson\a146s umbrella\a151 my wants are simple. And Ames, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question\a151 why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?\a148It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was partly awakened by his entrance.\a147Well, Holmes,\a148 I murmured, \a147have you found anything out?\a148He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall, lean figure inclined towards me. \a147I say, Watson,\a148 he whispered, \a147would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?\a148\a147Not in the least,\a148 I answered in astonishment.\a147Ah, that\a146s lucky,\a148 he said, and not another word would he utter that night.\p\BChapter 7\B - \X2\BThe Solution\B\X2Next morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing. Three had been placed on one side.\a147Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?\a148 Holmes asked cheerfully. \a147What is the latest news of the ruffian?\a148MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.\a147He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton, Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of them\a151 East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool\a151 there is a clear case against him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats.\a148\a147Dear me!\a148 said Holmes sympathetically. \a147Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I went into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words\a151 abandon the case.\a148MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague.\a147You consider it hopeless!\a148 cried the inspector.\a147I consider \iyour\i case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth.\a148\a147But this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his valise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not get him?\a148\a147Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.\a148\a147You are holding something back. It\a146s hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.\a148 The inspector was annoyed.\a147You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study.\a148\a147This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our results. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?\a148\a147Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House.\a148\a147Well, what happened?\a148\a147Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.\a148Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.\a147It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac, when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one\a146s surroundings. Don\a146t look so impatient; for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one\a146s mind. Permit me to give you a sample. \a145Erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence\a151\a146\a160\a148\a147You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\a148\a147Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!\a151 the first sign of temper I have detected in you. Well, I won\a146t read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house.\a148\a147I don\a146t doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.\a148\a147Is it not. Is it not. Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.\a148\a147I\a146m the first to admit that,\a148 said the detective heartily. \a147You get to your point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing it.\a148\a147Well, well, I\a146ll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. I called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did not see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.\a148\a147What. With that?\a148 I ejaculated.\a147No, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour.\a148\a147What were you doing?\a148\a147Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case. I ended by finding it.\a148\a147Where?\a148\a147Ah, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little further, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share everything that I know.\a148\a147Well, we\a146re bound to take you on your own terms,\a148 said the inspector; \a147but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case\a151 why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case?\a148\a147For the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating.\a148\a147We are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor.\a148\a147Yes, yes, so you are. But don\a146t trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won\a146t help you.\a148\a147Then what do you suggest that we do?\a148\a147I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.\a148\a147Well, I\a146m bound to say I\a146ve always found you had reason behind all your queer ways. I\a146ll do what you advise.\a148\a147And you, Mr. White Mason?\a148The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes and his methods were new to him. \a147Well, if it is good enough for the inspector, it is good enough for me,\a148 he said at last.\a147Capital!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Well, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery country walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one. In the evening, tired but happy\a151\a148\a147Man, this is getting past a joke!\a148 cried MacDonald, rising angrily from his chair.\a147Well, well, spend the day as you like,\a148 said Holmes, patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder. \a147Do what you like and go where you will, but meet me here before dusk without fail\a151 without fail, Mr. Mac.\a148\a147That sounds more like sanity.\a148\a147All of it was excellent advice; but I don\a146t insist, so long as you are here when I need you. But now, before we part, I want you to write a note to Mr. Barker.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147I\a146ll dictate it, if you like. Ready?\a147Dear Sir:\a147It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in the hope that we may find some\a151\a148\a147It\a146s impossible,\a148 said the inspector. \a147I\a146ve made inquiry.\a148\a147Tut, tut. My dear sir, please do what I ask you.\a148\a147Well, go on.\a148\a147\a151 in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation. I have made arrangements, and the workmen will be at work early to-morrow morning diverting the stream\a151\a148\a147Impossible!\a148\a147\a151 diverting the stream; so I thought it best to explain matters beforehand.\a147Now sign that, and send it by hand about four o\a146clock. At that hour we shall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like; for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.\a148Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed.\a147Well, gentlemen,\a148 said my friend gravely, \a147I am asking you now to put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our expedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.\a148We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed his example.\a147Well, what are we to do now?\a148 asked MacDonald with some gruffness.\a147Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,\a148 Holmes answered.\a147What are we here for at all. I really think that you might treat us with more frankness.\a148Holmes laughed. \a147Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,\a148 said he. \a147Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder\a151 what can one make of such a \id\a200nouement\i. But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories\a151 are these not the pride and the justification of our life\a146s work. At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable. I only ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.\a148\a147Well, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold,\a148 said the London detective with comic resignation.We all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else was dark and still.\a147How long is this to last?\a148 asked the inspector finally. \a147And what is it we are watching for?\a148\a147I have no more notion than you how long it is to last,\a148 Holmes answered with some asperity. \a147If criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient for all of us. As to what it is we\a151 Well, \ithat\a146s\i what we are watching for!\a148As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man\a146s head and shoulders looking out into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive, stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish\a151 some large, round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement.\a147Now!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147Now!\a148We were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened limbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching.The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes.\a147What the devil is the meaning of all this?\a148 he cried. \a147What are you after, anyhow?\a148Holmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table.\a147This is what we are after, Mr. Barker\a151 this bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.\a148Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. \a147How in thunder came you to know anything about it?\a148 he asked.\a147Simply that I put it there.\a148\a147You put it there. You!\a148\a147Perhaps I should have said \a145replaced it there,\a146\a160\a148 said Holmes. \a147You will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the crook of Dr. Watson\a146s umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle.\a147It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had, of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with you.\a148Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he drew forth a pair of boots. \a147American, as you perceive,\a148 he remarked, pointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat.\a147The clothes are commonplace,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147save only the overcoat, which is full of suggestive touches.\a148 He held it tenderly towards the light. \a147Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece. The tailor\a146s tab is on the neck\a151\a145Neal, Outfitter, Vermissa, U.S.A.\a146 I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector\a146s library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the United States. I have some recollection, Mr. Barker, that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas\a146s first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V.V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation.\a148It was a sight to see Cecil Barker\a146s expressive face during this exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony.\a147You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some more,\a148 he sneered.\a147I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker; but it would come with a better grace from you.\a148\a147Oh, you think so, do you. Well, all I can say is that if there\a146s any secret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.\a148\a147Well, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\a148 said the inspector quietly, \a147we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you.\a148\a147You can do what you damn please about that,\a148 said Barker defiantly.The proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no \ipeine forte et dure\i would ever force him to plead against his will. The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman\a146s voice. Mrs. Douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door, and now she entered the room.\a147You have done enough for now, Cecil,\a148 said she. \a147Whatever comes of it in the future, you have done enough.\a148\a147Enough and more than enough,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. \a147I have every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask \iMr. Douglas\i to tell us his own story.\a148Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes\a146s words. The detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in an instant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched hand.\a147It\a146s best this way, Jack,\a148 his wife repeated; \a147I am sure that it is best.\a148\a147Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, \a147I am sure that you will find it best.\a148The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.\a147I\a146ve heard of you,\a148 said he in a voice which was not quite English and not quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. \a147You are the historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you\a146ve never had such a story as that pass through your hands before, and I\a146ll lay my last dollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you can\a146t miss the public so long as you have those. I\a146ve been cooped up two days, and I\a146ve spent the daylight hours\a151 as much daylight as I could get in that rat trap\a151 in putting the thing into words. You\a146re welcome to them\a151 you and your public. There\a146s the story of the Valley of Fear.\a148\a147That\a146s the past, Mr. Douglas,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes quietly. \a147What we desire now is to hear your story of the present.\a148\a147You\a146ll have it, sir,\a148 said Douglas. \a147May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You\a146re a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and you\a146ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.\a148 He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. \a147I\a146ve heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you. But before you are through with that,\a148 he nodded at my papers, \a147you will say I\a146ve brought you something fresh.\a148Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement. \a147Well, this fairly beats me!\a148 he cried at last. \a147If you are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you sprung from now. You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack-in-a-box.\a148\a147Ah, Mr. Mac,\a148 said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, \a147you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas under this roof.\a148\a147And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?\a148 said the inspector angrily. \a147How long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?\a148\a147Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what more could I do. When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible. Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be, and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape.\a148\a147Well, you figured it out about right,\a148 said Douglas approvingly. \a147I thought I\a146d dodge your British law; for I was not sure how I stood under it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track. Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you\a146ll judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me, Inspector: I\a146m ready to stand pat upon the truth.\a147I\a146m not going to begin at the beginning. That\a146s all there,\a148 he indicated my bundle of papers, \a147and a mighty queer yarn you\a146ll find it. It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they chased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable.\a147I never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her into it. She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be imagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a word here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she knew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything now, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it was a hard question, dear,\a148 he took her hand for an instant in his own, \a147and I acted for the best.\a147Well, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in Tunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all\a151 one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I guessed I\a146d fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb in the States about \a14676. I never doubted that it would be with me still.\a147I was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park. It\a146s as well, or he\a146d have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up\a151 my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings\a151 I put the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing gown, as was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented danger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life\a151 and I\a146ve had more than most in my time\a151 there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn\a146t tell you why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I saw why plain enough.\a147I\a146d just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that I\a146d left on the mantel. At the same moment he sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he\a146d got his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the man that lost his grip.\a147He never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too long. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it off between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I\a146d recognized him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother wouldn\a146t recognize him as I saw him then. I\a146m used to rough work; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.\a147I was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down. I heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was no sight for a woman. I promised I\a146d come to her soon. I said a word or two to Barker\a151 he took it all in at a glance\a151 and we waited for the rest to come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood that they could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only to ourselves.\a147It was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it. The man\a146s sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!\a148The man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man.\a147It was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it all clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about the same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We tied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could find and put them through the window. The card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own.\a147My rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding ring,\a148 he held out his muscular hand, \a147you can see for yourselves that I had struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don\a146t know, anyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn\a146t. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it.\a147Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then get away where I could be joined by my \a145widow\a146 we should have a chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils would give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in the papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all my troubles. I hadn\a146t much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all about this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the rest.\a147I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up there was no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the bell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so, gentlemen, you can do what you please; but I\a146ve told you the truth and the whole truth, so help me God. What I ask you now is how do I stand by the English law?\a148There was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.\a147The English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?\a148\a147I know nothing of this.\a148Holmes\a146s face was very white and grave. \a147The story is not over yet, I fear,\a148 said he. \a147You may find worse dangers than the English law, or even than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr. Douglas. You\a146ll take my advice and still be on your guard.\a148And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me for a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John Douglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and westward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular and terrible narrative\a151 so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it occur.Do not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. As you read on you will find that this is not so. And when I have detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we shall meet once more in those rooms on Baker Street, where this, like so many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.\p\X1\c\BPart 2 - The Scowrers\B\X1\c\BChapter 1\B - \X2\BThe Man\B\X2It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. The steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at every siding\a151 and they were numerous\a151 long lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of America.For desolate it was. Little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous valley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling.The oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The greater number of these were workmen returning from their day\a146s toil in the lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves miners. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen.Several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It is with this man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him; for he is worth it.He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would guess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced.Having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and receiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape.It was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong workers who did it.The young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to him. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench.\a147Hullo, mate!\a148 said he. \a147You seem heeled and ready.\a148The young man smiled with an air of embarrassment.\a147Yes,\a148 said he, \a147we need them sometimes in the place I come from.\a148\a147And where may that be?\a148\a147I\a146m last from Chicago.\a148\a147A stranger in these parts?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You may find you need it here,\a148 said the workman.\a147Ah! is that so?\a148 The young man seemed interested.\a147Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?\a148\a147Nothing out of the way.\a148\a147Why, I thought the country was full of it. You\a146ll hear quick enough. What made you come here?\a148\a147I heard there was always work for a willing man.\a148\a147Are you a member of the union?\a148\a147Sure.\a148\a147Then you\a146ll get your job, I guess. Have you any friends?\a148\a147Not yet; but I have the means of making them.\a148\a147How\a146s that, then?\a148\a147I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen. There\a146s no town without a lodge, and where there is a lodge I\a146ll find my friends.\a148The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering among themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across, seated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.\a147Put it there,\a148 he said.A hand-grip passed between the two.\a147I see you speak the truth,\a148 said the workman. \a147But it\a146s well to make certain.\a148 He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.\a147Dark nights are unpleasant,\a148 said the workman.\a147Yes, for strangers to travel,\a148 the other answered.\a147That\a146s good enough. I\a146m Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. Glad to see you in these parts.\a148\a147Thank you. I\a146m Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J.H. Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.\a148\a147Well, there are plenty of us about. You won\a146t find the order more flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley. But we could do with some lads like you. I can\a146t understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in Chicago.\a148\a147I found plenty of work to do,\a148 said McMurdo.\a147Then why did you leave?\a148McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. \a147I guess those chaps would be glad to know,\a148 he said.Scanlan groaned sympathetically. \a147In trouble?\a148 he asked in a whisper.\a147Deep.\a148\a147A penitentiary job?\a148\a147And the rest.\a148\a147Not a killing!\a148\a147It\a146s early days to talk of such things,\a148 said McMurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. \a147I\a146ve my own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for you. Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?\a148 His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses.\a147All right, mate, no offence meant. The boys will think none the worse of you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?\a148\a147Vermissa.\a148\a147That\a146s the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?\a148McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp. \a147Here is the address\a151 Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It\a146s a boarding house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at Hobson\a146s Patch, and that\a146s here where we are drawing up. But, say, there\a146s one bit of advice I\a146ll give you before we part: If you\a146re in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate. Maybe we\a146ll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.\a148Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts. Night had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the motion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar.\a147I guess hell must look something like that,\a148 said a voice.McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste.\a147For that matter,\a148 said the other policeman, \a147I allow that hell must \ibe\i something like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name, it\a146s more than I\a146d expect. I guess you are new to this part, young man?\a148\a147Well, what if I am?\a148 McMurdo answered in a surly voice.\a147Just this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends. I don\a146t think I\a146d begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were you.\a148\a147What the hell is it to you who are my friends?\a148 roared McMurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation. \a147Did I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a sucker that I couldn\a146t move without it. You speak when you are spoken to, and by the Lord you\a146d have to wait a long time if it was me!\a148 He thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected.\a147No offence, stranger,\a148 said one. \a147It was a warning for your own good, seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.\a148\a147I\a146m new to the place; but I\a146m not new to you and your kind!\a148 cried McMurdo in cold fury. \a147I guess you\a146re the same in all places, shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it.\a148\a147Maybe we\a146ll see more of you before very long,\a148 said one of the patrolmen with a grin. \a147You\a146re a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.\a148\a147I was thinking the same,\a148 remarked the other. \a147I guess we may meet again.\a148\a147I\a146m not afraid of you, and don\a146t you think it!\a148 cried McMurdo. \a147My name\a146s Jack McMurdo\a151 see. If you want me, you\a146ll find me at Jacob Shafter\a146s on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I\a146m not hiding from you, am I. Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face\a151 don\a146t make any mistake about that!\a148There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there was a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him.\a147By Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,\a148 he said in a voice of awe. \a147It was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you the road. I\a146m passing Shafter\a146s on the way to my own shack.\a148There was a chorus of friendly \a147Good-nights\a148 from the other miners as they passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it, McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.The country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way even more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.As they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages.\a147That\a146s the Union House,\a148 said the guide, pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. \a147Jack McGinty is the boss there.\a148\a147What sort of a man is he?\a148 McMurdo asked.\a147What! have you never heard of the boss?\a148\a147How could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in these parts?\a148\a147Well, I thought his name was known clear across the country. It\a146s been in the papers often enough.\a148\a147What for?\a148\a147Well,\a148 the miner lowered his voice\a151\a147over the affairs.\a148\a147What affairs?\a148\a147Good Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offence. There\a146s only one set of affairs that you\a146ll hear of in these parts, and that\a146s the affairs of the Scowrers.\a148\a147Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of murderers, are they not?\a148\a147Hush, on your life!\a148 cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and gazing in amazement at his companion. \a147Man, you won\a146t live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less.\a148\a147Well, I know nothing about them. It\a146s only what I have read.\a148\a147And I\a146m not saying that you have not read the truth.\a148 The man looked nervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger. \a147If killing is murder, then God knows there is murder and to spare. But don\a146t you dare to breathe the name of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper goes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now, that\a146s the house you\a146re after, that one standing back from the street. You\a146ll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township.\a148 \a147I thank you,\a148 said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock.It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of the German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture; the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So entranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the silence.\a147I thought it was father,\a148 said she with a pleasing little touch of a German accent. \a147Did you come to see him. He is down town. I expect him back every minute.\a148McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.\a147No, miss,\a148 he said at last, \a147I\a146m in no hurry to see him. But your house was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me\a151 and now I know it will.\a148\a147You are quick to make up your mind,\a148 said she with a smile.\a147Anyone but a blind man could do as much,\a148 the other answered.She laughed at the compliment. \a147Come right in, sir,\a148 she said. \a147I\a146m Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter\a146s daughter. My mother\a146s dead, and I run the house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along\a151 Ah, here he is. So you can fix things with him right away.\a148A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo explained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old Shafter was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money. For seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging.So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant land.\p\BChapter 2\B - \X2\BThe Bodymaster\B\X2McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk around soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at Shafter\a146s. There were ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the brightest, and his song the best. He was a born boon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around him.And yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and all who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders.From the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On the second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him.\a147Someone else?\a148 he would cry. \a147Well, the worse luck for someone else. Let him look out for himself. Am I to lose my life\a146s chance and all my heart\a146s desire for someone else. You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will say yes, and I\a146m young enough to wait.\a148He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a woman\a146s interest, and finally her love. He could talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came, of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow.Then he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had worked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a strange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy\a151 those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a well-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit.\a147Say, McMurdo,\a148 said he, \a147I remembered your address, so l made bold to call. I\a146m surprised that you\a146ve not reported to the Bodymaster. Why haven\a146t you seen Boss McGinty yet?\a148\a147Well, I had to find a job. I have been busy.\a148\a147You must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good Lord, man! you\a146re a fool not to have been down to the Union House and registered your name the first morning after you came here. If you run against him\a151 well, you \imustn\a146t\i, that\a146s all!\a148McMurdo showed mild surprise. \a147I\a146ve been a member of the lodge for over two years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as all that.\a148\a147Maybe not in Chicago.\a148\a147Well, it\a146s the same society here.\a148\a147Is it?\a148Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in his eyes.\a147Isn\a146t it?\a148\a147You\a146ll tell me that in a month\a146s time. I hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the train.\a148\a147How did you know that?\a148\a147Oh, it got about\a151 things do get about for good and for bad in this district.\a148\a147Well, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.\a148\a147By the Lord, you\a146ll be a man after McGinty\a146s heart!\a148\a147What, does he hate the police too?\a148Scanlan burst out laughing. \a147You go and see him, my lad,\a148 said he as he took his leave. \a147It\a146s not the police but you that he\a146ll hate if you don\a146t! Now, take a friend\a146s advice and go at once!\a148It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the subject without any circumlocution.\a147It seems to me, mister,\a148 said he, \a147that you are gettin\a146 set on my Ettie. Ain\a146t that so, or am I wrong?\a148\a147Yes, that is so,\a148 the young man answered.\a147Vell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain\a146t no manner of use. There\a146s someone slipped in afore you.\a148\a147She told me so.\a148\a147Vell, you can lay that she told you truth. But did she tell you who it vas?\a148\a147No, I asked her; but she wouldn\a146t tell.\a148\a147I dare say not, the leetle baggage. Perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay.\a148\a147Frighten!\a148 McMurdo was on fire in a moment.\a147Ah, yes, my friend. You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him. It is Teddy Baldwin.\a148\a147And who the devil is he?\a148\a147He is a boss of Scowrers.\a148\a147Scowrers. I\a146ve heard of them before. It\a146s Scowrers here and Scowrers there, and always in a whisper. What are you all afraid of. Who \iare\i the Scowrers?\a148The boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did who talked about that terrible society. \a147The Scowrers,\a148 said he, \a147are the Eminent Order of Freemen!\a148The young man stared. \a147Why, I am a member of that order myself.\a148\a147You. I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it\a151 not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek.\a148\a147What\a146s wrong with the order. It\a146s for charity and good fellowship. The rules say so.\a148\a147Maybe in some places. Not here!\a148\a147What is it here?\a148\a147It\a146s a murder society, that\a146s vat it is.\a148McMurdo laughed incredulously. \a147How can you prove that?\a148 he asked.\a147Prove it. Are there not fifty murders to prove it. Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little Billy James, and the others. Prove it. Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?\a148\a147See here!\a148 said McMurdo earnestly. \a147I want you to take back what you\a146ve said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before I quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in the town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. You\a146ll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Shafter.\a148\a147I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, mister. The bosses of the one are the bosses of the other. If you offend the one, it is the other vat vill strike you. We have proved it too often.\a148\a147That\a146s just gossip\a151 I want proof!\a148 said McMurdo.\a147If you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you are yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you vill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder. Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!\a148McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into her ear.\a147Sure, your father is after giving me notice,\a148 he said. \a147It\a146s little I would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it\a146s only a week that I\a146ve known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I can\a146t live without you!\a148\a147Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don\a146t speak so!\a148 said the girl. \a147I have told you, have I not, that you are too late. There is another, and if I have not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.\a148\a147Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?\a148The girl sank her face into her hands. \a147I wish to heaven that you \ihad\i been first!\a148 she sobbed.McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. \a147For God\a146s sake, Ettie, let it stand at that!\a148 he cried. \a147Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise. Follow your heart, acushla! \a145Tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying.\a148He had seized Ettie\a146s white hand between his own strong brown ones.\a147Say that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!\a148\a147Not here?\a148\a147Yes, here.\a148\a147No, no, Jack!\a148 His arms were round her now. \a147It could not be here. Could you take me away?\a148A struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo\a146s face; but it ended by setting like granite. \a147No, here,\a148 he said. \a147I\a146ll hold you against the world, Ettie, right here where we are!\a148\a147Why should we not leave together?\a148\a147No, Ettie, I can\a146t leave here.\a148\a147But why?\a148\a147I\a146d never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out. Besides, what is there to be afraid of. Are we not free folks in a free country. If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?\a148\a147You don\a146t know, Jack. You\a146ve been here too short a time. You don\a146t know this Baldwin. You don\a146t know McGinty and his Scowrers.\a148\a147No, I don\a146t know them, and I don\a146t fear them, and I don\a146t believe in them!\a148 said McMurdo. \a147I\a146ve lived among rough men, my darling, and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me\a151 always, Ettie. It\a146s mad on the face of it! If these men, as your father says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone knows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice. You answer me that, Ettie!\a148\a147Because no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a month if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely, Jack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in the United States was writing about it.\a148\a147Well, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a story. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves.\a148\a147Oh, Jack, don\a146t let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks\a151 the other one!\a148\a147Baldwin\a151 he speaks like that, does he?\a148\a147And that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the truth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him for myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is why I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our only hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.\a148Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo\a146s face, and again it set like granite. \a147No harm shall come to you, Ettie\a151 nor to your father either. As to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst of them before we\a146re through.\a148\a147No, no, Jack. I would trust you anywhere.\a148McMurdo laughed bitterly. \a147Good Lord! how little you know of me! Your innocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in mine. But, hullo, who\a146s the visitor?\a148The door had opened suddenly, and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young man of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. Under his broad-brimmed black felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a handsome face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.Ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm. \a147I\a146m glad to see you, Mr. Baldwin,\a148 said she. \a147You\a146re earlier than I had thought. Come and sit down.\a148Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. \a147Who is this?\a148 he asked curtly.\a147It\a146s a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new boarder here. Mr. McMurdo, may I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?\a148The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.\a147Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?\a148 said Baldwin.\a147I didn\a146t understand that there was any relation between you.\a148\a147Didn\a146t you. Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me that this young lady is mine, and you\a146ll find it a very fine evening for a walk.\a148\a147Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.\a148\a147Aren\a146t you?\a148 The man\a146s savage eyes were blazing with anger. \a147Maybe you are in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!\a148\a147That I am!\a148 cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. \a147You never said a more welcome word.\a148\a147For God\a146s sake, Jack! Oh, for God\a146s sake!\a148 cried poor, distracted Ettie. \a147Oh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!\a148\a147Oh, it\a146s Jack, is it?\a148 said Baldwin with an oath. \a147You\a146ve come to that already, have you?\a148\a147Oh, Ted, be reasonable\a151 be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and forgiving!\a148\a147I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled,\a148 said McMurdo quietly. \a147Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will take a turn down the street with me. It\a146s a fine evening, and there\a146s some open ground beyond the next block.\a148\a147I\a146ll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,\a148 said his enemy. \a147You\a146ll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am through with you!\a148\a147No time like the present,\a148 cried McMurdo.\a147I\a146ll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See here!\a148 He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a circle with a triangle within it. \a147D\a146you know what that means?\a148\a147I neither know nor care!\a148\a147Well, you will know, I\a146ll promise you that. You won\a146t be much older, either. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. As to you, Ettie, you\a146ll come back to me on your knees\a151 d\a146ye hear, girl?\a151 on your knees\a151 and then I\a146ll tell you what your punishment may be. You\a146ve sowed\a151 and by the Lord, I\a146ll see that you reap!\a148 He glanced at them both in fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him.For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw her arms around him.\a147Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly! To-night\a151 Jack\a151 to-night! It\a146s your only hope. He will have your life. I read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?\a148McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back into a chair. \a147There, acushla, there. Don\a146t be disturbed or fear for me. I\a146m a Freeman myself. I\a146m after telling your father about it. Maybe I am no better than the others; so don\a146t make a saint of me. Perhaps you hate me too, now that I\a146ve told you as much?\a148\a147Hate you, Jack. While life lasts I could never do that. I\a146ve heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should I think the worse of you for that. But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty. Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry. Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your trail.\a148\a147I was thinking the same thing,\a148 said McMurdo. \a147I\a146ll go right now and fix it. You can tell your father that I\a146ll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning.\a148The bar of McGinty\a146s saloon was crowded as usual; for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The man was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none could afford to neglect his good will.Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a municipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the public works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty\a146s diamond pins became more obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest, and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square.McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was brilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter.At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong, heavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead black, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly sinister appearance.All else in the man\a151 his noble proportions, his fine features, and his frank bearing\a151 fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger\a146s bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him.\a147Well, young man, I can\a146t call your face to mind.\a148\a147I\a146m new here, Mr. McGinty.\a148\a147You are not so new that you can\a146t give a gentleman his proper title.\a148\a147He\a146s Councillor McGinty, young man,\a148 said a voice from the group.\a147I\a146m sorry, Councillor. I\a146m strange to the ways of the place. But I was advised to see you.\a148\a147Well, you see me. This is all there is. What d\a146you think of me?\a148\a147Well, it\a146s early days. If your heart is as big as your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then I\a146d ask for nothing better,\a148 said McMurdo.\a147By Gar! you\a146ve got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,\a148 cried the saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity.\a147So you are good enough to pass my appearance?\a148\a147Sure,\a148 said McMurdo.\a147And you were told to see me?\a148\a147I was.\a148\a147And who told you?\a148\a147Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health Councillor, and to our better acquaintance.\a148 He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it.McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black eyebrows. \a147Oh, it\a146s like that, is it?\a148 said he. \a147I\a146ll have to look a bit closer into this, Mister\a151\a148\a147McMurdo.\a148\a147A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don\a146t take folk on trust in these parts, nor believe all we\a146re told neither. Come in here for a moment, behind the bar.\a148There was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence. McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket, the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver.\a147See here, my joker,\a148 said he, \a147if I thought you were playing any game on us, it would be short work for you.\a148\a147This is a strange welcome,\a148 McMurdo answered with some dignity, \a147for the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\a148\a147Ay, but it\a146s just that same that you have to prove,\a148 said McGinty, \a147and God help you if you fail. Where were you made?\a148\a147Lodge 29, Chicago.\a148\a147When?\a148\a147June 24, 1872.\a148\a147What Bodymaster?\a148\a147James H. Scott.\a148\a147Who is your district ruler?\a148\a147Bartholomew Wilson.\a148\a147Hum. You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing here?\a148\a147Working, the same as you\a151 but a poorer job.\a148\a147You have your back answer quick enough.\a148\a147Yes, I was always quick of speech.\a148\a147Are you quick of action?\a148\a147I have had that name among those that knew me best.\a148\a147Well, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts?\a148\a147I\a146ve heard that it takes a man to be a brother.\a148\a147True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?\a148\a147I\a146m damned if I tell you that!\a148McGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such fashion, and it amused him. \a147Why won\a146t you tell me?\a148\a147Because no brother may tell another a lie.\a148\a147Then the truth is too bad to tell?\a148\a147You can put it that way if you like.\a148\a147See here, mister, you can\a146t expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he can\a146t answer.\a148McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket.\a147You wouldn\a146t squeal on a fellow?\a148 said he.\a147I\a146ll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!\a148 cried McGinty hotly.\a147You are right, Councillor,\a148 said McMurdo meekly. \a147I should apologize. I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. Look at that clipping.\a148McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week of 1874.\a147Your work?\a148 he asked, as he handed back the paper.McMurdo nodded.\a147Why did you shoot him?\a148\a147I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man Pinto helped me to shove the queer\a151\a148\a147To do what?\a148\a147Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said he would split. Maybe he did split. I didn\a146t wait to see. I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country.\a148\a147Why the coal country?\a148\a147\a160\a145Cause I\a146d read in the papers that they weren\a146t too particular in those parts.\a148McGinty laughed. \a147You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you came to these parts because you thought you\a146d be welcome.\a148\a147That\a146s about the size of it,\a148 McMurdo answered.\a147Well, I guess you\a146ll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?\a148McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. \a147Those never passed the Philadelphia mint,\a148 said he.\a147You don\a146t say!\a148 McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand, which was hairy as a gorilla\a146s. \a147I can see no difference. Gar! you\a146ll be a mighty useful brother, I\a146m thinking. We can do with a bad man or two among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are times when we have to take our own part. We\a146d soon be against the wall if we didn\a146t shove back at those that were pushing us.\a148\a147Well, I guess I\a146ll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.\a148\a147You seem to have a good nerve. You didn\a146t squirm when I shoved this gun at you.\a148\a147It was not me that was in danger.\a148\a147Who then?\a148\a147It was you, Councillor.\a148 McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket. \a147I was covering you all the time. I guess my shot would have been as quick as yours.\a148\a147By Gar!\a148 McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter. \a147Say, we\a146ve had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you\a133. Well, what the hell do you want. And can\a146t I speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us?\a148The bartender stood abashed. \a147I\a146m sorry, Councillor, but it\a146s Ted Baldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.\a148The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servant\a146s shoulder. He pushed the bartender out and closed the door on him.\a147So,\a148 said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, \a147you got here first, did you. I\a146ve a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.\a148\a147Then say it here and now before my face,\a148 cried McMurdo.\a147I\a146ll say it at my own time, in my own way.\a148\a147Tut! Tut!\a148 said McGinty, getting off his barrel. \a147This will never do. We have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it\a146s not for us to greet him in such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!\a148\a147Never!\a148 cried Baldwin in a fury.\a147I\a146ve offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,\a148 said McMurdo. \a147I\a146ll fight him with fists, or, if that won\a146t satisfy him, I\a146ll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I\a146ll leave it to you, Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.\a148\a147What is it, then?\a148\a147A young lady. She\a146s free to choose for herself.\a148\a147Is she?\a148 cried Baldwin.\a147As between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,\a148 said the Boss.\a147Oh, that\a146s your ruling, is it?\a148\a147Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,\a148 said McGinty, with a wicked stare. \a147Is it you that would dispute it?\a148\a147You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You\a146re not Bodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes to a vote\a151\a148The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round the other\a146s neck, and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. In his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not interfered.\a147Easy, Councillor. For heaven\a146s sake, go easy!\a148 he cried, as he dragged him back.McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for breath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.\a147You\a146ve been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin\a151 now you\a146ve got it!\a148 cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. \a147Maybe you think if I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes. It\a146s for the lodge to say that. But so long as I am the chief I\a146ll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.\a148\a147I have nothing against you,\a148 mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.\a147Well, then,\a148 cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff joviality, \a147we are all good friends again and there\a146s an end of the matter.\a148He took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the cork.\a147See now,\a148 he continued, as he filled three high glasses. \a147Let us drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know, there can be no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on the apple of my throat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offence, sir?\a148\a147The clouds are heavy,\a148 answered Baldwin\a147But they will forever brighten.\a148\a147And this I swear!\a148The men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed between Baldwin and McMurdo\a147There!\a148 cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. \a147That\a146s the end of the black blood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further, and that\a146s a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows\a151 and as you will damn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!\a148\a147Faith, I\a146d be slow to do that,\a148 said McMurdo. He held out his hand to Baldwin. \a147I\a146m quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It\a146s my hot Irish blood, they tell me. But it\a146s over for me, and I bear no grudge.\a148Baldwin had to take the proffered hand; for the baleful eye of the terrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the words of the other had moved him.McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. \a147Tut. These girls! These girls!\a148 he cried. \a147To think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys. It\a146s the devil\a146s own luck! Well, it\a146s the colleen inside of them that must settle the question; for it\a146s outside the jurisdiction of a Bodymaster\a151 and the Lord be praised for that. We have enough on us, without the women as well. You\a146ll have to be affiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. We have our own ways and methods, different from Chicago. Saturday night is our meeting, and if you come then, we\a146ll make you free forever of the Vermissa Valley.\a148\p\BChapter 3\B - \X2\BLodge 341, Vermissa\B\X2On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter\a146s and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara\a146s on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together. There was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.Shafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals there when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by.In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions; though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track.One policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck would have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm. After the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to McGinty\a146s saloon, there to make closer acquaintance with \a147the boys,\a148 which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an \a147all in\a148 bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community. Another incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.Just at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district. There was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at him; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the States, and McGinty himself, standing behind his counter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers.\a147A straight whisky; for the night is bitter,\a148 said the police officer. \a147I don\a146t think we have met before, Councillor?\a148\a147You\a146ll be the new captain?\a148 said McGinty.\a147That\a146s so. We\a146re looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading citizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township. Captain Marvin is my name.\a148\a147We\a146d do better without you, Captain Marvin,\a148 said McGinty coldly; \a147for we have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?\a148\a147Well, well, we won\a146t argue about that,\a148 said the police officer good-humouredly. \a147I expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we can\a146t all see it the same.\a148 He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. \a147Hullo! Hullo!\a148 he cried, looking him up and down. \a147Here\a146s an old acquaintance!\a148McMurdo shrank away from him. \a147I was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life,\a148 said he.\a147An acquaintance isn\a146t always a friend,\a148 said the police captain, grinning. \a147You\a146re Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don\a146t you deny it!\a148McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \a147I\a146m not denying it,\a148 said he. \a147D\a146ye think I\a146m ashamed of my own name?\a148\a147You\a146ve got good cause to be, anyhow.\a148\a147What the devil d\a146you mean by that?\a148 he roared with his fists clenched.\a147No, no, Jack, bluster won\a146t do with me. I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one.\a148McMurdo\a146s face fell. \a147Don\a146t tell me that you\a146re Marvin of the Chicago Central!\a148 he cried.\a147Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven\a146t forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.\a148\a147I never shot him.\a148\a147Did you not. That\a146s good impartial evidence, ain\a146t it. Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and me\a151 and perhaps I\a146m going further than my duty in saying it\a151 they could get no clear case against you, and Chicago\a146s open to you to-morrow.\a148\a147I\a146m very well where I am.\a148\a147Well, I\a146ve given you the pointer, and you\a146re a sulky dog not to thank me for it.\a148\a147Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,\a148 said McMurdo in no very gracious manner.\a147It\a146s mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,\a148 said the captain. \a147But, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it\a146s another story. So good-night to you\a151 and good-night, Councillor.\a148He left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero. McMurdo\a146s deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put off all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed. The bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand. He was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and show little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar.On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these had to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in the valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of him were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office.They were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors. Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business, and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called \a147a clean job.\a148To their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them, and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives. The crime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open, for the repeated failure of the law had proved to them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them, and on the other they had an unlimited number of staunch witnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state. In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself\a151 who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one would tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest.\a147The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,\a148 said he.The three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast. They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into the assembly hall.It was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of McGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears.\a147John McMurdo,\a148 said the voice, \a147are you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen?\a148He bowed in assent.\a147Is your lodge No. 29, Chicago?\a148He bowed again.\a147Dark nights are unpleasant,\a148 said the voice.\a147Yes, for strangers to travel,\a148 he answered.\a147The clouds are heavy.\a148\a147Yes, a storm is approaching.\a148\a147Are the brethren satisfied?\a148 asked the Bodymaster.There was a general murmur of assent.\a147We know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us,\a148 said McGinty. \a147We would have you know, however, that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are you ready to be tested?\a148\a147I am.\a148\a147Are you of stout heart?\a148\a147I am.\a148\a147Take a stride forward to prove it.\a148As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There was a low murmur of applause.\a147He is of stout heart,\a148 said the voice. \a147Can you bear pain?\a148\a147As well as another,\a148 he answered.\a147Test him!\a148It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.\a147I can take more than that,\a148 said he.This time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was plucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers.\a147One last word, Brother McMurdo,\a148 said McGinty. \a147You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?\a148\a147I am,\a148 said McMurdo.\a147And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?\a148\a147I do.\a148\a147Then in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its privileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.\a148McMurdo\a146s coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he examined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks.\a147We\a146ve all had it,\a148 said one; \a147but not all as brave as you over it.\a148\a147Tut. It was nothing,\a148 said he; but it burned and ached all the same.When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed.\a147The first business on the agenda paper,\a148 said McGinty, \a147is to read the following letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249. He says:\a147Dear Sir:\a147There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash, coal owners near this place. You will remember that your lodge owes us a return, having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know. He will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom, \a147J.W. WINDLE D.M.A.O.F.\a147Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.\a148 McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. \a147Who will volunteer for the job?\a148Several young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile.\a147You\a146ll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last, you won\a146t be wrong. And you, Wilson.\a148\a147I\a146ve no pistol,\a148 said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.\a147It\a146s your first, is it not. Well, you have to be blooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you\a146ll find it waiting for you, or I\a146m mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will be time enough. You\a146ll get a great welcome when you return.\a148\a147Any reward this time?\a148 asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced, brutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of \a147Tiger.\a148\a147Never mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.\a148\a147What has the man done?\a148 asked young Wilson.\a147Sure, it\a146s not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He has been judged over there. That\a146s no business of ours. All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter.\a148\a147Who are they?\a148 asked someone.\a147Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.\a148\a147And time, too!\a148 cried Ted Baldwin. \a147Folk are gettin\a146 out of hand in these parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker. It\a146s been owing him a long time, and he\a146ll get it full and proper.\a148\a147Get what?\a148 McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.\a147The business end of a buckshot cartridge!\a148 cried the man with a loud laugh. \a147What think you of our ways, Brother?\a148McMurdo\a146s criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. \a147I like it well,\a148 said he. \a147\a160\a145Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.\a148Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.\a147What\a146s that?\a148 cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the table.\a147\a160\a145Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.\a148McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. \a147I would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge.\a148There was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid.\a147I would move,\a148 said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman, \a147that Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.\a148\a147Sure, that was what I meant; I\a146m in your hands,\a148 said McMurdo.\a147Your time will come, Brother,\a148 said the chairman. \a147We have marked you down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in these parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand if it so please you.\a148\a147I will wait for something that is worth while.\a148\a147You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community. I will make the announcement later. Meanwhile,\a148 he glanced at his agenda paper, \a147I have one or two more points to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Carnaway\a146s widow. He was struck down doing the work of the lodge, and it is for us to see that she is not the loser.\a148\a147Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek,\a148 McMurdo\a146s neighbour informed him.\a147The funds are good at the moment,\a148 said the treasurer, with the bankbook in front of him. \a147The firms have been generous of late. Max Linder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If I do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then the West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We have enough on hand to meet any obligations.\a148\a147What about Archie Swindon?\a148 asked a brother.\a147He has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won\a146t show his face in this valley again.\a148An elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman. \a147Mr. Treasurer,\a148 he asked, \a147may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district?\a148\a147Yes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County Railroad Company.\a148\a147And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year?\a148\a147The same company, Brother Morris.\a148\a147And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?\a148\a147They were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.\a148\a147I don\a146t see, Brother Morris,\a148 said the chairman, \a147that it matters to us who buys them, since they can\a146t carry them out of the district.\a148\a147With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter very much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years. We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the result. We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia, and care nothing for our threats. We can take it out of their local bosses; but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And we are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm us. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze them too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.\a148There was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them.\a147It is my advice,\a148 the speaker continued, \a147that we go easier upon the small men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken.\a148Unwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.\a147Brother Morris,\a148 said he, \a147you were always a croaker. So long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the lawcourts. I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,\a148 McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, \a147this lodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.\a148Strange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was familiar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family, some man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with \a147I\a146m Sitting on the Stile, Mary,\a148 and \a147On the Banks of Allan Water.\a148In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high office. There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an example before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round many times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them.\a147Boys,\a148 said he, \a147there\a146s one man in this town that wants trimming up, and it\a146s for you to see that he gets it. I\a146m speaking of James Stanger of the \iHerald\i. You\a146ve seen how he\a146s been opening his mouth against us again?\a148There was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.\a147LAW AND ORDER!That\a146s how he heads it.\a147REIGN OF TERROR IN THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICT\a147Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world. Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of Europe. Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East. The men are known. The organization is patent and public. How long are we to endure it. Can we forever live\a151Sure, I\a146ve read enough of the slush!\a148 cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table. \a147That\a146s what he says of us. The question I\a146m asking you is what shall we say to him?\a148\a147Kill him!\a148 cried a dozen fierce voices.\a147I protest against that,\a148 said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow and shaved face. \a147I tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defence every man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He is respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley. If that man is struck down, there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction.\a148\a147And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?\a148 cried McGinty. \a147Is it by the police. Sure, half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge. Haven\a146t we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?\a148\a147There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,\a148 said Brother Morris.A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.\a147I have but to raise my finger,\a148 cried McGinty, \a147and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.\a148 Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown, \a147See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for some time. You\a146ve no heart yourself, and you try to take the heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I\a146m thinking that it\a146s just there that I ought to place it.\a148Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer. \a147I apologize, Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I should. I am a faithful member\a151 you all know that\a151 and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.\a148The Bodymaster\a146s scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words. \a147Very good, Brother Morris. It\a146s myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,\a148 he continued, looking round at the company, \a147I\a146ll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?\a148\a147Sure!\a148 said the young man eagerly.\a147How many will you take?\a148\a147Half a dozen, and two to guard the door. You\a146ll come, Gower, and you, Mansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.\a148\a147I promised the new brother he should go,\a148 said the chairman.Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven. \a147Well, he can come if he wants,\a148 he said in a surly voice. \a147That\a146s enough. The sooner we get to work the better.\a148The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The words, \a147Vermissa Herald\a148 were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing press.\a147Here, you,\a148 said Baldwin to McMurdo, \a147you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with you. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.\a148It was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below. From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.He was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo\a146s feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was on his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man\a146s head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.\a147You\a146ll kill the man,\a148 said he. \a147Drop it!\a148Baldwin looked at him in amazement. \a147Curse you!\a148 he cried. \a147Who are you to interfere\a151 you that are new to the lodge. Stand back!\a148 He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket.\a147Stand back yourself!\a148 he cried. \a147I\a146ll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me. As to the lodge, wasn\a146t it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed\a151 and what are you doing but killing him?\a148\a147It\a146s truth he says,\a148 remarked one of the men.\a147By Gar! you\a146d best hurry yourselves!\a148 cried the man below. \a147The windows are all lighting up, and you\a146ll have the whole town here inside of five minutes.\a148There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action. Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House, some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty\a146s saloon, whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through. Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side streets, and so by devious paths to their own homes.\p\BChapter 4\B - \X2\BThe Valley of Fear\B\X2When McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink, and his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. Having his own peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at his work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend. Afterwards he read the \iDaily Herald\i. In a special column put in at the last moment he read:OUTRAGE AT THE HERALD OFFICE\a151 EDITOR SERIOUSLY INJURED.It was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been. It ended with the statement:The matter is now in the hands of the police; but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past. Some of the men were recognized, and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained. The source of the outrage was, it need hardly be said, that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period, and against which the \iHerald\i has taken so uncompromising a stand. Mr. Stanger\a146s many friends will rejoice to hear that, though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten, and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger to his life.Below it stated that a guard of police, armed with Winchester rifles, had been requisitioned for the defence of the office.McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:I should wish to speak to you, but would rather not do so in your house. You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill. If you will come there now, I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a feminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life. But it was the writing of a man, and of a well educated one, too. Finally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter through.Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town. In summer it is a favourite resort of the people, but in winter it is desolate enough. From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up. When he turned his face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night before. The lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met.\a147I wanted to have a word with you, Mr. McMurdo,\a148 said the older man, speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground. \a147It was kind of you to come.\a148\a147Why did you not put your name to the note?\a148\a147One has to be cautious, mister. One never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one. One never knows either who to trust or who not to trust.\a148\a147Surely one may trust brothers of the lodge.\a148\a147No, no, not always,\a148 cried Morris with vehemence. \a147Whatever we say, even what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.\a148\a147Look here!\a148 said McMurdo sternly. \a147It was only last night, as you know well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be asking me to break my oath?\a148\a147If that is the view you take,\a148 said Morris sadly, \a147I can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. Things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other.\a148McMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his bearing. \a147Sure I spoke for myself only,\a148 said he. \a147I am a newcomer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr. Morris, and if you think well to say anything to me I am here to hear it.\a148\a147And to take it back to Boss McGinty!\a148 said Morris bitterly.\a147Indeed, then, you do me injustice there,\a148 cried McMurdo. \a147For myself I am loyal to the lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence. It will go no further than me; though I warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy.\a148\a147I have given up looking for either the one or the other,\a148 said Morris. \a147I may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say; but, bad as you are\a151 and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst\a151 still you are new to it, and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs. That was why I thought to speak with you.\a148\a147Well, what have you to say?\a148\a147If you give me away, may a curse be on you!\a148\a147Sure, I said I would not.\a148\a147I would ask you, then, when you joined the Freeman\a146s society in Chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime?\a148\a147If you call it crime,\a148 McMurdo answered.\a147Call it crime!\a148 cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. \a147You have seen little of it if you can call it anything else. Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs. Was that crime\a151 or what else would you call it?\a148\a147There are some would say it was war,\a148 said McMurdo, \a147a war of two classes with all in, so that each struck as best it could.\a148\a147Well, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman\a146s society at Chicago?\a148\a147No, I\a146m bound to say I did not.\a148\a147Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one\a146s fellows. Then I heard of this place\a151 curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears!\a151 and I came to better myself. My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with me. I started a drygoods store on Market Square, and I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I\a146ve the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. I can\a146t get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. If I leave the society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. Oh, man, it is awful\a151 awful!\a148 He put his hands to his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \a147You were too soft for the job,\a148 said he. \a147You are the wrong sort for such work.\a148\a147I had a conscience and a religion; but they made me a criminal among them. I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would come to me. Maybe I\a146m a coward. Maybe it\a146s the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will haunt me forever.\a147It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder. I was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could not trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered. I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his father.\a147But I was a criminal then, part sharer in a murder, lost forever in this world, and lost also in the next. I am a good Catholic; but the priest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I am excommunicated from my faith. That\a146s how it stands with me. And I see you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be. Are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything to stop it?\a148\a147What would you do?\a148 asked McMurdo abruptly. \a147You would not inform?\a148\a147God forbid!\a148 cried Morris. \a147Sure, the very thought would cost me my life.\a148\a147That\a146s well,\a148 said McMurdo. \a147I\a146m thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter.\a148\a147Too much. Wait till you have lived here longer. Look down the valley! See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. Wait, young man, and you will learn for yourself.\a148\a147Well, I\a146ll let you know what I think when I have seen more,\a148 said McMurdo carelessly. \a147What is very clear is that you are not the man for the place, and that the sooner you sell out\a151 if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worth\a151 the better it will be for you. What you have said is safe with me; but, by Gar! if I thought you were an informer\a151\a148\a147No, no!\a148 cried Morris piteously.\a147Well, let it rest at that. I\a146ll bear what you have said in mind, and maybe some day I\a146ll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this. Now I\a146ll be getting home.\a148\a147One word before you go,\a148 said Morris. \a147We may have been seen together. They may want to know what we have spoken about.\a148\a147Ah! that\a146s well thought of.\a148\a147I offer you a clerkship in my store.\a148\a147And I refuse it. That\a146s our business. Well, so long, Brother Morris, and may you find things go better with you in the future.\a148That same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting-room, the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. He passed the sign, and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned.\a147I\a146m not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,\a148 he said at last. \a147I guess I am too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I\a146d stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house.\a148\a147I\a146m proud to see you here, Councillor,\a148 McMurdo answered heartily, bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard. \a147It\a146s an honour that I had not expected.\a148\a147How\a146s the arm?\a148 asked the Boss.McMurdo made a wry face. \a147Well, I\a146m not forgetting it,\a148 he said; \a147but it\a146s worth it.\a148\a147Yes, it\a146s worth it,\a148 the other answered, \a147to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?\a148The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. \a147Morris didn\a146t know I could earn a living here at home. He shan\a146t know either; for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me. But he\a146s a good-hearted old chap. It was his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store.\a148\a147Oh, that was it?\a148\a147Yes, that was it.\a148\a147And you refused it?\a148\a147Sure. Couldn\a146t I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours\a146 work?\a148\a147That\a146s so. But I wouldn\a146t get about too much with Morris.\a148\a147Why not?\a148\a147Well, I guess because I tell you not. That\a146s enough for most folk in these parts.\a148\a147It may be enough for most folk; but it ain\a146t enough for me, Councillor,\a148 said McMurdo boldly. \a147If you are a judge of men, you\a146ll know that.\a148The swarthy giant glared at him, and his hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion. Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion.\a147You\a146re a queer card, for sure,\a148 said he. \a147Well, if you want reasons, I\a146ll give them. Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Nor against me?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s because he daren\a146t trust you. But in his heart he is not a loyal brother. We know that well. So we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him. I\a146m thinking that the time is drawing near. There\a146s no room for scabby sheep in our pen. But if you keep company with a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?\a148\a147There\a146s no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the man,\a148 McMurdo answered. \a147As to being disloyal, if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice.\a148\a147Well, that\a146s enough,\a148 said McGinty, draining off his glass. \a147I came down to give you a word in season, and you\a146ve had it.\a148\a147I\a146d like to know,\a148 said McMurdo, \a147how you ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris at all?\a148McGinty laughed. \a147It\a146s my business to know what goes on in this township,\a148 said he. \a147I guess you\a146d best reckon on my hearing all that passes. Well, time\a146s up, and I\a146ll just say\a151\a148But his leave-taking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. With a sudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his head. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine Constabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo.\a147I thought you\a146d be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of Chicago,\a148 said he. \a147Can\a146t keep out of it, can you. Take your hat and come along with us.\a148\a147I guess you\a146ll pay for this, Captain Marvin,\a148 said McGinty. \a147Who are you, I\a146d like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?\a148\a147You\a146re standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,\a148 said the police captain. \a147We are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is for you to help, not to hinder us in our duty,\a148\a147He is a friend of mine, and I\a146ll answer for his conduct,\a148 said the Boss.\a147By all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days,\a148 the captain answered. \a147This man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here, and he\a146s a crook still. Cover him, Patrolman, while I disarm him.\a148\a147There\a146s my pistol,\a148 said McMurdo coolly. \a147Maybe, Captain Marvin, if you and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily.\a148\a147Where\a146s your warrant?\a148 asked McGinty. \a147By Gar! a man might as well live in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the police. It\a146s a capitalist outrage, and you\a146ll hear more of it, I reckon.\a148\a147You do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor. We\a146ll look after ours.\a148\a147What am I accused of?\a148 asked McMurdo.\a147Of being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the \iHerald\i office. It wasn\a146t your fault that it isn\a146t a murder charge.\a148\a147Well, if that\a146s all you have against him,\a148 cried McGinty with a laugh, \a147you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can bring a dozen to prove it.\a148\a147That\a146s your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow. Meanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don\a146t want a gun across your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will stand no resistance when I am on duty!\a148So determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation. The latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted.\a147What about\a151\a148 he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant.\a147All right,\a148 whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor.\a147I\a146ll bid you good-bye,\a148 said the Boss, shaking hands. \a147I\a146ll see Reilly the lawyer and take the defence upon myself. Take my word for it that they won\a146t be able to hold you.\a148\a147I wouldn\a146t bet on that. Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if he tries any games. I\a146ll search the house before I leave.\a148He did so; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. When he had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters. Darkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group, and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner.\a147Lynch the cursed Scowrer!\a148 they cried. \a147Lynch him!\a148 They laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station. After a short, formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell. Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night before, all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning.But even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the Freemen was able to extend. Late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky, some glasses, and a pack of cards. They spent a hilarious night, without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.Nor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not possibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. On the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants; although they believed that the accused were among them. Cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even more nebulous in their evidence.The injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. He added that he knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials. On the other hand, it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including that high municipal official, Councillor McGinty, that the men had been at a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage.Needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police for their officious zeal.The verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo saw many familiar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved. But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him.\a147You damned murderers!\a148 he said. \a147We\a146ll fix you yet!\a148\p\BChapter 5\B - \X2\BThe Darkest Hour\B\X2If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo\a146s popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society. Already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a man of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out. \a147He\a146ll be the boy for the clean job,\a148 said the oldsters to one another, and waited their time until they could set him to his work.McGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that this was a supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as to laugh.But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie Shafter\a146s father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he allow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly for the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down. She went to his house, as he had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting-room. He was seated at a table, with his back turned and a letter in front of him. A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her\a151 she was still only nineteen. He had not heard her when she pushed open the door. Now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders.If she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only in turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned on her, and his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. For an instant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features\a151 a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life.\a147It\a146s you!\a148 said he, mopping his brow. \a147And to think that you should come to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you. Come then, darling,\a148 and he held out his arms, \a147let me make it up to you.\a148But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man\a146s face. All her woman\a146s instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. Guilt\a151 that was it\a151 guilt and fear!\a147What\a146s come over you, Jack?\a148 she cried. \a147Why were you so scared of me. Oh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at me like that!\a148\a147Sure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours\a151\a148\a147No, no, it was more than that, Jack.\a148 Then a sudden suspicion seized her. \a147Let me see that letter you were writing.\a148\a147Ah, Ettie, I couldn\a146t do that.\a148Her suspicions became certainties. \a147It\a146s to another woman,\a148 she cried. \a147I know it. Why else should you hold it from me. Was it to your wife that you were writing. How am I to know that you are not a married man\a151 you, a stranger, that nobody knows?\a148\a147I am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it. You\a146re the only one woman on earth to me. By the cross of Christ I swear it!\a148He was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him.\a147Well, then,\a148 she cried, \a147why will you not show me the letter?\a148\a147I\a146ll tell you, acushla,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146m under oath not to show it, and just as I wouldn\a146t break my word to you so I would keep it to those who hold my promise. It\a146s the business of the lodge, and even to you it\a146s secret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can\a146t you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?\a148She felt that he was telling the truth. He gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts.\a147Sit here by me, then. It\a146s a queer throne for such a queen; but it\a146s the best your poor lover can find. He\a146ll do better for you some of these days, I\a146m thinking. Now your mind is easy once again, is it not?\a148\a147How can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know that you are a criminal among criminals, when I never know the day that I may hear you are in court for murder. \a145McMurdo the Scowrer,\a146 that\a146s what one of our boarders called you yesterday. It went through my heart like a knife.\a148\a147Sure, hard words break no bones.\a148\a147But they were true.\a148\a147Well, dear, it\a146s not so bad as you think. We are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights.\a148Ettie threw her arms round her lover\a146s neck. \a147Give it up, Jack! For my sake, for God\a146s sake, give it up. It was to ask you that I came here to-day. Oh, Jack, see\a151 I beg it of you on my bended knees. Kneeling here before you I implore you to give it up!\a148He raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast.\a147Sure, my darlin\a146, you don\a146t know what it is you are asking. How could I give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades. If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it. You don\a146t suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?\a148\a147I\a146ve thought of that, Jack. I\a146ve planned it all. Father has saved some money. He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together to Philadelphia or New York, where we would be safe from them.\a148McMurdo laughed. \a147The lodge has a long arm. Do you think it could not stretch from here to Philadelphia or New York?\a148\a147Well, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where father came from\a151 anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!\a148McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. \a147Sure, it is the second time I have heard the valley so named,\a148 said he. \a147The shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you.\a148\a147It darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us. If it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose our chances would be. If you saw the look in those dark, hungry eyes of his when they fall on me!\a148\a147By Gar. I\a146d teach him better manners if I caught him at it! But see here, little girl. I can\a146t leave here. I can\a146t\a151 take that from me once and for all. But if you will leave me to find my own way, I will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it.\a148\a147There is no honour in such a matter.\a148\a147Well, well, it\a146s just how you look at it. But if you\a146ll give me six months, I\a146ll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face.\a148The girl laughed with joy. \a147Six months!\a148 she cried. \a147Is it a promise?\a148\a147Well, it may be seven or eight. But within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us.\a148It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something. There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future. She returned to her father\a146s house more light-hearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.It might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the society would be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things; for there was an official named the County Delegate, living at Hobson\a146s Patch farther down the line, who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo\a146s fellow boarder, received a note from McGinty enclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was sending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given. Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive. McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and that, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house.The same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack. Lawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and ragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher. His companion Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society, with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder. Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three.They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community. They were reticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand.\a147They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,\a148 Lawler explained. \a147They can count on us saying no more than we should. You must not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate that we obey.\a148\a147Sure, we are all in it together,\a148 said Scanlan, McMurdo\a146s mate, as the four sat together at supper.\a147That\a146s true enough, and we\a146ll talk till the cows come home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the past. But till the work is done we say nothing.\a148\a147There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,\a148 said McMurdo, with an oath. \a147I suppose it isn\a146t Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are after. I\a146d go some way to see him get his deserts.\a148\a147No, it\a146s not him yet.\a148\a147Or Herman Strauss?\a148\a147No, nor him either.\a148\a147Well, if you won\a146t tell us we can\a146t make you; but I\a146d be glad to know.\a148Lawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn.In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called \a147the fun.\a148 When, therefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes. When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out, leaving the door open behind them. It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street. They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep snow.The boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary. Here three men were waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation. Then they all moved on together. It was clearly some notable job which needed numbers. At this point there are several trails which lead to various mines. The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path.McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of the men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day\a146s labour began.When they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. They saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved, earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head. As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine house. The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces. For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the manager\a146s heart. At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.\a147Who are you?\a148 he asked as he advanced. \a147What are you loitering there for?\a148There was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered away; but another of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet.There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa.When a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the mine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning, without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime.Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe. The horrible screams of the dead manager\a146s wife pursued them as they hurried to the town. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion.\a147Sure, it is like a war,\a148 he repeated. \a147What is it but a war between us and them, and we hit back where we best can.\a148There was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that night, not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill mine, which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge itself.It would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill William Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known and most popular mine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world; for he was in all ways a model employer. He had insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore, paid off certain drunken and idle \iemploy\a200s\i who were members of the all-powerful society. Coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found himself condemned to death.The execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the party. His flushed face and glazed, bloodshot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades.The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall, taking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must be at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot him again and again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge.\a147Let\a146s hear again how he squealed,\a148 they cried.None of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a killing, and they had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to be relied upon.There had been one \icontretemps\i, for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. It had been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall them. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in their ears.It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen even darker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes, had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. That very night, as the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview.\a147See here, my lad,\a148 said he, \a147I\a146ve got a job that\a146s worthy of you at last. You\a146ll have the doing of it in your own hands.\a148\a147Proud I am to hear it,\a148 McMurdo answered.\a147You can take two men with you\a151 Manders and Reilly. They have been warned for service. We\a146ll never be right in this district until Chester Wilcox has been settled, and you\a146ll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him.\a148\a147I\a146ll do my best, anyhow. Who is he, and where shall I find him?\a148McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook.\a147He\a146s the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He\a146s a hard citizen, an old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We\a146ve had two tries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it. Now it\a146s for you to take it over. That\a146s the house\a151 all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map\a151 without another within earshot. It\a146s no good by day. He\a146s armed and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked. But at night\a151 well, there he is with his wife, three children, and a hired help. You can\a146t pick or choose. It\a146s all or none. If you could get a bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it\a151\a148\a147What\a146s the man done?\a148\a147Didn\a146t I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?\a148\a147Why did he shoot him?\a148\a147What in thunder has that to do with you. Carnaway was about his house at night, and he shot him. That\a146s enough for me and you. You\a146ve got to settle the thing right.\a148\a147There\a146s these two women and the children. Do they go up too?\a148\a147They have to\a151 else how can we get him?\a148\a147It seems hard on them; for they\a146ve done nothing.\a148\a147What sort of fool\a146s talk is this. Do you back out?\a148\a147Easy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should think I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of my own lodge. If it\a146s right or if it\a146s wrong, it\a146s for you to decide.\a148\a147You\a146ll do it, then?\a148\a147Of course I will do it.\a148\a147When?\a148\a147Well, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and make my plans. Then\a151\a148\a147Very good,\a148 said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. \a147I leave it with you. It will be a great day when you bring us the news. It\a146s just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees.\a148McMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which Chester Wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. That very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. It was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. Next day he interviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt.Two nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with their pistols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound save the howling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above them.McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still within. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well alight he and his two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off, safe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told them that their work was done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society.But alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all have gone for nothing. Warned by the fate of the various victims, and knowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. It was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of Iron Dike.\a147Leave him to me,\a148 said McMurdo. \a147He\a146s my man, and I\a146ll get him sure if I have to wait a year for him.\a148A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so for the time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job.Such were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence. Why should these pages be stained by further crimes. Have I not said enough to show the men and their methods?These deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein one may read the details of them. There one may learn of the shooting of Policemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the society\a151 a double outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men. There also one may read of the shooting of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing her husband, who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss McGinty. The killing of the elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the Staphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter.Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.\p\BChapter 6\B - \X2\BDanger\B\X2It was the height of the reign of terror. McMurdo, who had already been appointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more popular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the \iHerald\i office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their opponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard.\a147Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?\a148\a147Sure.\a148\a147I can\a146t forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.\a148\a147What else could I do if you trusted me. It wasn\a146t that I agreed with what you said.\a148\a147I know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe. I\a146ve a secret here,\a148 he put his hand to his breast, \a147and it is just burning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but me. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don\a146t, it may bring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!\a148McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. \a147That\a146s the physic for the likes of you,\a148 said he. \a147Now let me hear of it.\a148Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. \a147I can tell it to you all in one sentence,\a148 said he. \a147There\a146s a detective on our trail.\a148McMurdo stared at him in astonishment. \a147Why, man, you\a146re crazy,\a148 he said. \a147Isn\a146t the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us?\a148\a147No, no, it\a146s no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it is little that they can do. But you\a146ve heard of Pinkerton\a146s?\a148\a147I\a146ve read of some folk of that name.\a148\a147Well, you can take it from me you\a146ve no show when they are on your trail. It\a146s not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern. It\a146s a dead earnest business proposition that\a146s out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them. If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business, we are all destroyed.\a148\a147We must kill him.\a148\a147Ah, it\a146s the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the lodge. Didn\a146t I say to you that it would end in murder?\a148\a147Sure, what is murder. Isn\a146t it common enough in these parts?\a148\a147It is, indeed; but it\a146s not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered. I\a146d never rest easy again. And yet it\a146s our own necks that may be at stake. In God\a146s name what shall I do?\a148 He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision.But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he shared the other\a146s opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He gripped Morris\a146s shoulder and shook him in his earnestness.\a147See here, man,\a148 he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his excitement, \a147you won\a146t gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake. Let\a146s have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he. How did you hear of him. Why did you come to me?\a148\a147I came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good friends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here\a146s a letter that I had from him yesterday. It\a146s this part from the top of the page. You can read it yourself.\a148This was what McMurdo read:How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read plenty of them in the papers. Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long. Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they\a146ll get there. They are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing has got to be stopped right now.\a147Now read the postscript.\a148Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business; so it goes no further. It\a146s a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from.McMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless hands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before him.\a147Does anyone else know of this?\a148 he asked.\a147I have told no one else.\a148\a147But this man\a151 your friend\a151 has he any other person that he would be likely to write to?\a148\a147Well, I dare say he knows one or two more.\a148\a147Of the lodge?\a148\a147It\a146s likely enough.\a148\a147I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow Birdy Edwards\a151 then we could get on his trail.\a148\a147Well, it\a146s possible. But I should not think he knew him. He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he know this Pinkerton man?\a148McMurdo gave a violent start.\a147By Gar!\a148 he cried, \a147I\a146ve got him. What a fool I was not to know it. Lord! but we\a146re in luck. We will fix him before he can do any harm. See here, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?\a148\a147Sure, if you will only take it off mine.\a148\a147I\a146ll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your name need not be mentioned. I\a146ll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this letter has come. Will that content you?\a148\a147It\a146s just what I would ask.\a148\a147Then leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I\a146ll get down to the lodge, and we\a146ll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.\a148\a147You wouldn\a146t kill this man?\a148\a147The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be, and the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle themselves. I have hold of it now.\a148Morris shook his head sadly as he left. \a147I feel that his blood is on my hands,\a148 he groaned.\a147Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,\a148 said McMurdo, smiling grimly. \a147It\a146s him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we\a146ll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you\a146ve surely saved the lodge.\a148And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his guilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers; but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old man Shafter\a146s. The house was forbidden him; but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish devilry had gone from her lover\a146s eyes. She read his danger in his earnest face.\a147Something has happened!\a148 she cried. \a147Oh, Jack, you are in danger!\a148\a147Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse.\a148\a147Make a move?\a148\a147I promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is coming. I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming.\a148\a147The police?\a148\a147Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn\a146t know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean to the likes of me. I\a146m too deep in this thing, and I may have to get out of it quick. You said you would come with me if I went.\a148\a147Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!\a148\a147I\a146m an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn\a146t hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. Would you trust me?\a148She put her hand in his without a word. \a147Well, then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you, for indeed it\a146s the only way for us. Things are going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I\a146m one, anyhow. If I go, by day or night, it\a146s you that must come with me!\a148\a147I\a146d come after you, Jack.\a148\a147No, no, you shall come \iwith\i me. If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message. It\a146s with me you must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it\a146s there I\a146d leave you till we can get married. Will you come?\a148\a147Yes, Jack, I will come.\a148\a147God bless you for your trust in me. It\a146s a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you.\a148\a147Day or night, I\a146ll come at the word, Jack.\a148Somewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape had been begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already assembled, and only by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news.\a147Indeed, it\a146s glad we are to see you, Brother!\a148 cried the chairman. \a147There\a146s business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right.\a148\a147It\a146s Lander and Egan,\a148 explained his neighbour as he took his seat. \a147They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who\a146s to say which fired the bullet?\a148McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of expectation.\a147Eminent Bodymaster,\a148 he said, in a solemn voice, \a147I claim urgency!\a148\a147Brother McMurdo claims urgency,\a148 said McGinty. \a147It\a146s a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.\a148McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.\a147Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,\a148 he said, \a147I am the bearer of ill news this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed, than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon\a146s cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.\a148There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman.\a147What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?\a148 he asked.\a147It is in this letter which has come into my hands,\a148 said McMurdo. He read the passage aloud. \a147It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your hands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has reached me.\a148\a147Let me say, Mr. Chairman,\a148 said one of the older brethren, \a147that I have heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best man in the Pinkerton service.\a148\a147Does anyone know him by sight?\a148 asked McGinty.\a147Yes,\a148 said McMurdo, \a147I do.\a148There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.\a147I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,\a148 he continued with an exulting smile upon his face. \a147If we act quickly and wisely, we can cut this thing short. If I have your confidence and your help, it is little that we have to fear.\a148\a147What have we to fear, anyhow. What can he know of our affairs?\a148\a147You might say so if all were as staunch as you, Councillor. But this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought. He will get at our secrets\a151 maybe has got them already. There\a146s only one sure cure.\a148\a147That he never leaves the valley,\a148 said Baldwin.McMurdo nodded. \a147Good for you, Brother Baldwin,\a148 he said. \a147You and I have had our differences, but you have said the true word to-night.\a148\a147Where is he, then. Where shall we know him?\a148\a147Eminent Bodymaster,\a148 said McMurdo, earnestly, \a147I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of any chance of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee, Mr. Chairman\a151 yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know and of what I advise should be done.\a148The proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen. Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary, Harraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing.The usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there was a cloud upon the men\a146s spirits, and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long. The horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them. They broke up early and left their leaders to their council.\a147Now, McMurdo!\a148 said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men sat frozen in their seats.\a147I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,\a148 McMurdo explained. \a147I need not tell you that he is not here under that name. He\a146s a brave man, but not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson\a146s Patch.\a148\a147How do you know this?\a148\a147Because I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now I\a146m sure it\a146s the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday\a151 a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a reporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called \a145the outrages\a146 for a New York paper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet I was giving nothing away. \a145I\a146d pay for it and pay well,\a146 said he, \a145if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor.\a146 I said what I thought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information. \a145There\a146s ten times that for you,\a146 said he, \a145if you can find me all that I want.\a146\a160\a148\a147What did you tell him, then?\a148\a147Any stuff I could make up.\a148\a147How do you know he wasn\a146t a newspaper man?\a148\a147I\a146ll tell you. He got out at Hobson\a146s Patch, and so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.\a147\a160\a145See here,\a146 said the operator after he\a146d gone out, \a145I guess we should charge double rates for this.\a146\a151\a145I guess you should,\a146 said I. He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we could make of it. \a145He fires a sheet of this off every day,\a146 said the clerk. \a145Yes,\a146 said I; \a145it\a146s special news for his paper, and he\a146s scared that the others should tap it.&#8217. That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think differently now.\a148\a147By Gar. I believe you are right,\a148 said McGinty. \a147But what do you allow that we should do about it?\a148\a147Why not go right down now and fix him?\a148 someone suggested.\a147Ay, the sooner the better.\a148\a147I\a146d start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,\a148 said McMurdo. \a147He\a146s in Hobson\a146s Patch; but I don\a146t know the house. I\a146ve got a plan, though, if you\a146ll only take my advice.\a148\a147Well, what is it?\a148\a147I\a146ll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I\a146ll find him through the operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I\a146ll tell him that I\a146m a Freeman myself. I\a146ll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price. You bet he\a146ll tumble to it. I\a146ll tell him the papers are at my house, and that it\a146s as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about. He\a146ll see that that\a146s horse sense. Let him come at ten o\a146clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch him sure.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara\a146s is a lonely house. She\a146s as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There\a146s only Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise\a151 and I\a146ll let you know if I do\a151 I\a146d have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o\a146clock. We\a146ll get him in. If ever he gets out alive\a151 well, he can talk of Birdy Edwards\a146s luck for the rest of his days!\a148\a147There\a146s going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton\a146s or I\a146m mistaken. Leave it at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we\a146ll be with you. You once get the door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.\a148\p\BChapter 7\B - \X2\BThe Trapping of Birdy Edwards\B\X2As McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned. It was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road. In any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as they had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body; but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers.It was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done. If that was indeed so, they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it. But they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective\a146s knowledge, as otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him. However, all this they would learn from his own lips. Once in their power, they would find a way to make him speak. It was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness.McMurdo went to Hobson\a146s Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin\a151 he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago\a151 actually addressed him as he waited at the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to speak with him. He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union House.\a147He is coming,\a148 he said.\a147Good!\a148 said McGinty. The giant was in his shirt sleeves, with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before.\a147Do you reckon he knows much?\a148 he asked anxiously.McMurdo shook his head gloomily. \a147He\a146s been here some time\a151 six weeks at the least. I guess he didn\a146t come into these parts to look at the prospect. If he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results, and that he has passed them on.\a148\a147There\a146s not a weak man in the lodge,\a148 cried McGinty. \a147True as steel, every man of them. And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. What about him. If any man gives us away, it would be he. I\a146ve a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him.\a148\a147Well, there would be no harm in that,\a148 McMurdo answered. \a147I won\a146t deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm. He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though he may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that squeals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.\a148\a147I\a146ll fix the old devil!\a148 said McGinty with an oath. \a147I\a146ve had my eye on him this year past.\a148\a147Well, you know best about that,\a148 McMurdo answered. \a147But whatever you do must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is settled up. We can\a146t afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all days.\a148\a147True for you,\a148 said McGinty. \a147And we\a146ll learn from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first. Did he seem to scent a trap?\a148McMurdo laughed. \a147I guess I took him on his weak point,\a148 he said. \a147If he could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he\a146s ready to follow it into hell. I took his money,\a148 McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes, \a147and as much more when he has seen all my papers.\a148\a147What papers?\a148\a147Well, there are no papers. But I filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership. He expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves.\a148\a147Faith, he\a146s right there,\a148 said McGinty grimly. \a147Didn\a146t he ask you why you didn\a146t bring him the papers?\a148\a147As if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!\a148\a147Ay, I heard of that,\a148 said McGinty. \a147I guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when we\a146ve done with him; but however we work it we can\a146t get past the man living at Hobson\a146s Patch and you being there to-day.\a148McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \a147If we handle it right, they can never prove the killing,\a148 said he. \a147No one can see him come to the house after dark, and I\a146ll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see here, Councillor, I\a146ll show you my plan and I\a146ll ask you to fit the others into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then I\a146ll get behind him and shut it. He\a146s our man then.\a148\a147That\a146s all easy and plain.\a148\a147Yes; but the next step wants considering. He\a146s a hard proposition. He\a146s heavily armed. I\a146ve fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be on his guard. Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone. There is going to be shooting, and somebody is going to be hurt.\a148\a147That\a146s so.\a148\a147And the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it.\a148\a147I guess you are right.\a148\a147This is how I should work it. You will all be in the big room\a151 same as you saw when you had a chat with me. I\a146ll open the door for him, show him into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get the papers. That will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping. Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm. You\a146ll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But I allow that I can hold him till you come.\a148\a147It\a146s a good plan,\a148 said McGinty. \a147The lodge will owe you a debt for this. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man that\a146s coming after me.\a148\a147Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,\a148 said McMurdo; but his face showed what he thought of the great man\a146s compliment.When he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith & Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the centre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were windows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which drew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly what was intended.\a147And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep clear of it. There will be bloody work here before morning.\a148\a147Well, indeed then, Mac,\a148 Scanlan answered. \a147It\a146s not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I\a146m not made for it, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse of me, I\a146ll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening.\a148The men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly respectable citizens, well clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read little hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes. There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before. They were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep.Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the formidable Boss. Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man with a long, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned, and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter, was a middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky expression, and a yellow parchment skin. He was a capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with determined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition. These were the men who assembled that night under the roof of McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.Their host had placed whisky upon the table, and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were already half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity. Cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant\a151 it had been lighted, for the nights were still cold.\a147That will do,\a148 said he, with an oath.\a147Ay,\a148 said Baldwin, catching his meaning. \a147If he is strapped to that, we will have the truth out of him.\a148\a147We\a146ll have the truth out of him, never fear,\a148 said McMurdo. He had nerves of steel, this man; for though the whole weight of the affair was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. The others marked it and applauded.\a147You are the one to handle him,\a148 said the Boss approvingly. \a147Not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat. It\a146s a pity there are no shutters to your windows.\a148McMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter. \a147Sure no one can spy upon us now. It\a146s close upon the hour.\a148\a147Maybe he won\a146t come. Maybe he\a146ll get a sniff of danger,\a148 said the secretary.\a147He\a146ll come, never fear,\a148 McMurdo answered. \a147He is as eager to come as you can be to see him. Hark to that!\a148They all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.\a147Hush!\a148 McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went round the circle, and hands were laid upon their weapons.\a147Not a sound, for your lives!\a148 McMurdo whispered, as he went from the room, closing the door carefully behind him.With strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of their comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer door. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey was safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth.\a147Be quiet, you fool!\a148 he whispered. \a147You\a146ll be the undoing of us yet!\a148There was a mutter of conversation from the next room. It seemed interminable. Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger upon his lip.He came to the end of the table and looked round at them. A subtle change had come over him. His manner was as of one who has great work to do. His face had set into granite firmness. His eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles. He had become a visible leader of men. They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing. Still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man.\a147Well!\a148 cried Boss McGinty at last. \a147Is he here. Is Birdy Edwards here?\a148\a147Yes,\a148 McMurdo answered slowly. \a147Birdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!\a148There were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty, so profound was the silence. The hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set motionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while the curtains were torn from their hangings.At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind the sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair.\a147You\a146re safer there, Councillor,\a148 said the man whom they had known as McMurdo. \a147And you, Baldwin, if you don\a146t take your hand off your pistol, you\a146ll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that made me\a151 There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have. Take their pistols, Marvin!\a148There was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The men were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round the table.\a147I\a146d like to say a word to you before we separate,\a148 said the man who had trapped them. \a147I guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse. I\a146ll give you something to think over between now and then. You know me now for what I am. At last I can put my cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton\a146s. I was chosen to break up your gang. I had a hard and dangerous game to play. Not a soul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing it. Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. But it\a146s over to-night, thank God, and I am the winner!\a148The seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. There was unappeasable hatred in their eyes. He read the relentless threat.\a147Maybe you think that the game is not over yet. Well, I take my chance of that. Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. I\a146ll tell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there was such a society as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I would prove it so. They told me it was to do with the Freemen; so I went to Chicago and was made one. Then I was surer than ever that it was just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of good.\a147Still, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys. When I reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn\a146t a dime novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never killed a man in Chicago. I never minted a dollar in my life. Those I gave you were as good as any others; but I never spent money better. But I knew the way into your good wishes and so I pretended to you that the law was after me. It all worked just as I thought.\a147So I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my share in your councils. Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, so long as I get you. But what is the truth. The night I joined you beat up old man Stanger. I could not warn him, for there was no time; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they were things which I knew I could prevent. I could not save Dunn and Menzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers are hanged. I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a crime that I could not stop; but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out, you\a146ll see my work.\a148\a147You blasted traitor!\a148 hissed McGinty through his closed teeth.\a147Ay, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it. You call me a traitor; but I guess there\a146s many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I\a146ve had three months of it. I wouldn\a146t have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it all, every man and every secret right here in this hand. I\a146d have waited a little longer if it hadn\a146t come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all. Then I had to act and act quickly.\a147I\a146ve nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I\a146ll die the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley. Now, Marvin, I\a146ll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.\a148There is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift, unbroken journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that ever either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days later they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the wedding.The trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. In vain they struggled. In vain the money of the lodge\a151 money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside\a151 was spent like water in the attempt to save them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many years they were broken and scattered. The cloud was lifted forever from the valley.McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the last hour came. Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment. The work of Birdy Edwards was complete.And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. There was another hand to be played, and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin, for one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang. For ten years they were out of the world, and then came a day when they were free once more\a151 a day which Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his life of peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. And well they strove to keep their vow. From Chicago he was chased, after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him. From Chicago he went under a changed name to California, and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly killed, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely canon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a fortune. At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more, and he cleared\a151 only just in time\a151 for England. And thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.EpilogueThe police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was referred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he was acquitted as having acted in self-defence.\a147Get him out of England at any cost,\a148 wrote Holmes to the wife. \a147There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped. There is no safety for your husband in England.\a148Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box. \a147Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!\a148 said this singular epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.\a147devilry, Watson!\a148 he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Mr. Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and haggard.\a147I\a146ve had bad news\a151 terrible news, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he.\a147I feared as much,\a148 said Holmes.\a147You have not had a cable, have you?\a148\a147I have had a note from someone who has.\a148\a147It\a146s poor Douglas. They tell me his name is Edwards; but he will always be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they started together for South Africa in the \iPalmyra\i three weeks ago.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147The ship reached Cape Town last night. I received this cable from Mrs. Douglas this morning:Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St. Helena. No one knows how accident occurred.IVY DOUGLAS.\a148\a147Ha! It came like that, did it?\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully. \a147Well, I\a146ve no doubt it was well stage-managed.\a148\a147You mean that you think there was no accident?\a148\a147None in the world.\a148\a147He was murdered?\a148\a147Surely!\a148\a147So I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest of criminals\a151\a148\a147No, no, my good sir,\a148 said Holmes. \a147There is a master hand here. It is no case of sawed-off shotguns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty when I see one. This crime is from London, not from America.\a148\a147But for what motive?\a148\a147Because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail, one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man. It is crushing the nut with the triphammer\a151 an absurd extravagance of energy\a151 but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same.\a148\a147How came this man to have anything to do with it?\a148\a147I can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants. These Americans were well advised. Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as any foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. From that moment their man was doomed. At first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim. Then he would indicate how the matter might be treated. Finally, when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a master touch. You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger was greater than the past. Was I right?\a148Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger. \a147Do not tell me that we have to sit down under this. Do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil?\a148\a147No, I don\a146t say that,\a148 said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future. \a147I don\a146t say that he can\a146t be beat. But you must give me time\a151 you must give me time!\a148We all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil.\p\c\l\B\X0The Case Book Of Sherlock Holmes\B\X0\BBy Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\c\p\X1\lThe Mazarin Stone\B\X1\c\i\m="maza-02.png"\i\cIt was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective.\a147It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don\a146t change, either. I hope the same can be said of him?\a148Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom.\a147I think he\a146s in bed and asleep,\a148 he said.It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer\a146s day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend\a146s hours to feel no surprise at the idea.\a147That means a case, I suppose?\a148\a147Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I\a146m frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. \a145When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?\a146 Mrs. Hudson asked. \a145Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,\a146 said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case.\a148\a147Yes, Billy, I know.\a148\a147He\a146s following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now.\a148 Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. \a147That\a146s part of the old woman\a146s outfit,\a148 he said.\a147But what is it all about, Billy?\a148Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. \a147I don\a146t mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It\a146s this case of the Crown diamond.\a148\a147What\a151 the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?\a148\a147Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere\a151\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147Yes, sir, you know what that means. He\a146s a stiff\a146un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I\a146ve nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can\a146t stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don\a146t believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He\a146d rather he failed.\a148\a147And Mr. Holmes knows it?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.\a148\a147Well, we\a146ll hope he won\a146t fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We\a146ve got something funny behind it.\a148Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window.Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air.\a147We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more lifelike. I wouldn\a146t dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it\a146s up you can see this from across the way.\a148\a147We used something of the sort once before.\a148\a147Before my time,\a148 said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. \a147There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself.\a148Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more.\a147That will do, Billy,\a148 said he. \a147You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can\a146t do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment.\a148\a147So I gather.\a148\a147You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?\a148\a147Danger of what, Holmes?\a148\a147Of sudden death. I\a146m expecting something this evening.\a148\a147Expecting what?\a148\a147To be murdered, Watson.\a148\a147No, no, you are joking, Holmes!\a148\a147Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days.\a148\a147But why not eat?\a148\a147Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.\a148\a147But this danger, Holmes?\a148\a147Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name\a151 Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N. W. Got it?\a148Watson\a146s honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.\a147Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two.\a148\a147Your morals don\a146t improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.\a148\a147Not such important ones. But can\a146t you have this fellow arrested?\a148\a147Yes, Watson, I could. That\a146s what worries him so.\a148\a147But why don\a146t you?\a148\a147Because I don\a146t know where the diamond is.\a148\a147Ah! Billy told me\a151 the missing Crown jewel!\a148\a147Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I\a146ve cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It\a146s the stone I want.\a148\a147And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?\a148\a147Yes, and he\a146s a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam\a146s not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same.\a148\a147Where is this Count Sylvius?\a148\a147I\a146ve been at his very elbow all the morning. You\a146ve seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. \a145By your leave, madame,\a146 said he\a151 half-ltalian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.\a148\a147It might have been tragedy.\a148\a147Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee\a146s workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun\a151 a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?\a148The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.\a147The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.\a148\a147Send for the police.\a148\a147I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?\a148Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.\a147Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.\a148\a147That will be Sam Merton\a151 the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?\a148\a147In the waiting-room, sir.\a148\a147Show him up when I ring.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion.\a147Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you.\a148\a147I should not be surprised.\a148\a147I insist upon staying with you.\a148\a147You would be horribly in the way.\a148\a147In his way?\a148\a147No, my dear fellow\a151 in my way.\a148\a147Well, I can\a146t possibly leave you.\a148\a147Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.\a148Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. \a147Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C. I. D. Come back with the police. The fellow\a146s arrest will follow.\a148\a147I\a146ll do that with joy.\a147Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is.\a148 He touched the bell. \a147I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.\a148It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:\a147Don\a146t break it, Count! Don\a146t break it!\a148The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.\a147It\a146s a pretty little thing,\a148 said Holmes, advancing towards the image. \a147Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.\a148\a147Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?\a148\a147Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes\a146 chat with you. \a148The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.\a147I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won\a146t deny that I intended to assault you just now.\a148Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.\a147I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,\a148 said he. \a147But why these personal attentions?\a148\a147Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track.\a148\a147My creatures! I assure you no!\a148\a147Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes.\a148\a147It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues\a146 gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.\a148\a147Well, \iMr\i Holmes, then.\a148\a147Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.\a148Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.\a147Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day.\a148\a147Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise?\a148\a147It was you\a151 you yourself?\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders. \a147You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect.\a148\a147If I had known, you might never\a151\a148\a147Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!\a148The Count\a146s knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. \a147What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why?\a148\a147Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria.\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147But why?\a148\a147Why? The sport\a151 the excitement\a151 the danger!\a148\a147And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?\a148\a147Exactly!\a148\a147My reasons in a nutshell!\a148The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.\a147Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond!\a148Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.\a147Upon my word!\a148 said he.\a147You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.\a148\a147Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?\a148\a147Where the Crown diamond now is.\a148The Count looked sharply at his companion. \a147Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?\a148\a147You can, and you will.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148\a147You can\a146t bluff me, Count Sylvius.\a148 Holmes\a146s eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. \a147You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind.\a148\a147Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!\a148Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. \a147Then you do know. You have admitted it!\a148\a147I admit nothing.\a148\a147Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not, you will get hurt.\a148Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. \a147And you talk about bluff!\a148 said he.Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook.\a147Do you know what I keep in this book?\a148\a147No, sir, I do not!\a148\a147You!\a148\a147Me!\a148\a147Yes, sir, you! You are all here\a151 every action of your vile and dangerous life.\a148\a147Damn you, Holmes!\a148 cried the Count with blazing eyes. \a147There are limits to my patience!\a148\a147It\a146s all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.\a148\a147You are dreaming!\a148\a147And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.\a148\a147Tut! You will make nothing of that!\a148\a147Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged cheque in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.\a148\a147No, you\a146re wrong there.\a148\a147Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.\a148\a147What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?\a148\a147Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.\a148\a147Indeed!\a148\a147I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up.\a148The veins stood out on the Count\a146s forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.\a147That\a146s the hand I play from,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I put it all upon the table. But one card is missing. It\a146s the king of diamonds. I don\a146t know where the stone is.\a148\a147You never shall know.\a148\a147No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over\a151 well, I\a146ll compound a felony. We don\a146t want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.\a148\a147But if I refuse?\a148\a147Why, then\a151 alas!\a151 it must be you and not the stone.\a148Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.\a147I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up.\a148\a147If he won\a146t come, sir?\a148\a147No violence, Billy. Don\a146t be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.\a148\a147What are you going to do now?\a148 asked the Count as Billy disappeared.\a147My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together.\a148The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown.\a147You won\a146t die in your bed, Holmes.\a148\a147I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?\a148A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes\a146s figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready.\a147It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,\a148 he said in a quiet voice. \a147You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?\a148The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes\a146s debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help.\a147What\a146s the game now, Count? What\a146s this fellow want? What\a146s up?\a148 His voice was deep and raucous.The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered.\a147If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all up.\a148The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.\a147Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I\a146m not in the funny mood myself.\a148\a147No, I expect not,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I\a146m a busy man and I can\a146t waste time. I\a146m going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman \a145Barcarole\a146 upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?\a148Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.\a147What is it, then?\a148 asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him. \a147Does he know about the stone?\a148\a147He knows a damned sight too much about it. I\a146m not sure that he doesn\a146t know all about it.\a148\a147Good Lord!\a148 The boxer\a146s sallow face turned a shade whiter.\a147Ikey Sanders has split on us.\a148\a147He has, has he? I\a146ll do him down a thick \a146un for that if I swing for it.\a148\a147That won\a146t help us much. We\a146ve got to make up our minds what to do.\a148\a147Half a mo\a146,\a148 said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. \a147He\a146s a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he\a146s not listening?\a148\a147How can he be listening with that music going?\a148\a147That\a146s right. Maybe somebody\a146s behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room.\a148 As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words.\a147Tut! it\a146s only a dummy,\a148 said the Count.\a147A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain\a146t in it. It\a146s the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains Count!\a148\a147Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone.\a148\a147The deuce he can!\a148\a147But he\a146ll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.\a148\a147What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?\a148\a147It\a146s one or the other.\a148Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.\a147He\a146s alone in there. Let\a146s do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.\a148The Count shook his head.\a147He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it\a146s likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?\a148There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.\a147Something in the street,\a148 said Merton. \a147Now look here, guv\a146nor, you\a146ve got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it\a146s up to you.\a148\a147I\a146ve fooled better men than he,\a148 the Count answered. \a147The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.\a148\a147I thought Van Seddar was going next week.\a148\a147He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.\a148\a147But the false bottom ain\a146t ready.\a148\a147Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There\a146s not a moment to lose.\a148 Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.\a147As to Holmes,\a148 he continued, \a147we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won\a146t arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we\a146ll promise him the stone. We\a146ll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country.\a148\a147That sounds good to me!\a148 cried Sam Merton with a grin.\a147You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I\a146ll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I\a146ll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn\a146t in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.\a148\a147I wonder you dare carry it.\a148\a147Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.\a148\a147Let\a146s have a look at it.\a148Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.\a147What\a151 d\a146ye think I\a146m going to snatch it off you? See here, mister, I\a146m getting a bit tired of your ways.\a148\a147Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can\a146t afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here!\a148\a147Thank you!\a148With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy\a146s chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count\a146s head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.\a147No violence, gentlemen\a151 no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below.\a148The Count\a146s bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.\a147But how the deuce\a151?\a148 he gasped.\a147Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.\a148The Count gave a gesture of resignation.\a147We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.\a148\a147Not far from him, at any rate,\a148 Holmes answered with a polite smile.Sam Merton\a146s slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last.\a147A fair cop!\a148 said he. \a147But, I say, what about that bloomin\a146 fiddle! I hear it yet.\a148\a147Tut, tut!\a148 Holmes answered. \a147You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.\a148There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.\a147Lord Cantlemere sir.\a148\a147Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.\a148The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.\a147How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?\a148\a147No, I thank you; I will not take it off.\a148Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.\a147Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.\a148His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.\a147I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.\a148\a147It is difficult\a151 very difficult.\a148\a147I feared that you would find it so.\a148There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier\a146s words and manner.\a147Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.\a148\a147Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.\a148\a147No doubt.\a148\a147Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon\a147You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you.\a148\a147You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.\a148\a147When you have caught them.\a148\a147Exactly. But the question is\a151 how shall we proceed against the receiver?\a148\a147Is this not rather premature?\a148\a147It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?\a148\a147The actual possession of the stone.\a148\a147You would arrest him upon that?\a148\a147Most undoubtedly.\a148Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember.\a147In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.\a148Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks.\a147You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.\a148Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door.\a147One moment, sir,\a148 said he. \a147To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.\a148\a147Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.\a148\a147Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.\a148\a147What do you mean, sir?\a148\a147Come\a151 come, do what I ask.\a148An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.\a147What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!\a148 cried Holmes. \a147My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty\a151 the very great liberty, I admit\a151 of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.\a148The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.\a147Sir, I am bewildered. But\a151 yes\a151 it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how\a151\a148\a147The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.\a148\p\X1\BThor Bridge\B\X1\c\i\m="thor-07.png" \i\cSomewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatchbox with my name, John H. Watson, M. D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader. Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world. No less remarkable is that of the cutter Alicia, which sailed one spring morning into a small patch of mist from where she never again emerged, nor was anything further ever heard of herself and her crew. A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science. Apart from these unfathomed cases, there are some which involve the secrets of private families to an extent which would mean consternation in many exalted quarters if it were thought possible that they might find their way into print. I need not say that such a breach of confidence is unthinkable, and that these records will be separated and destroyed now that my friend has time to turn his energies to the matter. There remain a considerable residue of cases of greater or less interest which I might have edited before had I not feared to give the public a surfeit which might react upon the reputation of the man whom above all others I revere. In some I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye-witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person. The following narrative is drawn from my own experience.It was a wild morning in October, and I observed as I was dressing how the last remaining leaves were being whirled from the solitary plane tree which graces the yard behind our house. I descended to breakfast prepared to find my companion in depressed spirits, for, like all great artists, he was easily impressed by his surroundings. On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter moments.\a147You have a case, Holmes?\a148 I remarked.\a147The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson,\a148 he answered. \a147It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case. After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once more.\a148\a147Might I share it?\a148\a147There is little to share, but we may discuss it when you have consumed the two hard-boiled eggs with which our new cook has favoured us. Their condition may not be unconnected with the copy of the Family Herald which I observed yesterday upon the hall-table. Even so trivial a matter as cooking an egg demands an attention which is conscious of the passage of time and incompatible with the love romance in that excellent periodical.\a148A quarter of an hour later the table had been cleared and we were face to face. He had drawn a letter from his pocket.\a147You have heard of Neil Gibson, the Gold King?\a148 he said.\a147You mean the American Senator?\a148\a147Well, he was once Senator for some Western state, but is better known as the greatest gold-mining magnate in the world.\a148\a147Yes, I know of him. He has surely lived in England for some time. His name is very familiar.\a148\a147Yes, he bought a considerable estate in Hampshire some five years ago. Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?\a148\a147Of course. I remember it now. That is why the name is familiar. But I really know nothing of the details.\a148Holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. \a147I had no idea that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts ready,\a148 said he. \a147The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner\a146s jury and also in the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts, Watson, but I cannot change them. Unless some entirely new and unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope for.\a148\a147Your client?\a148\a147Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved habit, Watson, of telling a story backward. You had best read this first.\a148T\the letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand, ran as follows:\tC\tLARIDGE\a146S HOTEL,\tO\tctober 3rd.\tD\tEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\tI\t can\a146t see the best woman God ever made go to her death without doing all that is possible to save her. I can\a146t explain things\a151 I can\a146t even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss Dunbar is innocent. You know the facts\a151 who doesn\a146t? It has been the gossip of the country. And never a voice raised for her! It\a146s the damned injustice of it all that makes me crazy. That woman has a heart that wouldn\a146t let her kill a fly. Well, I\a146ll come at eleven to-morrow and see if you can get some ray of light in the dark. Maybe I have a clue and don\a146t know it. Anyhow, all I know and all I have and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. If ever in your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case.\tY\tours faithfully,\tJ\t. NEIL GIBSON. \t\a147There you have it,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. \a147That is the gentleman I await. As to the story, you have hardly time to master all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. This man is the greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of most violent and formidable character. He married a wife, the victim of this tragedy, of whom I know nothing save that she was past her prime, which was the more unfortunate as a very attractive governess superintended the education of two young children. These are the three people concerned, and the scene is a grand old manor house, the centre of a historical English state. Then as to the tragedy. The wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders and a revolver bullet through her brain. No weapon was found near her and there was no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near her, Watson\a151 mark that! The crime seems to have been committed late in the evening, and the body was found by a gamekeeper about eleven o\a146clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before being carried up to the house. Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?\a148\a147It is all very clear. But why suspect the governess?\a148\a147Well, in the first place there is some very direct evidence. A revolver with one discharged chamber and a calibre which corresponded with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe.\a148 His eyes fixed and he repeated in broken words, \a147On\a151 the\a151 floor\a151 of\a151 her\a151 wardrobe.\a148 Then he sank into silence, and I saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk life once more. \a147Yes, Watson, it was found. Pretty damning, eh? So the two juries thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon her making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess. How\a146s that? Finally there is the motive. Senator Gibson is an attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing attentions from her employer? Love, fortune, power, all depending upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson\a151 very ugly!\a148\a147Yes, indeed, Holmes.\a148\a147Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that she was down near Thor Bridge\a151 that was the scene of the tragedy\a151 about that hour. She couldn\a146t deny it, for some passing villager had seen her there.\a148\a147That really seems final.\a148\a147And yet, Watson\a151 and yet! This bridge\a151 a single broad span of stone with balustraded sides\a151 carries the drive over the narrowest part of a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it is called. In the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. Such are the main facts. But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his time.\a148Billy had opened the door, but the name which he announced was an unexpected one. Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching, hesitating manner\a151 a man whom my own professional eye would judge to be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.\a147You seem agitated, Mr. Bates,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Pray sit down. I fear I can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven.\a148\a147I know you have,\a148 our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences like a man who is out of breath. \a147Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is my employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes, he is a villain\a151 an infernal villain.\a148\a147Strong language, Mr. Bates.\a148\a147I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited. I would not have him find me here for the world. He is almost due now. But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. His secretary, Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you.\a148\a147And you are his manager?\a148\a147I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his accursed slavery. A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about him. Those public charities are a screen to cover his private iniquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was brutal to her\a151 yes, sir, brutal! How she came by her death I do not know, but I am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. She was a creature of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know.\a148\a147No, it had escaped me.\a148\a147Tropical by birth and tropical by nature. A child of the sun and of passion. She had loved him as such women can love, but when her own physical charms had faded\a151 I am told that they once were great\a151 there was nothing to hold him. We all liked her and felt for her and hated him for the way that he treated her. But he is plausible and cunning. That is all I have to say to you. Don\a146t take him at his face value. There is more behind. Now I\a146ll go. No, no, don\a146t detain me! He is almost due.\a148With a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran to the door and disappeared.\a147Well! Well!\a148 said Holmes after an interval of silence. \a147Mr. Gibson seems to have a nice loyal household. But the warning is a useful one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears.\a148Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs, and the famous millionaire was shown into the room. As I looked upon him I understood not only the fears and dislike of his manager but also the execrations which so many business rivals have heaped upon his head. If I were a sculptor and desired to idealize the successful man of affairs, iron of nerve and leathery of conscience, I should choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my model. His tall, gaunt, craggy figure had a suggestion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. His face might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless, with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. Cold gray eyes, looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in turn. He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.\a147Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he began, \a147that money is nothing to me in this case. You can burn it if it\a146s any use in lighting you to the truth. This woman is innocent and this woman has to be cleared, and it\a146s up to you to do it. Name your figure!\a148\a147My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,\a148 said Holmes coldly. \a147I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.\a148\a147Well, if dollars make no difference to you, think of the reputation. If you pull this off every paper in England and America will be booming you. You\a146ll be the talk of two continents.\a148\a147Thank you, Mr. Gibson, I do not think that I am in need of booming. It may surprise you to know that I prefer to work anonymously, and that it is the problem itself which attracts me. But we are wasting time. Let us get down to the facts.\a148\a147I think that you will find all the main ones in the press reports. I don\a146t know that I can add anything which will help you. But if there is anything you would wish more light upon\a151 well, I am here to give it.\a148\a147Well, there is just one point.\a148\a147What is it?\a148\a147What were the exact relations between you and Miss Dunbar?\a148The Gold King gave a violent start and half rose from his chair. Then his massive calm came back to him.\a147I suppose you are within your rights\a151 and maybe doing your duty\a151 in asking such a question, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147We will agree to suppose so,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always those of an employer towards a young lady whom he never conversed with, or ever saw, save when she was in the company of his children.\a148Holmes rose from his chair.\a147I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson,\a148 said he, \a147and I have no time or taste for aimless conversations. I wish you good morning.\a148Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above Holmes. There was an angry gleam from under those bristling brows and a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.\a147What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my case?\a148\a147Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my words were plain.\a148\a147Plain enough, but what\a146s at the back of it? Raising the price on me, or afraid to tackle it, or what? I\a146ve a right to a plain answer.\a148\a147Well, perhaps you have,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I\a146ll give you one. This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.\a148\a147Meaning that I lie.\a148\a147Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.\a148I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire\a146s face was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted fist. Holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe.\a147Don\a146t be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after breakfast even the smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your advantage.\a148With an effort the Gold King mastered his fury. I could not but admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.\a147Well, it\a146s your choice. I guess you know how to run your own business. I can\a146t make you touch the case against your will. You\a146ve done yourself no good this morning, Mr. Holmes, for I have broken stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me and was the better for it.\a148\a147So many have said so, and yet here I am,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147Well, good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You have a good deal yet to learn.\a148Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.\a147Any views, Watson?\a148 he asked at last.\a147Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me\a151\a148\a147Exactly. And to me also.\a148\a147But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you discover them?\a148\a147Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the passionate, unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman rather than upon the victim. We\a146ve got to understand the exact relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. You saw the frontal attack which I made upon him, and how imperturbably he received it. Then I bluffed him by giving him the impression that I was absolutely certain, when in reality I was only extremely suspicious.\a148\a147Perhaps he will come back?\a148\a147He is sure to come back. He must come back. He can\a146t leave it where it is. Ha! isn\a146t that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr. Gibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat overdue.\a148The Gold King had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes, but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would attain his end.\a147I\a146ve been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been hasty in taking your remarks amiss. You are justified in getting down to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for it. I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar and me don\a146t really touch this case.\a148\a147That is for me to decide, is it not?\a148\a147Yes, I guess that is so. You\a146re like a surgeon who wants every symptom before he can give his diagnosis.\a148\a147Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a patient who has an object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his case.\a148\a147That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations with a woman may be\a151 if there is really some serious feeling in the case. I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in some corner of their souls where they don\a146t welcome intruders. And you burst suddenly into it. But the object excuses you, since it was to try and save her. Well, the stakes are down and the reserve open, and you can explore where you will. What is it you want?\a148\a147The truth.\a148The Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts. His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.\a147I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he at last. \a147There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to say, so I won\a146t go deeper than is needful. I met my wife when I was gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto was the daughter of a government official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood and a more critical eye, I can see that she was rare and wonderful in her beauty. It was a deep rich nature, too, passionate, whole-hearted, tropical, ill-balanced, very different from the American women whom I had known. Well, to make a long story short, I loved her and I married her. It was only when the romance had passed\a151 and it lingered for years\a151 that I realized that we had nothing\a151 absolutely nothing\a151 in common. My love faded. If hers had faded also it might have been easier. But you know the wonderful way of women! Do what I might, nothing could turn her from me. If I have been harsh to her, even brutal as some have said, it has been because I knew that if I could kill her love, or if it turned to hate, it would be easier for both of us. But nothing changed her. She adored me in those English woods as she had adored me twenty years ago on the banks of the Amazon. Do what I might, she was as devoted as ever.\a147Then came Miss Grace Dunbar. She answered our advertisement and became governess to our two children. Perhaps you have seen her portrait in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed that she also is a very beautiful woman. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her without feeling a passionate regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I do not blame you for feeling it. I should blame you if you expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your protection.\a148\a147Well, maybe so,\a148 said the millionaire, though for a moment the reproof had brought the old angry gleam into his eyes. \a147I\a146m not pretending to be any better than I am. I guess all my life I\a146ve been a man that reached out his hand for what he wanted, and I never wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. I told her so.\a148\a147Oh, you did, did you?\a148Holmes could look very formidable when he was moved.\a147I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out of my power. I said that money was no object and that all I could do to make her happy and comfortable would be done.\a148\a147Very generous, I am sure,\a148 said Holmes with a sneer.\a147See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a question of evidence, not on a question of morals. I\a146m not asking for your criticism.\a148\a147It is only for the young lady\a146s sake that I touch your case at all,\a148 said Holmes sternly. \a147I don\a146t know that anything she is accused of is really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. Some of you rich men have to be taught that all the world cannot be bribed into condoning your offences.\a148To my surprise the Gold King took the reproof with equanimity.\a147That\a146s how I feel myself about it now. I thank God that my plans did not work out as I intended. She would have none of it, and she wanted to leave the house instantly.\a148\a147Why did she not?\a148\a147Well, in the first place, others were dependent upon her, and it was no light matter for her to let them all down by sacrificing her living. When I had sworn\a151 as I did\a151 that she should never be molested again, she consented to remain. But there was another reason. She knew the influence she had over me, and that it was stronger than any other influence in the world. She wanted to use it for good.\a148\a147How?\a148\a147Well, she knew something of my affairs. They are large, Mr. Holmes\a151 large beyond the belief of an ordinary man. I can make or break\a151 and it is usually break. It wasn\a146t individuals only. It was communities, cities, even nations. Business is a hard game, and the weak go to the wall. I played the game for all it was worth. I never squealed myself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But she saw it different. I guess she was right. She believed and said that a fortune for one man that was more than he needed should not be built on ten thousand ruined men who were left without the means of life. That was how she saw it, and I guess she could see past the dollars to something that was more lasting. She found that I listened to what she said, and she believed she was serving the world by influencing my actions. So she stayed\a151 and then this came along.\a148\a147Can you throw any light upon that?\a148The Gold King paused for a minute or more, his head sunk in his hands, lost in deep thought.\a147It\a146s very black against her. I can\a146t deny that. And women lead an inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man. At first I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against her usual nature. One explanation came into my head. I give it to you, Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous. There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause\a151 and I think she understood this\a151 for the latter, she was aware that this English girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself never had. It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the matter. She was crazy with hatred and the heat of the Amazon was always in her blood. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar\a151 or we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into leaving us. Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off and shot the woman who held it.\a148\a147That possibility had already occurred to me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Indeed, it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder.\a148\a147But she utterly denies it.\a148\a147Well, that is not final\a151 is it? One can understand that a woman placed in so awful a position might hurry home still in her bewilderment holding the revolver. She might even throw it down among her clothes, hardly knowing what she was doing, and when it was found she might try to lie her way out by a total denial, since all explanation was impossible. What is against such a supposition?\a148\a147Miss Dunbar herself.\a148\a147Well, perhaps.\a148Holmes looked at his watch. \a147I have no doubt we can get the necessary permits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train. When I have seen this young lady it is very possible that I may be of more use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions will necessarily be such as you desire.\a148There was some delay in the official pass, and instead of reaching Winchester that day we went down to Thor Place, the Hampshire estate of Mr. Neil Gibson. He did not accompany us himself, but we had the address of Sergeant Coventry, of the local police, who had first examined into the affair. He was a tall, thin, cadaverous man, with a secretive and mysterious manner which conveyed the idea that he knew or suspected a very great deal more than he dared say. He had a trick, too, of suddenly sinking his voice to a whisper as if he had come upon something of vital importance, though the information was usually commonplace enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.\a147Anyhow, I\a146d rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all credit for success and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play straight, so I\a146ve heard.\a148\a147I need not appear in the matter at all,\a148 said Holmes to the evident relief of our melancholy acquaintance. \a147If I can clear it up I don\a146t ask to have my name mentioned.\a148\a147Well, it\a146s very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr. Watson, can be trusted, I know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I\a146d breathe it to no soul but you.\a148 He looked round as though he hardly dare utter the words. \a147Don\a146t you think there might be a case against Mr. Neil Gibson himself?\a148\a147I have been considering that.\a148\a147You\a146ve not seen Miss Dunbar. She is a wonderful fine woman in every way. He may well have wished his wife out of the road. And these Americans are readier with pistols than our folk are. It was his pistol, you know.\a148\a147Was that clearly made out?\a148\a147Yes, sir. It was one of a pair that he had.\a148\a147One of a pair? Where is the other?\a148\a147Well, the gentleman has a lot of firearms of one sort and another. We never quite matched that particular pistol\a151 but the box was made for two.\a148\a147If it was one of a pair you should surely be able to match it.\a148\a147Well, we have them all laid out at the house if you would care to look them over.\a148\a147Later, perhaps. I think we will walk down together and have a look at the scene of the tragedy.\a148This conversation had taken place in the little front room of Sergeant Coventry\a146s humble cottage which served as the local police-station. A walk of half a mile or so across a wind-swept heath, all gold and bronze with the fading ferns, brought us to a side-gate opening into the grounds of the Thor Place estate. A path led us through the pheasant preserves, and then from a clearing we saw the widespread, half-timbered house, half Tudor and half Georgian, upon the crest of the hill. Beside us there was a long, reedy pool, constricted in the centre where the main carriage drive passed over a stone bridge, but swelling into small lakes on either side. Our guide paused at the mouth of this bridge, and he pointed to the ground.\a147That was where Mrs. Gibson\a146s body lay. I marked it by that stone.\a148\a147I understand that you were there before it was moved?\a148\a147Yes, they sent for me at once.\a148\a147Who did?\a148\a147Mr. Gibson himself. The moment the alarm was given and he had rushed down with others from the house, he insisted that nothing should be moved until the police should arrive.\a148\a147That was sensible. I gathered from the newspaper report that the shot was fired from close quarters.\a148\a147Yes, sir, very close.\a148\a147Near the right temple?\a148\a147Just behind it, sir.\a148\a147How did the body lie?\a148\a147On the back, sir. No trace of a struggle. No marks. No weapon. The short note from Miss Dunbar was clutched in her left hand.\a148\a147Clutched, you say?\a148\a147Yes, sir, we could hardly open the fingers.\a148\a147\tThat is of great importance. It excludes the idea that anyone could have placed the note there after death in order to furnish a false clue. Dear me! The note, as I remember, was quite short:\tI\t will be at Thor Bridge at nine o\a146clock.\tG\t. DUNBAR. \t\a147Was that not so?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Did Miss Dunbar admit writing it?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147What was her explanation?\a148\a147Her defence was reserved for the Assizes. She would say nothing.\a148\a147The problem is certainly a very interesting one. The point of the letter is very obscure, is it not?\a148\a147Well, sir,\a148 said the guide, \a147it seemed, if I may be so bold as to say so, the only really clear point in the whole case.\a148Holmes shook his head.\a147Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was certainly received some time before\a151 say one hour or two. Why, then, was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer to it in the interview. Does it not seem remarkable?\a148\a147Well, sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.\a148\a147I think I should like to sit quietly for a few minutes and think it out.\a148 He seated himself upon the stone ledge of the bridge, and I could see his quick gray eyes darting their questioning glances in every direction. Suddenly he sprang up again and ran across to the opposite parapet, whipped his lens from his pocket, and began to examine the stonework.\a147This is curious,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, we saw the chip on the ledge. I expect it\a146s been done by some passer-by.\a148The stonework was gray, but at this one point it showed white for a space not larger than a sixpence. When examined closely one could see that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.\a147It took some violence to do that,\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully. With his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark. \a147Yes, it was a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not from above but from below, for you see that it is on the lower edge of the parapet.\a148\a147But it is at least fifteen feet from the body.\a148\a147Yes, it is fifteen feet from the body. It may have nothing to do with the matter, but it is a point worth noting. I do not think that we have anything more to learn here. There were no footsteps, you say?\a148\a147The ground was iron hard, sir. There were no traces at all.\a148\a147Then we can go. We will go up to the house first and look over these weapons of which you speak. Then we shall get on to Winchester, for I should desire to see Miss Dunbar before we go farther.\a148Mr. Neil Gibson had not returned from town, but we saw in the house the neurotic Mr. Bates who had called upon us in the morning. He showed us with a sinister relish the formidable array of firearms of various shapes and sizes which his employer had accumulated in the course of an adventurous life.\a147Mr. Gibson has his enemies, as anyone would expect who knew him and his methods,\a148 said he. \a147He sleeps with a loaded revolver in the drawer beside his bed. He is a man of violence, sir, and there are times when all of us are afraid of him. I am sure that the poor lady who has passed was often terrified.\a148\a147Did you ever witness physical violence towards her?\a148\a147No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as bad\a151 words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants.\a148\a147Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life,\a148 remarked Holmes as we made our way to the station. \a147Well, Watson, we have come on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way from my conclusion. In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr. Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8:30 and all was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in the evening, but the tragedy certainly occurred about the hour named in the note. There is no evidence at all that Mr. Gibson had been out of doors since his return from town at five o\a146clock. On the other hand, Miss Dunbar, as I understand it, admits that she had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gibson at the bridge. Beyond this she would say nothing, as her lawyer had advised her to reserve her defence. We have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind will not be easy until we have seen her. I must confess that the case would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one thing.\a148\a147And what is that, Holmes?\a148\a147The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe.\a148\a147Dear me, Holmes!\a148 I cried, \a147that seemed to me to be the most damning incident of all.\a148\a147Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my first perfunctory reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception.\a148\a147I hardly follow you.\a148\a147Well now, Watson, suppose for a moment that we visualize you in the character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about to get rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has been written. The victim has come. You have your weapon. The crime is done. It has been workmanlike and complete. Do you tell me that after carrying out so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be searched? Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer, Watson, and yet I could not picture you doing anything so crude as that.\a148\a147In the excitement of the moment?\a148\a147No, no, Watson, I will not admit that it is possible. Where a crime is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly premeditated also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of a serious misconception.\a148\a147But there is so much to explain.\a148\a147Well, we shall set about explaining it. When once your point of view is changed, the very thing which was so damning becomes a clue to the truth. For example, there is this revolver. Miss Dunbar disclaims all knowledge of it. On our new theory she is speaking truth when she says so. Therefore, it was placed in her wardrobe. Who placed it there? Someone who wished to incriminate her. Was not that person the actual criminal? You see how we come at once upon a most fruitful line of inquiry.\a148We were compelled to spend the night at Winchester, as the formalities had not yet been completed, but next morning, in the company of Mr. Joyce Cummings, the rising barrister who was entrusted with the defence, we were allowed to see the young lady in her cell. I had expected from all that we had heard to see a beautiful woman, but I can never forget the effect which Miss Dunbar produced upon me. It was no wonder that even the masterful millionaire had found in her something more powerful than himself\a151 something which could control and guide him. One felt, too, as one looked at the strong, clear-cut, and yet sensitive face, that even should she be capable of some impetuous deed, none the less there was an innate nobility of character which would make her influence always for the good. She was a brunette, tall, with a noble figure and commanding presence, but her dark eyes had in them the appealing, helpless expression of the hunted creature who feels the nets around it, but can see no way out from the toils. Now, as she realized the presence and the help of my famous friend, there came a touch of colour in her wan cheeks and a light of hope began to glimmer in the glance which she turned upon us.\a147Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred between us?\a148 she asked in a low, agitated voice.\a147Yes,\a148 Holmes answered, \a147you need not pain yourself by entering into that part of the story. After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr. Gibson\a146s statement both as to the influence which you had over him and as to the innocence of your relations with him. But why was the whole situation not brought out in court?\a148\a147It seemed to me incredible that such a charge could be sustained. I thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the inner life of the family. But I understand that far from clearing it has become even more serious.\a148\a147My dear young lady,\a148 cried Holmes earnestly, \a147I beg you to have no illusions upon the point. Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything that is possible if we are to win clear. It would be a cruel deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. Give me all the help you can, then, to get at the truth.\a148\a147I will conceal nothing.\a148\a147Tell us, then, of your true relations with Mr. Gibson\a146s wife.\a148\a147She hated me, Mr. Holmes. She hated me with all the fervour of her tropical nature. She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her hatred for me. It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. I would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even spiritual, tie which held her husband to me, or imagine that it was only my desire to influence his power to good ends which kept me under his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing could justify me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left the house.\a148\a147Now, Miss Dunbar,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I beg you to tell us exactly what occurred that evening.\a148\a147I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am in a position to prove nothing, and there are points\a151 the most vital points\a151 which I can neither explain nor can I imagine any explanation.\a148\a147If you will find the facts, perhaps others may find the explanation.\a148\a147With regard, then, to my presence at Thor Bridge that night, I received a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning. It lay on the table of the schoolroom, and it may have been left there by her own hand. It implored me to see her there after dinner, said she had something important to say to me, and asked me to leave an answer on the sundial in the garden, as she desired no one to be in our confidence. I saw no reason for such secrecy, but I did as she asked, accepting the appointment. She asked me to destroy her note and I burned it in the schoolroom grate. She was very much afraid of her husband, who treated her with a harshness for which I frequently reproached him, and I could only imagine that she acted in this way because she did not wish him to know of our interview.\a148\a147Yet she kept your reply very carefully?\a148\a147Yes. I was surprised to hear that she had it in her hand when she died.\a148\a147Well, what happened then?\a148\a147I went down as I had promised. When I reached the bridge she was waiting for me. Never did I realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me. She was like a mad woman\a151 indeed, I think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have. How else could she have met me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in her heart? I will not say what she said. She poured her whole wild fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not even answer\a151 I could not. It was dreadful to see her. I put my hands to my ears and rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking out her curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.\a148\a147Where she was afterwards found?\a148\a147Within a few yards from the spot.\a148\a147And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left her, you heard no shot?\a148\a147No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which happened.\a148\a147You say that you returned to your room. Did you leave it again before next morning?\a148\a147Yes, when the alarm came that the poor creature had met her death I ran out with the others.\a148\a147Did you see Mr. Gibson?\a148\a147Yes, he had just returned from the bridge when I saw him. He had sent for the doctor and the police.\a148\a147Did he seem to you much perturbed?\a148\a147Mr. Gibson is a very strong, self-contained man. I do not think that he would ever show his emotions on the surface. But I, who knew him so well, could see that he was deeply concerned.\a148\a147Then we come to the all-important point. This pistol that was found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?\a148\a147Never, I swear it.\a148\a147When was it found?\a148\a147Next morning, when the police made their search.\a148\a147Among your clothes?\a148\a147Yes, on the floor of my wardrobe under my dresses.\a148\a147You could not guess how long it had been there?\a148\a147It had not been there the morning before.\a148\a147How do you know?\a148\a147Because I tidied out the wardrobe.\a148\a147That is final. Then someone came into your room and placed the pistol there in order to inculpate you.\a148\a147It must have been so.\a148\a147And when?\a148\a147It could only have been at meal-time, or else at the hours when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.\a148\a147As you were when you got the note?\a148\a147Yes, from that time onward for the whole morning.\a148\a147Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other point which could help me in the investigation?\a148\a147I can think of none.\a148\a147There was some sign of violence on the stonework of the bridge\a151 a perfectly fresh chip just opposite the body. Could you suggest any possible explanation of that?\a148\a147Surely it must be a mere coincidence.\a148\a147Curious, Miss Dunbar, very curious. Why should it appear at the very time of the tragedy, and why at the very place?\a148\a147But what could have caused it? Only great violence could have such an effect.\a148Holmes did not answer. His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that tense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident was the crisis in his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister, prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous energy and the pressing need for action.\a147Come, Watson, come!\a148 he cried.\a147What is it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make England ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through.\a148It was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness he could not sit still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive fingers upon the cushions beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared our destination he seated himself opposite to me\a151 we had a first-class carriage to ourselves\a151 and laying a hand upon each of my knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.\a147Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I have some recollection that you go armed upon these excursions of ours.\a148It was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem so that more than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him of the fact.\a147Yes, yes, I am a little absent-minded in such matters. But have you your revolver on you?\a148I produced it from my hip-pocket, a short, handy, but very serviceable little weapon. He undid the catch, shook out the cartridges, and examined it with care.\a147It\a146s heavy\a151 remarkably heavy,\a148 said he.\a147Yes, it is a solid bit of work.\a148He mused over it for a minute.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147I believe your revolver is going to have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are investigating.\a148\a147My dear Holmes, you are joking.\a148\a147No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the weight and makes it a better reproduction.\a148I had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor did he enlighten me, but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.\a147A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?\a148\a147It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson\a146s revolver,\a148 said my friend. \a147Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of string?\a148The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.\a147I think that this is all we will need,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, if you please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our journey.\a148The sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a wonderful autumnal panorama. The sergeant, with many critical and incredulous glances, which showed his deep doubts of the sanity of my companion, lurched along beside us. As we approached the scene of the crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was in truth deeply agitated.\a147Yes,\a148 he said in answer to my remark, \a147you have seen me miss my mark before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when first it flashed across my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet\a151 and yet\a151 Well, Watson, we can but try.\a148As he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle of the revolver. We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. With great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the exact spot where the body had been stretched. He then hunted among the heather and the ferns until he found a considerable stone. This he secured to the other end of his line of string, and he hung it over the parapet of the bridge so that it swung clear above the water. He then stood on the fatal spot, some distance from the edge of the bridge, with my revolver in his hand, the string being taut between the weapon and the heavy stone on the farther side.\a147Now for it!\a148 he cried.At the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his grip. In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed that he had found what he expected.\a147Was there ever a more exact demonstration?\a148 he cried. \a147See, Watson, your revolver has solved the problem!\a148 As he spoke he pointed to a second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade.\a147We\a146ll stay at the inn to-night,\a148 he continued as he rose and faced the astonished sergeant. \a147You will, of course, get a grappling-hook and you will easily restore my friend\a146s revolver. You will also find beside it the revolver, string and weight with which this vindictive woman attempted to disguise her own crime and to fasten a charge of murder upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gibson know that I will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss Dunbar\a146s vindication.\a148Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.\a147I fear, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that you will not improve any reputation which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art. I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having attained it sooner.\a147It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman\a146s mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to unravel her plot. I do not think that in our adventures we have ever come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring about. Whether Miss Dunbar was her rival in a physical or in a merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in her eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to repel her too demonstrative affection. Her first resolution was to end her own life. Her second was to do it in such a way as to involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden death could be.\a147We can follow the various steps quite clearly, and they show a remarkable subtlety of mind. A note was extracted very cleverly from Miss Dunbar which would make it appear that she had chosen the scene of the crime. In her anxiety that it should be discovered she somewhat overdid it by holding it in her hand to the last. This alone should have excited my suspicions earlier than it did.\a147Then she took one of her husband\a146s revolvers\a151 there was, as you saw, an arsenal in the house\a151 and kept it for her own use. A similar one she concealed that morning in Miss Dunbar\a146s wardrobe after discharging one barrel, which she could easily do in the woods without attracting attention. She then went down to the bridge where she had contrived this exceedingly ingenious method for getting rid of her weapon. When Miss Dunbar appeared she used her last breath in pouring out her hatred, and then, when she was out of hearing, carried out her terrible purpose. Every link is now in its place and the chain is complete. The papers may ask why the mere was not dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are looking for and where. Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable woman, and also a formidable man. Should they in the future join their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught.\a148\p\X1\BThe Creeping Man\B\X1\c\i\m="cree-02.png"\i\cMr. Sherlock Holmes was always of opinion that I should publish the singular facts connected with Professor Presbury, if only to dispel once for all the ugly rumours which some twenty years ago agitated the university and were echoed in the learned societies of London. There were, however, certain obstacles in the way, and the true history of this curious case remained entombed in the tin box which contains so many records of my friend\a146s adventures. Now we have at last obtained permission to ventilate the facts which formed one of the very last cases handled by Holmes before his retirement from practice. Even now a certain reticence and discretion have to be observed in laying the matter before the public.I\tt was one Sunday evening early in September of the year 1903 that I received one of Holmes\a146s laconic messages:\tC\tome at once if convenient\a151 if inconvenient come all the same. S. H. \tThe relations between us in those latter days were peculiar. He was a man of habits, narrow and concentrated habits, and I had become one of them. As an institution I was like the violin, the shag tobacco, the old black pipe, the index books, and others perhaps less excusable. When it was a case of active work and a comrade was needed upon whose nerve he could place some reliance, my role was obvious. But apart from this I had uses. I was a whetstone for his mind. I stimulated him. He liked to think aloud in my presence. His remarks could hardly be said to be made to me\a151 many of them would have been as appropriately addressed to his bedstead\a151 but none the less, having formed the habit, it had become in some way helpful that I should register and interject. If I irritated him by a certain methodical slowness in my mentality, that irritation served only to make his own flame-like intuitions and impressions flash up the more vividly and swiftly. Such was my humble role in our alliance.When I arrived at Baker Street I found him huddled up in his armchair with updrawn knees, his pipe in his mouth and his brow furrowed with thought. It was clear that he was in the throes of some vexatious problem. With a wave of his hand he indicated my old armchair, but otherwise for half an hour he gave no sign that he was aware of my presence. Then with a start he seemed to come from his reverie, and with his usual whimsical smile he greeted me back to what had once been my home.\a147You will excuse a certain abstraction of mind, my dear Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Some curious facts have been submitted to me within the last twenty-four hours, and they in turn have given rise to some speculations of a more general character. I have serious thoughts of writing a small monograph upon the uses of dogs in the work of the detective.\a148\a147But surely, Holmes, this has been explored,\a148 said I. \a147Bloodhounds\a151 sleuth-hounds\a151\a148\a147No, no, Watson, that side of the matter is, of course, obvious. But there is another which is far more subtle. You may recollect that in the case which you, in your sensational way, coupled with the Copper Beeches, I was able, by watching the mind of the child, to form a deduction as to the criminal habits of the very smug and respectable father.\a148\a147Yes, I remember it well.\a148\a147My line of thoughts about dogs is analogous. A dog reflects the family life. Whoever saw a frisky dog in a gloomy family, or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs, dangerous people have dangerous ones. And their passing moods may reflect the passing moods of others.\a148I shook my head. \a147Surely, Holmes, this is a little far-fetched,\a148 said I.He had refilled his pipe and resumed his seat, taking no notice of my comment.\a147The practical application of what I have said is very close to the problem which I am investigating. It is a tangled skein, you understand, and I am looking for a loose end. One possible loose end lies in the question: Why does Professor Presbury\a146s wolfhound, Roy, endeavour to bite him?\a148I sank back in my chair in some disappointment. Was it for so trivial a question as this that I had been summoned from my work? Holmes glanced across at me.\a147The same old Watson!\a148 said he. \a147You never learn that the gravest issues may depend upon the smallest things. But is it not on the face of it strange that a staid, elderly philosopher\a151 you\a146ve heard of Presbury, of course, the famous Camford physiologist?that such a man, whose friend has been his devoted wolfhound, should now have been twice attacked by his own dog? What do you make of it?\a148\a147The dog is ill.\a148\a147Well, that has to be considered. But he attacks no one else, nor does he apparently molest his master, save on very special occasions. Curious, Watson\a151 very curious. But young Mr. Bennett is before his time if that is his ring. I had hoped to have a longer chat with you before he came.\a148There was a quick step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door and a moment later the new client presented himself. He was a tall, handsome youth about thirty, well dressed and elegant, but with something in his bearing which suggested the shyness of the student rather than the self-possession of the man of the world. He shook hands with Holmes, and then looked with some surprise at me.\a147This matter is very delicate, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147 Consider the relation in which I stand to Professor Presbury both privately and publicly. I really can hardly justify myself if I speak before any third person.\a148\a147Have no fear, Mr. Bennett. Dr. Watson is the very soul of discretion, and I can assure you that this is a matter in which I am very likely to need an assistant.\a148\a147As you like, Mr. Holmes. You will, I am sure, understand my having some reserves in the matter.\a148\a147You will appreciate it, Watson, when I tell you that this gentleman, Mr. Trevor Bennett, is professional assistant to the great scientist, lives under his roof, and is engaged to his only daughter. Certainly we must agree that the professor has every claim upon his loyalty and devotion. But it may best be shown by taking the necessary steps to clear up this strange mystery.\a148\a147I hope so, Mr. Holmes. That is my one object. Does Dr. Watson know the situation?\a148\a147I have not had time to explain it.\a148\a147Then perhaps I had better go over the ground again before explaining some fresh developments.\a148\a147I will do so myself,\a148 said Holmes, \a147in order to show that I have the events in their due order. The professor, Watson, is a man of European reputation. His life has been academic. There has never been a breath of scandal. He is a widower with one daughter, Edith. He is, I gather, a man of very virile and positive, one might almost say combative, character. So the matter stood until a very few months ago.\a147Then the current of his life was broken. He is sixty-one years of age, but he became engaged to the daughter of Professor Morphy, his colleague in the chair of comparative anatomy. It was not, as I understand, the reasoned courting of an elderly man but rather the passionate frenzy of youth, for no one could have shown himself a more devoted lover. The lady, Alice Morphy, was a very perfect girl both in mind and body, so that there was every excuse for the professor\a146s infatuation. None the less, it did not meet with full approval in his own family.\a148\a147We thought it rather excessive,\a148 said our visitor.\a147Exactly. Excessive and a little violent and unnatural. Professor Presbury was rich, however, and there was no objection upon the part of the father. The daughter, however, had other views, and there were already several candidates for her hand, who, if they were less eligible from a worldly point of view, were at least more of an age. The girl seemed to like the professor in spite of his eccentricities. It was only age which stood in the way.\a147About this time a little mystery suddenly clouded the normal routine of the professor\a146s life. He did what he had never done before. He left home and gave no indication where he was going. He was away a fortnight and returned looking rather travel-worn. He made no allusion to where he had been, although he was usually the frankest of men. It chanced, however, that our client here, Mr. Bennett, received a letter from a fellow-student in Prague, who said that he was glad to have seen Professor Presbury there, although he had not been able to talk to him. Only in this way did his own household learn where he had been.\a147Now comes the point. From that time onward a curious change came over the professor. He became furtive and sly. Those around him had always the feeling that he was not the man that they had known, but that he was under some shadow which had darkened his higher qualities. His intellect was not affected. His lectures were as brilliant as ever. But always there was something new, something sinister and unexpected. His daughter, who was devoted to him, tried again and again to resume the old relations and to penetrate this mask which her father seemed to have put on. You, sir, as I understand, did the same\a151 but all was in vain. And now, Mr. Bennett, tell in your own words the incident of the letters.\a148\a147You must understand, Dr. Watson, that the professor had no secrets from me. If I were his son or his younger brother I could not have more completely enjoyed his confidence. As his secretary I handled every paper which came to him, and I opened and subdivided his letters. Shortly after his return all this was changed. He told me that certain letters might come to him from London which would be marked by a cross under the stamp. These were to be set aside for his own eyes only. I may say that several of these did pass through my hands, that they had the E. C. mark, and were in an illiterate handwriting. If he answered them at all the answers did not pass through my hands nor into the letter-basket in which our correspondence was collected.\a148\a147And the box,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Ah, yes, the box. The professor brought back a little wooden box from his travels. It was the one thing which suggested a Continental tour, for it was one of those quaint carved things which one associates with Germany. This he placed in his instrument cupboard. One day, in looking for a canula, I took up the box. To my surprise he was very angry, and reproved me in words which were quite savage for my curiosity. It was the first time such a thing had happened, and I was deeply hurt. I endeavoured to explain that it was a mere accident that I had touched the box, but all the evening I was conscious that he looked at me harshly and that the incident was rankling in his mind.\a148 Mr. Bennett drew a little diary book from his pocket. \a147That was on July 2d,\a148 said he.\a147You are certainly an admirable witness,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I may need some of these dates which you have noted.\a148\a147I learned method among other things from my great teacher. From the time that I observed abnormality in his behaviour I felt that it was my duty to study his case. Thus I have it here that it was on that very day, July 2d, that Roy attacked the professor as he came from his study into the hall. Again, on July 11th, there was a scene of the same sort, and then I have a note of yet another upon July 20th. After that we had to banish Roy to the stables. He was a dear, affectionate animal\a151 but I fear I weary you.\a148Mr. Bennett spoke in a tone of reproach, for it was very clear that Holmes was not listening. His face was rigid and his eyes gazed abstractedly at the ceiling. With an effort he recovered himself.\a147Singular! Most singular!\a148 he murmured. \a147These details were new to me, Mr. Bennett. I think we have now fairly gone over the old ground, have we not? But you spoke of some fresh developments.\a148The pleasant, open face of our visitor clouded over, shadowed by some grim remembrance. \a147What I speak of occurred the night before last,\a148 said he. \a147I was lying awake about two in the morning, when I was aware of a dull muffled sound coming from the passage. I opened my door and peeped out. I should explain that the professor sleeps at the end of the passage\a151\a148\a147The date being?\a148 asked Holmes.Our visitor was clearly annoyed at so irrelevant an interruption.\a147I have said, sir, that it was the night before last\a151 that is, September 4th.\a148Holmes nodded and smiled.\a147Pray continue,\a148 said he.\a147He sleeps at the end of the passage and would have to pass my door in order to reach the staircase. It was a really terrifying experience, Mr. Holmes. I think that I am as strong-nerved as my neighbours, but I was shaken by what I saw. The passage was dark save that one window halfway along it threw a patch of light. I could see that something was coming along the passage, something dark and crouching. Then suddenly it emerged into the light, and I saw that it was he. He was crawling, Mr. Holmes\a151 crawling! He was not quite on his hands and knees. I should rather say on his hands and feet, with his face sunk between his hands. Yet he seemed to move with ease. I was so paralysed by the sight that it was not until he had reached my door that I was able to step forward and ask if I could assist him. His answer was extraordinary. He sprang up, spat out some atrocious word at me, and hurried on past me, and down the staircase. I waited about for an hour, but he did not come back. It must have been daylight before he regained his room.\a148\a147Well, Watson, what make you of that?\a148 asked Holmes with the air of the pathologist who presents a rare specimen.\a147Lumbago, possibly. I have known a severe attack make a man walk in just such a way, and nothing would be more trying to the temper.\a148\a147Good, Watson! You always keep us flat-footed on the ground. But we can hardly accept lumbago, since he was able to stand erect in a moment.\a148\a147He was never better in health,\a148 said Bennett. \a147In fact, he is stronger than I have known him for years. But there are the facts, Mr. Holmes. It is not a case in which we can consult the police, and yet we are utterly at our wit\a146s end as to what to do, and we feel in some strange way that we are drifting towards disaster. Edith\a151 Miss Presbury\a151 feels as I do, that we cannot wait passively any longer.\a148\a147It is certainly a very curious and suggestive case. What do you think, Watson?\a148\a147Speaking as a medical man,\a148 said I, \a147it appears to be a case for an alienist. The old gentleman\a146s cerebral processes were disturbed by the love affair. He made a journey abroad in the hope of breaking himself of the passion. His letters and the box may be connected with some other private transaction\a151 a loan, perhaps, or share certificates, which are in the box.\a148\a147And the wolfhound no doubt disapproved of the financial bargain. No, no, Watson, there is more in it than this. Now, I can only suggest\a151\a148What Sherlock Holmes was about to suggest will never be known, for at this moment the door opened and a young lady was shown into the room. As she appeared Mr. Bennett sprang up with a cry and ran forward with his hands out to meet those which she had herself outstretched.\a147Edith, dear! Nothing the matter, I hope?\a148\a147I felt I must follow you. Oh, Jack, I have been so dreadfully frightened! It is awful to be there alone.\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, this is the young lady I spoke of. This is my fianc\a233.\a148\a147We were gradually coming to that conclusion, were we not, Watson?\a148 Holmes answered with a smile. \a147I take it, Miss Presbury, that there is some fresh development in the case, and that you thought we should know?\a148Our new visitor, a bright, handsome girl of a conventional English type, smiled back at Holmes as she seated herself beside Mr. Bennett.\a147When I found Mr. Bennett had left his hotel I thought I should probably find him here. Of course, he had told me that he would consult you. But, oh, Mr. Holmes, can you do nothing for my poor father?\a148\a147I have hopes, Miss Presbury, but the case is still obscure. Perhaps what you have to say may throw some fresh light upon it.\a148\a147It was last night, Mr. Holmes. He had been very strange all day. I am sure that there are times when he has no recollection of what he does. He lives as in a strange dream. Yesterday was such a day. It was not my father with whom I lived. His outward shell was there, but it was not really he.\a148\a147Tell me what happened.\a148\a147I was awakened in the night by the dog barking most furiously. Poor Roy, he is chained now near the stable. I may say that I always sleep with my door locked; for, as Jack\a151 as Mr. Bennett\a151 will tell you, we all have a feeling of impending danger. My room is on the second floor. It happened that the blind was up in my window, and there was bright moonlight outside. As I lay with my eyes fixed upon the square of light, listening to the frenzied barkings of the dog, I was amazed to see my father\a146s face looking in at me. Mr. Holmes, I nearly died of surprise and horror. There it was pressed against the windowpane, and one hand seemed to be raised as if to push up the window. If that window had opened, I think I should have gone mad. It was no delusion, Mr. Holmes. Don\a146t deceive yourself by thinking so. I dare say it was twenty seconds or so that I lay paralysed and watched the face. Then it vanished, but I could not\a151 I could not spring out of bed and look out after it. I lay cold and shivering till morning. At breakfast he was sharp and fierce in manner, and made no allusion to the adventure of the night. Neither did I, but I gave an excuse for coming to town\a151 and here I am.\a148Holmes looked thoroughly surprised at Miss Presbury\a146s narrative.\a147My dear young lady, you say that your room is on the second floor. Is there a long ladder in the garden?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, that is the amazing part of it. There is no possible way of reaching the window\a151 and yet he was there.\a148\a147The date being September 5th,\a148 said Holmes. \a147That certainly complicates matters.\a148It was the young lady\a146s turn to look surprised. \a147This is the second time that you have alluded to the date, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Bennett. \a147Is it possible that it has any bearing upon the case?\a148\a147It is possible\a151 very possible\a151 and yet I have not my full material at present.\a148\a147Possibly you are thinking of the connection between insanity and phases of the moon?\a148\a147No, I assure you. It was quite a different line of thought. Possibly you can leave your notebook with me, and I will check the dates. Now I think, Watson, that our line of action is perfectly clear. This young lady has informed us\a151 and I have the greatest confidence in her intuition\a151 that her father remembers little or nothing which occurs upon certain dates. We will therefore call upon him as if he had given us an appointment upon such a date. He will put it down to his own lack of memory. Thus we will open our campaign by having a good close view of him.\a148\a147That is excellent,\a148 said Mr. Bennett. \a147I warn you, however, that the professor is irascible and violent at times.\a148Holmes smiled. \a147There are reasons why we should come at once\a151 very cogent reasons if my theories hold good. To-morrow, Mr. Bennett, will certainly see us in Camford. There is, if I remember right, an inn called the Chequers where the port used to be above mediocrity and the linen was above reproach. I think, Watson, that our lot for the next few days might lie in less pleasant places.\a148Monday morning found us on our way to the famous university town\a151 an easy effort on the part of Holmes, who had no roots to pull up, but one which involved frantic planning and hurrying on my part, as my practice was by this time not inconsiderable. Holmes made no allusion to the case until after we had deposited our suitcases at the ancient hostel of which he had spoken.\a147I think, Watson, that we can catch the professor just before lunch. He lectures at eleven and should have an interval at home.\a148\a147What possible excuse have we for calling?\a148Holmes glanced at his notebook.\a147There was a period of excitement upon August 26th. We will assume that he is a little hazy as to what he does at such times. If we insist that we are there by appointment I think he will hardly venture to contradict us. Have you the effrontery necessary to put it through?\a148\a147We can but try.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! Compound of the Busy Bee and Excelsior. We can but try\a151 the motto of the firm. A friendly native will surely guide us.\a148Such a one on the back of a smart hansom swept us past a row of ancient colleges and, finally turning into a tree-lined drive, pulled up at the door of a charming house, girt round with lawns and covered with purple wistaria. Professor Presbury was certainly surrounded with every sign not only of comfort but of luxury. Even as we pulled up, a grizzled head appeared at the front window, and we were aware of a pair of keen eyes from under shaggy brows which surveyed us through large horn glasses. A moment later we were actually in his sanctum, and the mysterious scientist, whose vagaries had brought us from London, was standing before us. There was certainly no sign of eccentricity either in his manner or appearance, for he was a portly, large-featured man, grave, tall, and frock-coated, with the dignity of bearing which a lecturer needs. His eyes were his most remarkable feature, keen, observant, and clever to the verge of cunning.He looked at our cards. \a147Pray sit down, gentlemen. What can I do for you?\a148Mr. Holmes smiled amiably.\a147It was the question which I was about to put to you, Professor.\a148\a147To me, sir!\a148\a147Possibly there is some mistake. I heard through a second person that Professor Presbury of Camford had need of my services.\a148\a147Oh, indeed!\a148 It seemed to me that there was a malicious sparkle in the intense grey eyes. \a147You heard that, did you? May I ask the name of your informant?\a148\a147I am sorry, Professor, but the matter was rather confidential. If I have made a mistake there is no harm done. I can only express my regret.\a148\a147Not at all. I should wish to go further into this matter. It interests me. Have you any scrap of writing, any letter or telegram, to bear out your assertion?\a148\a147No, I have not.\a148\a147I presume that you do not go so far as to assert that I summoned you?\a148\a147I would rather answer no questions,\a148 said Holmes.\a147No, I dare say not,\a148 said the professor with asperity. \a147 However, that particular one can be answered very easily without your aid.\a148He walked across the room to the bell. Our London friend Mr. Bennett, answered the call.\a147Come in, Mr. Bennett. These two gentlemen have come from London under the impression that they have been summoned. You handle all my correspondence. Have you a note of anything going to a person named Holmes?\a148\a147No, sir,\a148 Bennett answered with a flush.\a147That is conclusive,\a148 said the professor, glaring angrily at my companion. \a147Now, sir\a148he leaned forward with his two hands upon the table\a151\a148 it seems to me that your position is a very questionable one.\a148Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147I can only repeat that I am sorry that we have made a needless intrusion.\a148\a147Hardly enough, Mr. Holmes!\a148 the old man cried in a high screaming voice, with extraordinary malignancy upon his face. He got between us and the door as he spoke, and he shook his two hands at us with furious passion. \a147You can hardly get out of it so easily as that.\a148 His face was convulsed, and he grinned and gibbered at us in his senseless rage. I am convinced that we should have had to fight our way out of the room if Mr. Bennett had not intervened.\a147My dear Professor,\a148 he cried, \a147consider your position! Consider the scandal at the university! Mr. Holmes is a well-known man. You cannot possibly treat him with such discourtesy.\a148Sulkily our host\a151 if I may call him so\a151 cleared the path to the door. We were glad to find ourselves outside the house and in the quiet of the tree-lined drive. Holmes seemed greatly amused by the episode.\a147Our learned friend\a146s nerves are somewhat out of order,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps our intrusion was a little crude, and yet we have gained that personal contact which I desired. But, dear me, Watson, he is surely at our heels. The villain still pursues us.\a148There were the sounds of running feet behind, but it was, to my relief, not the formidable professor but his assistant who appeared round the curve of the drive. He came panting up to us.\a147I am so sorry, Mr. Holmes. I wished to apologise.\a148\a147My dear sir, there is no need. It is all in the way of professional experience.\a148\a147I have never seen him in a more dangerous mood. But he grows more sinister. You can understand now why his daughter and I are alarmed. And yet his mind is perfectly clear.\a148\a147Too clear!\a148 said Holmes. \a147That was my miscalculation. It is evident that his memory is much more reliable than I had thought. By the way, can we, before we go, see the window of Miss Presbury\a146s room?\a148Mr. Bennett pushed his way through some shrubs, and we had a view of the side of the house.\a147It is there. The second on the left.\a148\a147Dear me, it seems hardly accessible. And yet you will observe that there is a creeper below and a water-pipe above which give some foothold.\a148\a147I could not climb it myself,\a148 said Mr. Bennett.\a147Very likely. It would certainly be a dangerous exploit for any normal man.\a148\a147There was one other thing I wish to tell you, Mr. Holmes. I have the address of the man in London to whom the professor writes. He seems to have written this morning, and I got it from his blotting-paper. It is an ignoble position for a trusted secretary, but what else can I do?\a148Holmes glanced at the paper and put it into his pocket.\a147Dorak\a151 a curious name. Slavonic, I imagine. Well, it is an important link in the chain. We return to London this afternoon, Mr. Bennett. I see no good purpose to be served by our remaining. We cannot arrest the professor because he has done no crime, nor can we place him under constraint, for he cannot be proved to be mad. No action is as yet possible.\a148\a147Then what on earth are we to do?\a148\a147A little patience, Mr. Bennett. Things will soon develop. Unless I am mistaken, next Tuesday may mark a crisis. Certainly we shall be in Camford on that day. Meanwhile, the general position is undeniably unpleasant, and if Miss Presbury can prolong her visit \a148\a147That is easy.\a148\a147Then let her stay till we can assure her that all danger is past. Meanwhile, let him have his way and do not cross him. So long as he is in a good humour all is well.\a148\a147There he is!\a148 said Bennett in a startled whisper. Looking between the branches we saw the tall, erect figure emerge from the hall door and look around him. He stood leaning forward, his hands swinging straight before him, his head turning from side to side. The secretary with a last wave slipped off among the trees, and we saw him presently rejoin his employer, the two entering the house together in what seemed to be animated and even excited conversation.\a147I expect the old gentleman has been putting two and two together,\a148 said Holmes as we walked hotel-ward. \a147He struck me as having a particularly clear and logical brain from the little I saw of him. Explosive, no doubt, but then from his point of view he has something to explode about if detectives are put on his track and he suspects his own household of doing it. I rather fancy that friend Bennett is in for an uncomfortable time.\a148H\tolmes stopped at a post-office and sent off a telegram on our way. The answer reached us in the evening, and he tossed it across to me.\tH\tave visited the Commercial Road and seen Dorak. Suave person, Bohemian, elderly. Keeps large general store.\tM\tERCER.\t\a147Mercer is since your time,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He is my general utility man who looks up routine business. It was important to know something of the man with whom our professor was so secretly corresponding. His nationality connects up with the Prague visit.\a148\a147Thank goodness that something connects with something,\a148 said I. \a147At present we seem to be faced by a long series of inexplicable incidents with no bearing upon each other.\a147For example, what possible connection can there be between an angry wolfhound and a visit to Bohemia, or either of them with a man crawling down a passage at night? As to your dates, that is the biggest mystification of all.\a148Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. We were, I may say, seated in the old sitting-room of the ancient hotel, with a bottle of the famous vintage of which Holmes had spoken on the table between us.\a147Well, now, let us take the dates first,\a148 said he, his fingertips together and his manner as if he were addressing a class. \a147This excellent young man\a146s diary shows that there was trouble upon July 2d, and from then onward it seems to have been at nine-day intervals, with, so far as I remember, only one exception. Thus the last outbreak upon Friday was on September 3d, which also falls into the series, as did August 26th, which preceded it. The thing is beyond coincidence.\a148I was forced to agree.\a147Let us, then, form the provisional theory that every nine days the professor takes some strong drug which has a passing but highly poisonous effect. His naturally violent nature is intensified by it. He learned to take this drug while he was in Prague, and is now supplied with it by a Bohemian intermediary in London. This all hangs together, Watson!\a148\a147But the dog, the face at the window, the creeping man in the passage?\a148\a147Well, well, we have made a beginning. I should not expect any fresh developments until next Tuesday. In the meantime we can only keep in touch with friend Bennett and enjoy the amenities of this charming town.\a148In the morning Mr. Bennett slipped round to bring us the latest report. As Holmes had imagined, times had not been easy with him. Without exactly accusing him of being responsible for our presence, the professor had been very rough and rude in his speech, and evidently felt some strong grievance. This morning he was quite himself again, however, and had delivered his usual brilliant lecture to a crowded class. \a147Apart from his queer fits,\a148 said Bennett, \a147he has actually more energy and vitality than I can ever remember, nor was his brain ever clearer. But it\a146s not he\a151 it\a146s never the man whom we have known.\a148\a147I don\a146t think you have anything to fear now for a week at least,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147I am a busy man, and Dr. Watson has his patients to attend to. Let us agree that we meet here at this hour next Tuesday, and I shall be surprised if before we leave you again we are not able to explain, even if we cannot perhaps put an end to, your troubles. Meanwhile, keep us posted in what occurs.\a148I saw nothing of my friend for the next few days, but on the following Monday evening I had a short note asking me to meet him next day at the train. From what he told me as we travelled up to Camford all was well, the peace of the professor\a146s house had been unruffled, and his own conduct perfectly normal. This also was the report which was given us by Mr. Bennett himself when he called upon us that evening at our old quarters in the Chequers. \a147He heard from his London correspondent to-day. There was a letter and there was a small packet, each with the cross under the stamp which warned me not to touch them. There has been nothing else.\a148\a147That may prove quite enough,\a148 said Holmes grimly. \a147Now, Mr. Bennett, we shall, I think, come to some conclusion tonight. If my deductions are correct we should have an opportunity of bringing matters to a head. In order to do so it is necessary to hold the professor under observation. I would suggest, therefore, that you remain awake and on the lookout. Should you hear him pass your door, do not interrupt him, but follow him as discreetly as you can. Dr. Watson and I will not be far off. By the way, where is the key of that little box of which you spoke?\a148\a147Upon his watch-chain.\a148\a147I fancy our researches must lie in that direction. At the worst the lock should not be very formidable. Have you any other able-bodied man on the premises?\a148\a147There is the coachman, Macphail.\a148\a147Where does he sleep?\a148\a147Over the stables.\a148\a147We might possibly want him. Well, we can do no more until we see how things develop, Good-bye\a151 but I expect that we shall see you before morning.\a148It was nearly midnight before we took our station among some bushes immediately opposite the hall door of the professor. It was a fine night, but chilly, and we were glad of our warm overcoats. There was a breeze, and clouds were scudding across the sky, obscuring from time to time the half-moon. It would have been a dismal vigil were it not for the expectation and excitement which carried us along, and the assurance of my comrade that we had probably reached the end of the strange sequence of events which had engaged our attention.\a147If the cycle of nine days holds good then we shall have the professor at his worst to-night,\a148 said Holmes. \a147The fact that these strange symptoms began after his visit to Prague, that he is in secret correspondence with a Bohemian dealer in London, who presumably represents someone in Prague, and that he received a packet from him this very day, all point in one direction. What he takes and why he takes it are still beyond our ken, but that it emanates in some way from Prague is clear enough. He takes it under definite directions which regulate this ninth-day system, which was the first point which attracted my attention. But his symptoms are most remarkable. Did you observe his knuckles?\a148I had to confess that I did not.\a147Thick and horny in a way which is quite new in my experience. Always look at the hands first, Watson. Then cuffs, trouser-knees, and boots. Very curious knuckles which can only be explained by the mode of progression observed by\a151\a148 Holmes paused and suddenly clapped his hand to his forehead. \a147Oh, Watson, Watson, what a fool I have been! It seems incredible, and yet it must be true. All points in one direction. How could I miss seeing the connection of ideas? Those knuckles how could I have passed those knuckles? And the dog! And the ivy! It\a146s surely time that I disappeared into that little farm of my dreams. Look out, Watson! Here he is! We shall have the chance of seeing for ourselves.\a148The hall door had slowly opened, and against the lamp-lit background we saw the tall figure of Professor Presbury. He was clad in his dressing gown. As he stood outlined in the doorway he was erect but leaning forward with dangling arms, as when we saw him last.Now he stepped forward into the drive, and an extraordinary change came over him. He sank down into a crouching position and moved along upon his hands and feet, skipping every now and then as if he were overflowing with energy and vitality. He moved along the face of the house and then round the corner. As he disappeared Bennett slipped through the hall door and softly followed him.\a147Come, Watson, come!\a148 cried Holmes, and we stole as softly as we could through the bushes until we had gained a spot whence we could see the other side of the house, which was bathed in the light of the half-moon. The professor was clearly visible crouching at the foot of the ivy-covered wall. As we watched him he suddenly began with incredible agility to ascend it. From branch to branch he sprang, sure of foot and firm of grasp, climbing apparently in mere joy at his own powers, with no definite object in view. With his dressing-gown flapping on each side of him, he looked like some huge bat glued against the side of his own house, a great square dark patch upon the moonlit wall. Presently he tired of this amusement, and, dropping from branch to branch, he squatted down into the old attitude and moved towards the stables, creeping along in the same strange way as before. The wolfhound was out now, barking furiously, and more excited than ever when it actually caught sight of its master. It was straining on its chain and quivering with eagerness and rage. The professor squatted down very deliberately just out of reach of the hound and began to provoke it in every possible way. He took handfuls of pebbles from the drive and threw them in the dog\a146s face, prodded him with a stick which he had picked up, flicked his hands about only a few inches from the gaping mouth, and endeavoured in every way to increase the animal\a146s fury, which was already beyond all control. In all our adventures I do not know that I have ever seen a more strange sight than this impassive and still dignified figure crouching frog-like upon the ground and goading to a wilder exhibition of passion the maddened hound, which ramped and raged in front of him, by all manner of ingenious and calculated cruelty.And then in a moment it happened! It was not the chain that broke, but it was the collar that slipped, for it had been made for a thick-necked Newfoundland. We heard the rattle of falling metal, and the next instant dog and man were rolling on the ground together, the one roaring in rage, the other screaming in a strange shrill falsetto of terror. It was a very narrow thing for the professor\a146s life. The savage creature had him fairly by the throat, its fangs had bitten deep, and he was senseless before we could reach them and drag the two apart. It might have been a dangerous task for us, but Bennett\a146s voice and presence brought the great wolf-hound instantly to reason. The uproar had brought the sleepy and astonished coachman from his room above the stables. \a147I\a146m not surprised,\a148 said he, shaking his head. \a147I\a146ve seen him at it before. I knew the dog would get him sooner or later.\a148The hound was secured, and together we carried the professor up to his room, where Bennett, who had a medical degree, helped me to dress his torn throat. The sharp teeth had passed dangerously near the carotid artery, and the haemorrhage was serious. In half an hour the danger was past, I had given the patient an injection of morphia, and he had sunk into deep sleep. Then, and only then, were we able to look at each other and to take stock of the situation.\a147I think a first-class surgeon should see him,\a148 said I.\a147For God\a146s sake, no!\a148 cried Bennett. \a147At present the scandal is confined to our own household. It is safe with us. If it gets beyond these walls it will never stop. Consider his position at the university, his European reputation, the feelings of his daughter.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think it may be quite possible to keep the matter to ourselves, and also to prevent its recurrence now that we have a free hand. The key from the watch-chain, Mr. Bennett. Macphail will guard the patient and let us know if there is any change. Let us see what we can find in the professor\a146s mysterious box.\a148There was not much, but there was enough\a151 an empty phial, another nearly full, a hypodermic syringe, several letters in a crabbed, foreign hand. The marks on the envelopes showed that they were those which had disturbed the routine of the secretary, and each was dated from the Commercial Road and signed \a147A. Dorak.\a148 They were mere invoices to say that a fresh bottle was being sent to Professor Presbury, or receipt to acknowledge money. There was one other envelope, however, in a more educated hand and bearing the Austrian stamp with the postmark of Prague. \a147Here we have our material!\a148 cried Holmes as he tore out the enclosure.HONOURED COLLEAGUE [it ran]:Since your esteemed visit I have thought much of your case, and though in your circumstances there are some special reasons for the treatment, I would none the less enjoin caution, as my results have shown that it is not without danger of a kind.It is possible that the serum of anthropoid would have been better. I have, as I explained to you, used black-faced langur because a specimen was accessible. Langur is, of course, a crawler and climber, while anthropoid walks erect and is in all ways nearer.I beg you to take every possible precaution that there be no premature revelation of the process. I have one other client in England, and Dorak is my agent for both.Weekly reports will oblige.Yours with high esteem,H. LOWENSTEIN.Lowenstein! The name brought back to me the memory of some snippet from a newspaper which spoke of an obscure scientist who was striving in some unknown way for the secret of rejuvenescence and the elixir of life. Lowenstein of Prague! Lowenstein with the wondrous strength-giving serum, tabooed by the profession because he refused to reveal its source. In a few words I said what I remembered. Bennett had taken a manual of zoology from the shelves. \a147\a160\a145Langur.\a146 \a147 he read. \a147\a160\a145the great black-faced monkey of the Himalayan slopes, biggest and most human of climbing monkeys. Many details are added. Well, thanks to you, Mr. Holmes, it is very clear that we have traced the evil to its source.\a148\a147The real source,\a148 said Holmes, \a147lies, of course, in that untimely love affair which gave our impetuous professor the idea that he could only gain his wish by turning himself into a younger man. When one tries to rise above Nature one is liable to fall below it. The highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny.\a148 He sat musing for a little with the phial in his hand, looking at the clear liquid within. \a147When I have written to this man and told him that I hold him criminally responsible for the poisons which he circulates, we will have no more trouble. But it may recur. Others may find a better way. There is danger there\a151 a very real danger to humanity. Consider, Watson, that the material, the sensual, the worldly would all prolong their worthless lives. The spiritual would not avoid the call to something higher. It would be the survival of the least fit. What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?\a148 Suddenly the dreamer disappeared, and Holmes, the man of action, sprang from his chair. \a147I think there is nothing more to be said, Mr. Bennett. The various incidents will now fit themselves easily into the general scheme. The dog, of course, was aware of the change far more quickly than you. His smell would insure that. It was the monkey, not the professor, whom Roy attacked, just as it was the monkey who teased Roy. Climbing was a joy to the creature, and it was a mere chance, I take it, that the pastime brought him to the young lady\a146s window. There is an early train to town, Watson, but I think we shall just have time for a cup of tea at the Chequers before we catch it.\a148\p\X1\BThe Sussex Vampire\B\X1\c\i\m="suss-04.png"\i\cHolmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me.\a147For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,\a148 said he. \a147What do you make of it, Watson?\a148I read as follows:46, OLD JEWRY,Nov. 19th.Re VampiresSIR:Our client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr. Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.We are, sir,Faithfully yours,MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD.per E. J. C.\a147Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,\a148 said Holmes in a reminiscent voice. \a147It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimms\a146 fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.\a148I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime.\a147Voyage of the Gloria Scott,\a148 he read. \a147That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, the forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can\a146t beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania.\a148 He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment.\a147Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It\a146s pure lunacy.\a148\a147But surely,\a148 said I, \a147the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read, for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.\a148\a147You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr. Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.\a148He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table while he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.\a147Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson?\a148\a147It is in Sussex, South of Horsham.\a148\a147Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman\a146s?\a148\a147I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley\a146s and Harvey\a146s and Carriton\a146s\a151 the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.\a148\a147Precisely,\a148 said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh information very quietly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgment to the giver. \a147I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.\a148\a147With me!\a148\a147You had better read it.\a148H\te handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted.\tD\tEAR MR HOLMES [it said]:\tI\t have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have\a151 to all appearance absolutely devoted.\tN\tow for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.\tT\this was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.\tI\tt left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse\a146s mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child\a146s life and a man\a146s sanity may depend upon it.\tA\tt last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse\a146s nerve had given way; she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. While they were talking a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery.\tI\tmagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the child\a146s exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife\a146s face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she\a151 she beyond all question\a151 who had drunk the poor baby\a146s blood.\tS\to the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know, little of vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex\a151 well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman\a146s, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o\a146clock.\tY\tours faithfully,\tR\tOBERT FERGUSON.\tP\t. S. I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give. \t\a147Of course I remembered him,\a148 said I as I laid down the letter. \a147Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It\a146s like him to be so concerned over a friend\a146s case.\a148Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.\a147I never get your limits, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. \a145Will examine your case with pleasure.\a146\a160\a148\a147Your case!\a148\a147We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.\a148Promptly at ten o\a146clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.\a147Hullo, Watson,\a148 said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. \a147You don\a146t look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it\a146s this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr. Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone\a146s deputy.\a148 .\a147It is simpler to deal direct,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman whom you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr. Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God\a146s sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wit\a146s end.\a148\a147Very naturally, Mr. Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wit\a146s end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?\a148\a147We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr. Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name\a151 a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.\a148\a147Then the child is in no immediate danger?\a148\a147Mrs. Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.\a148\a147But never wounded?\a148\a147No, she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.\a148 Ferguson\a146s gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. \a147You would think that the dear lad\a146s condition would soften anyone\a146s heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr. Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within.\a148Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. \a147What other inmates are there in your house, Mr. Ferguson?\a148\a147Two servants who have not been long with us. One stablehand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs. Mason. That is all.\a148\a147I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?\a148\a147I had only known her a few weeks.\a148\a147How long had this maid Dolores been with her?\a148\a147Some years.\a148\a147Then your wife\a146s character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?\a148\a147Yes, you may say so.\a148Holmes made a note.\a147I fancy,\a148 said he, \a147that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.\a148Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.\a147It is what I hoped, Mr. Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria if you could come.\a148\a147Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady, as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?\a148\a147That is so.\a148\a147But the assaults take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son.\a148\a147Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.\a148\a147Did she give no explanation why she struck him?\a148\a147None save that she hated him. Again and again she said so.\a148\a147Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature?\a148\a147Yes, she is very jealous\a151 jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.\a148\a147But the boy\a151 he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?\a148\a147No, he declared there was no reason.\a148\a147Were they good friends at other times?\a148\a147No, there was never any love between them.\a148\a147Yet you say he is affectionate?\a148\a147Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do.\a148Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought.\a147No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?\a148\a147Very much so.\a148\a147And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?\a148\a147Most devoted.\a148\a147He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?\a148\a147In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs. Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.\a148\a147That certainly complicates matters.\a148\a147I don\a146t quite follow you, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o\a146clock.\a148It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the Chequers, Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.There was one very large central room into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought.\a147Hullo!\a148 he cried. \a147Hullo!\a148A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson\a146s hand.\a147What is it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147The dog. What\a146s the matter with it?\a148\a147That\a146s what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He\a146ll be all right soon\a151 won\a146t you, Carlo?\a148A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog\a146s mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case.\a147Did it come on suddenly?\a148\a147In a single night.\a148\a147How long ago?\a148\a147It may have been four months ago.\a148\a147Very remarkable. Very suggestive.\a148\a147What do you see in it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147A confirmation of what I had already thought.\a148\a147For God\a146s sake, what do you think, Mr. Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer\a151 my child in constant danger! Don\a146t play with me, Mr. Holmes. It is too terribly serious.\a148The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm.\a147I fear that there is pain for you, Mr. Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,\a148 said he. \a147I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.\a148\a147Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife\a146s room and see if there has been any change.\a148He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.\a147The tea is ready, Dolores,\a148 said Ferguson. \a147See that your mistress has everything she can wish.\a148\a147She verra ill,\a148 cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. \a147She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.\a148Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.\a147I should be so glad if I could be of use.\a148\a147Would your mistress see Dr. Watson?\a148\a147I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.\a148\a147Then I\a146ll come with you at once.\a148I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure.\a147She lie like that one day, two day. I \a146fraid she die,\a148 said the girl.The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.\a147Where is my husband?\a148\a147He is below and would wish to see you.\a148\a147I will not see him. I will not see him.\a148 Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. \a147A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?\a148\a147Can I help you in any way?\a148\a147No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.\a148The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil.\a147Madame,\a148 I said, \a147your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.\a148Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.\a147He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart? That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me\a151 he could speak of me so.\a148\a147He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.\a148\a147No, he cannot understand. But he should trust.\a148\a147Will you not see him?\a148 I suggested.\a147No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him.\a148 She turned her face to the wall and would say no more.I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.\a147How can I send her the child?\a148 he said. \a147How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood upon her lips?\a148 He shuddered at the recollection. \a147The child is safe with Mrs. Mason, and there he must remain.\a148A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.\a147Oh, daddy,\a148 he cried, \a147I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!\a148Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment.\a147Dear old chap,\a148 said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. \a147I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.\a148\a147Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?\a148\a147Yes.\a148The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.\a147What about your other child, Mr. Ferguson?\a148 asked Holmes. \a147Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?\a148\a147Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down,\a148 said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, dark-eyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly.\a147Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,\a148 he muttered as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention. Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.\a147Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.\a148He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: \a147Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.\a148 The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.\a147What is Mrs. Mason like?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.\a148\a147Do you like her, Jack?\a148 Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.\a147Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,\a148 said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. \a147Luckily I am one of his likes.\a148The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father\a146s breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him.\a147Run away, little Jacky,\a148 said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. \a147Now, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he continued when the boy was gone, \a147I really feel that I have brought you on a fool\a146s errand, for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.\a148\a147It is certainly delicate,\a148 said my friend with an amused smile, \a147but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.\a148Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.\a147For heaven\a146s sake, Holmes,\a148 he said hoarsely; \a147if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.\a148\a147Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?\a148\a147She is ill, but she is quite rational.\a148\a147Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.\a148\a147She will not see me,\a148 cried Ferguson.\a147Oh, yes, she will,\a148 said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper.\a147You at least have the entree, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?\a148I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out.\a147She will see them. She will leesten,\a148 said she.At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an armchair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.\a147I think we can dispense with Dolores,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr. Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.\a148Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.\a147Prove that, Mr. Holmes, and I am your debtor forever.\a148\a147I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.\a148\a147I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.\a148\a147Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child\a146s cot with the blood upon her lips.\a148\a147I did.\a148\a147Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?\a148\a147Poison!\a148\a147A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small birdbow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out.\a147And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understand him and he fitted into my reconstruction.\a147Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child\a146s life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.\a148\a147Jacky!\a148\a147I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.\a148\a147My Jacky!\a148\a147You have to face it, Mr. Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.\a148\a147Good God! It is incredible!\a148\a147Have I spoken the truth, madame?\a148The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband.\a147How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.\a148\a147I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,\a148 said Holmes, rising from his chair. \a147Only one thing is still clouded, madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There is a limit to a mother\a146s patience. But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?\a148\a147I had told Mrs. Mason. She knew.\a148\a147Exactly. So I imagined.\a148Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering.\a147This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,\a148 said Holmes in a whisper. \a147If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now,\a148 he added as he closed the door behind him, \a147I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.\a148I have only one further note of this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus:BAKER STREET,Nov. 21st.Re VampiresSIR:Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr. Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With thanks for your recommendation, I am, sir,Faithfully yours,SHERLOCK HOLMES.\p\X1\BThe Three Garridebs\B\X1\c\i\m="3gar-04.png"\i\cIt may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. It cost one man his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man the penalties of the law. Yet there was certainly an element of comedy. Well, you shall judge for yourselves.I remember the date very well, for it was in the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. I only refer to the matter in passing, for in my position of partner and confidant I am obliged to be particularly careful to avoid any indiscretion. I repeat, however, that this enables me to fix the date, which was the latter end of June, 1902, shortly after the conclusion of the South African War. Holmes had spent several days in bed, as was his habit from time to time, but he emerged that morning with a long foolscap document in his hand and a twinkle of amusement in his austere gray eyes.\a147There is a chance for you to make some money, friend Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Have you ever heard the name of Garrideb?\a148I admitted that I had not.\a147Well, if you can lay your hand upon a Garrideb, there\a146s money in it.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Ah, that\a146s a long story\a151 rather a whimsical one, too. I don\a146t think in all our explorations of human complexities we have ever come upon anything more singular. The fellow will be here presently for cross-examination, so I won\a146t open the matter up till he comes. But, meanwhile, that\a146s the name we want.\a148The telephone directory lay on the table beside me, and I turned over the pages in a rather hopeless quest. But to my amazement there was this strange name in its due place. I gave a cry of triumph.\a147Here you are, Holmes! Here it is!\a148Holmes took the book from my hand.\a147\a160\a145Garrideb, N.,\a146 \a147 he read, \a147\a160\a145136 Little Ryder Street, W.\a146 Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Watson, but this is the man himself. That is the address upon his letter. We want another to match him.\a148Mrs. Hudson had come in with a card upon a tray. I took it up and glanced at it.\a147Why, here it is!\a148 I cried in amazement. \a147This is a different initial. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, Moorville, Kansas, U. S. A. \a148Holmes smiled as he looked at the card. \a147I am afraid you must make yet another effort, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147This gentleman is also in the plot already, though I certainly did not expect to see him this morning. However, he is in a position to tell us a good deal which I want to know.\a148A moment later he was in the room. Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law, was a short, powerful man with the round, fresh, clean-shaven face characteristic of so many American men of affairs. The general effect was chubby and rather childlike, so that one received the impression of quite a young man with a broad set smile upon his face. His eyes, however, were arresting. Seldom in any human head have I seen a pair which bespoke a more intense inward life, so bright were they, so alert, so responsive to every change of thought. His accent was American, but was not accompanied by any eccentricity of speech.\a147Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked, glancing from one to the other. \a147Ah, yes! Your pictures are not unlike you, sir, if I may say so. I believe you have had a letter from my namesake, Mr. Nathan Garrideb, have you not?\a148\a147Pray sit down,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147We shall, I fancy, have a good deal to discuss.\a148 He took up his sheets of foolscap. \a147You are, of course, the Mr. John Garrideb mentioned in this document. But surely you have been in England some time?\a148\a147Why do you say that, Mr. Holmes?\a148 I seemed to read sudden suspicion in those expressive eyes.\a147Your whole outfit is English.\a148Mr. Garrideb forced a laugh. \a147I\a146ve read of your tricks, Mr. Holmes, but I never thought I would be the subject of them. Where do you read that?\a148\a147The shoulder cut of your coat, the toes of your boots\a151 could anyone doubt it?\a148\a147Well, well, I had no idea I was so obvious a Britisher. But business brought me over here some time ago, and so, as you say, my outfit is nearly all London. However, I guess your time is of value, and we did not meet to talk about the cut of my socks. What about getting down to that paper you hold in your hand?\a148Holmes had in some way ruffled our visitor, whose chubby face had assumed a far less amiable expression.\a147Patience! Patience, Mr. Garrideb!\a148 said my friend in a soothing voice. \a147Dr. Watson would tell you that these little digressions of mine sometimes prove in the end to have some bearing on the matter. But why did Mr. Nathan Garrideb not come with you?\a148\a147Why did he ever drag you into it at all?\a148 asked our visitor with a sudden outflame of anger. \a147What in thunder had you to do with it? Here was a bit of professional business between two gentlemen, and one of them must needs call in a detective! I saw him this morning, and he told me this fool-trick he had played me, and that\a146s why I am here. But I feel bad about it, all the same.\a148\a147There was no reflection upon you, Mr. Garrideb. It was simply zeal upon his part to gain your end\a151 an end which is, I understand, equally vital for both of you. He knew that I had means of getting information, and, therefore, it was very natural that he should apply to me.\a148Our visitor\a146s angry face gradually cleared.\a147Well, that puts it different,\a148 said he. \a147When I went to see him this morning and he told me he had sent to a detective, I just asked for your address and came right away. I don\a146t want police butting into a private matter. But if you are content just to help us find the man, there can be no harm in that.\a148\a147Well, that is just how it stands,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, sir, since you are here, we had best have a clear account from your own lips. My friend here knows nothing of the details.\a148Mr. Garrideb surveyed me with not too friendly a gaze.\a147Need he know?\a148 he asked.\a147We usually work together.\a148\a147Well, there\a146s no reason it should be kept a secret. I\a146ll give you the facts as short as I can make them. If you came from Kansas I would not need to explain to you who Alexander Hamilton Garrideb was. He made his money in real estate, and afterwards in the wheat pit at Chicago, but he spent it in buying up as much land as would make one of your counties, lying along the Arkansas River, west of Fort Dodge. It\a146s grazing-land and lumber-land and arable-land and mineralized-land, and just every sort of land that brings dollars to the man that owns it.\a147He had no kith nor kin\a151 or, if he had, I never heard of it. But he took a kind of pride in the queerness of his name. That was what brought us together. I was in the law at Topeka, and one day I had a visit from the old man, and he was tickled to death to meet another man with his own name. It was his pet fad, and he was dead set to find out if there were any more Garridebs in the world. \a145Find me another!\a146 said he. I told him I was a busy man and could not spend my life hiking round the world in search of Garridebs. \a145None the less,\a146 said he, \a145that is just what you will do if things pan out as I planned them.\a146 I thought he was joking, but there was a powerful lot of meaning in the words, as I was soon to discover.\a147For he died within a year of saying them, and he left a will behind him. It was the queerest will that has ever been filed in the State of Kansas. His property was divided into three parts and I was to have one on condition that I found two Garridebs who would share the remainder. It\a146s five million dollars for each if it is a cent, but we can\a146t lay a finger on it until we all three stand in a row.\a147It was so big a chance that I just let my legal practice slide and I set forth looking for Garridebs. There is not one in the United States. I went through it, sir, with a fine-toothed comb and never a Garrideb could I catch. Then I tried the old country. Sure enough there was the name in the London telephone directory. I went after him two days ago and explained the whole matter to him. But he is a lone man, like myself, with some women relations, but no men. It says three adult men in the will. So you see we still have a vacancy, and if you can help to fill it we will be very ready to pay your charges.\a148\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said Holmes with a smile, \a147I said it was rather whimsical, did I not? I should have thought, sir, that your obvious way was to advertise in the agony columns of the papers.\a148\a147I have done that, Mr. Holmes. No replies.\a148\a147Dear me! Well, it is certainly a most curious little problem. I may take a glance at it in my leisure. By the way, it is curious that you should have come from Topeka. I used to have a correspondent\a151 he is dead now\a151 old Dr. Lysander Starr, who was mayor in 1890.\a148\a147Good old Dr. Starr!\a148 said our visitor. \a147His name is still honoured. Well, Mr. Holmes, I suppose all we can do is to report to you and let you know how we progress. I reckon you will hear within a day or two.\a148 With this assurance our American bowed and departed.Holmes had lit his pipe, and he sat for some time with a curious smile upon his face.\a147Well?\a148 I asked at last.\a147I am wondering, Watson\a151 just wondering!\a148\a147At what?\a148Holmes took his pipe from his lips.\a147I was wondering, Watson, what on earth could be the object of this man in telling us such a rigmarole of lies. I nearly asked him so\a151 for there are times when a brutal frontal attack is the best policy\a151 but I judged it better to let him think he had fooled us. Here is a man with an English coat frayed at the elbow and trousers bagged at the knee with a year\a146s wear, and yet by this document and by his own account he is a provincial American lately landed in London. There have been no advertisements in the agony columns. You know that I miss nothing there. They are my favourite covert for putting up a bird, and I would never have overlooked such a cock pheasant as that. I never knew a Dr. Lysander Starr, of Topeka. Touch him where you would he was false. I think the fellow is really an American, but he has worn his accent smooth with years of London. What is his game, then, and what motive lies behind this preposterous search for Garridebs? It\a146s worth our attention, for, granting that the man is a rascal, he is certainly a complex and ingenious one. We must now find out if our other correspondent is a fraud also. Just ring him up, Watson.\a148I did so, and heard a thin, quavering voice at the other end of the line.\a147Yes, yes, I am Mr. Nathan Garrideb. Is Mr. Holmes there? I should very much like to have a word with Mr. Holmes.\a148My friend took the instrument and I heard the usual syncopated dialogue.\a147Yes, he has been here. I understand that you don\a146t know him\a148... How long? ... Only two days! ... Yes, yes, of course, it is a most captivating prospect. Will you be at home this evening? I suppose your namesake will not be there?\a160.\a160.\a160. Very good, we will come then, for I would rather have a chat without him\a148... Dr. Watson will come with me\a148... I understand from your note that you did not go out often\a148... Well, we shall be round about six. You need not mention it to the American lawyer\a148... Very good. Good-bye!\a148It was twilight of a lovely spring evening, and even Little Ryder Street, one of the smaller offshoots from the Edgware Road, within a stone-cast of old Tyburn Tree of evil memory, looked golden and wonderful in the slanting rays of the setting sun. The particular house to which we were directed was a large, old-fashioned, Early Georgian edifice, with a flat brick face broken only by two deep bay windows on the ground floor. It was on this ground floor that our client lived, and, indeed, the low windows proved to be the front of the huge room in which he spent his waking hours. Holmes pointed as we passed to the small brass plate which bore the curious name.\a147Up some years, Watson,\a148 he remarked, indicating its discoloured surface. \a147It\a146s his real name, anyhow, and that is something to note.\a148The house had a common stair, and there were a number of names painted in the hall, some indicating offices and some private chambers. It was not a collection of residential flats, but rather the abode of Bohemian bachelors. Our client opened the door for us himself and apologized by saying that the woman in charge left at four o\a146clock. Mr. Nathan Garrideb proved to be a very tall, loose-jointed, round-backed person, gaunt and bald, some sixty-odd years of age. He had a cadaverous face, with the dull dead skin of a man to whom exercise was unknown. Large round spectacles and a small projecting goat\a146s beard combined with his stooping attitude to give him an expression of peering curiosity. The general effect, however, was amiable, though eccentric.The room was as curious as its occupant. It looked like a small museum. It was both broad and deep, with cupboards and cabinets all round, crowded with specimens, geological and anatomical. Cases of butterflies and moths flanked each side of the entrance. A large table in the centre was littered with all sorts of debris, while the tall brass tube of a powerful microscope bristled up among them. As I glanced round I was surprised at the universality of the man\a146s interests. Here was a case of ancient coins. There was a cabinet of flint instruments. Behind his central table was a large cupboard of fossil bones. Above was a line of plaster skulls with such names as \a147Neanderthal,\a148 \a147 Heidelberg,\a148 \a147Cro-Magnon\a148 printed beneath them. It was clear that he was a student of many subjects. As he stood in front of us now, he held a piece of chamois leather in his right hand with which he was polishing a coin.\a147Syracusan\a151 of the best period,\a148 he explained, holding it up. \a147They degenerated greatly towards the end. At their best I hold them supreme, though some prefer the Alexandrian school. You will find a chair here, Mr. Holmes. Pray allow me to clear these bones. And you, sir\a151 ah, yes, Dr. Watson\a151 if you would have the goodness to put the Japanese vase to one side. You see round me my little interests in life. My doctor lectures me about never going out, but why should I go out when I have so much to hold me here? I can assure you that the adequate cataloguing of one of those cabinets would take me three good months.\a148Holmes looked round him with curiosity.\a147But do you tell me that you never go out?\a148 he said.\a147Now and again I drive down to Sotheby\a146s or Christie\a146s. Otherwise I very seldom leave my room. I am not too strong, and my researches are very absorbing. But you can imagine, Mr. Holmes, what a terrific shock\a151 pleasant but terrific\a151 it was for me when I heard of this unparalleled good fortune. It only needs one more Garrideb to complete the matter, and surely we can find one. I had a brother, but he is dead, and female relatives are disqualified. But there must surely be others in the world. I had heard that you handled strange cases, and that was why I sent to you. Of course, this American gentleman is quite right, and I should have taken his advice first, but I acted for the best.\a148\a147I think you acted very wisely indeed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But are you really anxious to acquire an estate in America?\a148\a147Certainly not, sir. Nothing would induce me to leave my collection. But this gentleman has assured me that he will buy me out as soon as we have established our claim. Five million dollars was the sum named. There are a dozen specimens in the market at the present moment which fill gaps in my collection, and which I am unable to purchase for want of a few hundred pounds. Just think what I could do with five million dollars. Why, I have the nucleus of a national collection. I shall be the Hans Sloane of my age.\a148His eyes gleamed behind his great spectacles. It was very clear that no pains would be spared by Mr. Nathan Garrideb in finding a namesake.\a147I merely called to make your acquaintance, and there is no reason why I should interrupt your studies,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I prefer to establish personal touch with those with whom I do business. There are few questions I need ask, for I have your very clear narrative in my pocket, and I filled up the blanks when this American gentleman called. I understand that up to this week you were unaware of his existence.\a148\a147That is so. He called last Tuesday.\a148\a147Did he tell you of our interview to-day?\a148\a147Yes, he came straight back to me. He had been very angry.\a148\a147Why should he be angry?\a148\a147He seemed to think it was some reflection on his honour. But he was quite cheerful again when he returned.\a148\a147Did he suggest any course of action?\a148\a147No, sir, he did not.\a148\a147Has he had, or asked for, any money from you?\a148\a147No, sir, never!\a148\a147You see no possible object he has in view?\a148\a147None, except what he states.\a148\a147Did you tell him of our telephone appointment?\a148\a147Yes, sir, I did.\a148Holmes was lost in thought. I could see that he was puzzled.\a147Have you any articles of great value in your collection?\a148\a147No, sir. I am not a rich man. It is a good collection, but not a very valuable one.\a148\a147You have no fear of burglars?\a148\a147Not the least.\a148\a147How long have you been in these rooms?\a148\a147Nearly five years.\a148Holmes\a146s cross-examination was interrupted by an imperative knocking at the door. No sooner had our client unlatched it than the American lawyer burst excitedly into the room.\a147Here you are!\a148 he cried, waving a paper over his head. \a147I thought I should be in time to get you. Mr. Nathan Garrideb, my congratulations! You are a rich man, sir. Our business is happily finished and all is well. As to you, Mr. Holmes, we can only say we are sorry if we have given you any useless trouble.\a148H\te handed over the paper to our client, who stood staring at a marked advertisement. Holmes and I leaned forward and read it over his shoulder. This is how it ran:HOWARD GARRIDEBCONSTRUCTOR OF ACRICULTURAL MACHINERYBinders, reapers, steam and hand plows, drills, harrows, farmer\a146s carts, buckboards, and all other appliances.Estimates for Artesian WellsApply Grosvenor Buildings, Aston\t\a147Glorious!\a148 gasped our host. \a147That makes our third man.\a148\a147I had opened up inquiries in Birmingham,\a148 said the American, \a147and my agent there has sent me this advertisement from a local paper. We must hustle and put the thing through. I have written to this man and told him that you will see him in his office to-morrow afternoon at four o\a146clock.\a148\a147You want me to see him?\a148\a147What do you say, Mr. Holmes? Don\a146t you think it would be wiser? Here am I, a wandering American with a wonderful tale. Why should he believe what I tell him? But you are a Britisher with solid references, and he is bound to take notice of what you say. I would go with you if you wished, but I have a very busy day to-morrow, and I could always follow you if you are in any trouble.\a148\a147Well, I have not made such a journey for years.\a148\a147It is nothing, Mr. Garrideb. I have figured out our connections. You leave at twelve and should be there soon after two. Then you can be back the same night. All you have to do is to see this man, explain the matter, and get an affidavit of his existence. By the Lord!\a148 he added hotly, \a147considering I\a146ve come all the way from the centre of America, it is surely little enough if you go a hundred miles in order to put this matter through.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think what this gentleman says is very true.\a148Mr. Nathan Garrideb shrugged his shoulders with a disconsolate air. \a147Well, if you insist I shall go,\a148 said he. \a147It is certainly hard for me to refuse you anything, considering the glory of hope that you have brought into my life.\a148\a147Then that is agreed,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and no doubt you will let me have a report as soon as you can.\a148\a147I\a146ll see to that,\a148 said the American. \a147Well,\a148 he added looking at his watch, \a147I\a146ll have to get on. I\a146ll call to-morrow, Mr. Nathan, and see you off to Birmingham. Coming my way, Mr. Holmes? Well, then, good-bye, and we may have good news for you to-morrow night.\a148I noticed that my friend\a146s face cleared when the American left the room, and the look of thoughtful perplexity had vanished.\a147I wish I could look over your collection, Mr. Garrideb,\a148 said he. \a147In my profession all sorts of odd knowledge comes useful, and this room of yours is a storehouse of it.\a148Our client shone with pleasure and his eyes gleamed from behind his big glasses.\a147I had always heard, sir, that you were a very intelligent man,\a148 said he. \a147I could take you round now if you have the time.\a148\a147Unfortunately, I have not. But these specimens are so well labelled and classified that they hardly need your personal explanation. If I should be able to look in to-morrow, I presume that there would be no objection to my glancing over them?\a148\a147None at all. You are most welcome. The place will, of course, be shut up, but Mrs. Saunders is in the basement up to four o\a146clock and would let you in with her key.\a148\a147Well, I happen to be clear to-morrow afternoon. If you would say a word to Mrs. Saunders it would be quite in order. By the way, who is your house-agent?\a148Our client was amazed at the sudden question.\a147Holloway and Steele, in the Edgware Road. But why?\a148\a147I am a bit of an archaeologist myself when it comes to houses,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147I was wondering if this was Queen Anne or Georgian.\a148\a147Georgian, beyond doubt.\a148\a147Really. I should have thought a little earlier. However, it is easily ascertained. Well, good-bye, Mr. Garrideb, and may you have every success in your Birmingham journey.\a148The house-agent\a146s was close by, but we found that it was closed for the day, so we made our way back to Baker Street. It was not till after dinner that Holmes reverted to the subject.\a147Our little problem draws to a close,\a148 said he. \a147No doubt you have outlined the solution in your own mind.\a148\a147I can make neither head nor tail of it.\a148\a147The head is surely clear enough and the tail we should see to-morrow. Did you notice nothing curious about that advertisement?\a148\a147I saw that the word \a145plough\a146 was misspelt.\a148\a147Oh, you did notice that, did you? Come, Watson, you improve all the time. Yes, it was bad English but good American. The printer had set it up as received. Then the buckboards. That is American also. And artesian wells are commoner with them than with us. It was a typical American advertisement, but purporting to be from an English firm. What do you make of that?\a148\a147I can only suppose that this American lawyer put it in himself. What his object was I fail to understand.\a148\a147Well, there are alternative explanations. Anyhow, he wanted to get this good old fossil up to Birmingham. That is very clear. I might have told him that he was clearly going on a wild-goose chase, but, on second thoughts, it seemed better to clear the stage by letting him go. To-morrow, Watson\a151 well, to-morrow will speak for itself.\a148Holmes was up and out early. When he returned at lunchtime I noticed that his face was very grave.\a147This is a more serious matter than I had expected, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It is fair to tell you so, though I know it will only be an additional reason to you for running your head into danger. I should know my Watson by now. But there is danger, and you should know it.\a148\a147Well, it is not the first we have shared, Holmes. I hope it may not be the last. What is the particular danger this time?\a148\a147We are up against a very hard case. I have identified Mr. John Garrideb, Counsellor at Law. He is none other than \a145Killer\a146 Evans, of sinister and murderous reputation.\a148\a147I fear I am none the wiser.\a148\a147Ah, it is not part of your profession to carry about a portable Newgate Calendar in your memory. I have been down to see friend Lestrade at the Yard. There may be an occasional want of imaginative intuition down there, but they lead the world for thoroughness and method. I had an idea that we might get on the track of our American friend in their records. Sure enough, I found his chubby face smiling up at me from the rogues\a146 portrait gallery. \a145James Winter, alias Morecroft, alias Killer Evans,\a146 was the inscription below.\a148 Holmes drew an envelope from his pocket. \a147I scribbled down a few points from his dossier: Aged forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot three men in the States. Escaped from penitentiary through political influence. Came to London in 1893. Shot a man over cards in a night-club in the Waterloo Road in January, 1895. Man died, but he was shown to have been the aggressor in the row. Dead man was identified as Rodger Prescott, famous as forger and coiner in Chicago. Killer Evans released in 1901. Has been under police supervision since, but so far as known has led an honest life. Very dangerous man, usually carries arms and is prepared to use them. That is our bird, Watson\a151 a sporting bird, as you must admit.\a148\a147But what is his game?\a148\a147Well, it begins to define itself. I have been to the houseagent\a146s. Our client, as he told us, has been there five years. It was unlet for a year before then. The previous tenant was a gentleman at large named Waldron. Waldron\a146s appearance was well remembered at the office. He had suddenly vanished and nothing more been heard of him. He was a tall, bearded man with very dark features. Now, Prescott, the man whom Killer Evans had shot, was, according to Scotland Yard, a tall, dark man with a beard. As a working hypothesis, I think we may take it that Prescott, the American criminal, used to live in the very room which our innocent friend now devotes to his museum. So at last we get a link, you see.\a148\a147And the next link?\a148\a147Well, we must go now and look for that.\a148He took a revolver from the drawer and handed it to me.\a147I have my old favourite with me. If our Wild West friend tries to live up to his nickname, we must be ready for him. I\a146ll give you an hour for a siesta, Watson, and then I think it will be time for our Ryder Street adventure.\a148It was just four o\a146clock when we reached the curious apartment of Nathan Garrideb. Mrs. Saunders, the caretaker, was about to leave, but she had no hesitation in admitting us, for the door shut with a spring lock, and Holmes promised to see that all was safe before we left. Shortly afterwards the outer door closed, her bonnet passed the bow window, and we knew that we were alone in the lower floor of the house. Holmes made a rapid examination of the premises. There was one cupboard in a dark corner which stood out a little from the wall. It was behind this that we eventually crouched while Holmes in a whisper outlined his intentions.\a147He wanted to get our amiable friend out of his room\a151 that is very clear, and, as the collector never went out, it took some planning to do it. The whole of this Garrideb invention was apparently for no other end. I must say, Watson, that there is a certain devilish ingenuity about it, even if the queer name of the tenant did give him an opening which he could hardly have expected. He wove his plot with remarkable cunning.\a146\a146\a147But what did he want?\a148\a147Well, that is what we are here to find out. It has nothing whatever to do with our client, so far as I can read the situation. It is something connected with the man he murdered\a151 the man who may have been his confederate in crime. There is some guilty secret in the room. That is how I read it. At first I thought our friend might have something in his collection more valuable than he knew\a151 something worth the attention of a big criminal. But the fact that Rodger Prescott of evil memory inhabited these rooms points to some deeper reason. Well, Watson, we can but possess our souls in patience and see what the hour may bring.\a148That hour was not long in striking. We crouched closer in the shadow as we heard the outer door open and shut. Then came the sharp, metallic snap of a key, and the American was in the room. He closed the door softly behind him, took a sharp glance around him to see that all was safe, threw off his overcoat, and walked up to the central table with the brisk manner of one who knows exactly what he has to do and how to do it. He pushed the table to one side, tore up the square of carpet on which it rested, rolled it completely back, and then, drawing a jemmy from his inside pocket, he knelt down and worked vigorously upon the floor. Presently we heard the sound of sliding boards, and an instant later a square had opened in the planks. Killer Evans struck a match, lit a stump of candle, and vanished from our view.Clearly our moment had come. Holmes touched my wrist as a signal, and together we stole across to the open trap-door. Gently as we moved, however, the old floor must have creaked under our feet, for the head of our American, peering anxiously round, emerged suddenly from the open space. His face turned upon us with a glare of baffled rage, which gradually softened into a rather shamefaced grin as he realized that two pistols were pointed at his head.\a147Well, well!\a148 said he coolly as he scrambled to the surface. \a147I guess you have been one too many for me, Mr. Holmes. Saw through my game, I suppose, and played me for a sucker from the first. Well, sir, I hand it to you; you have me beat and\a151\a148In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired two shots. I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes\a146s pistol came down on the man\a146s head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while Holmes rummaged him for weapons. Then my friend\a146s wiry arms were round me, and he was leading me to a chair.\a147You\a146re not hurt, Watson? For God\a146s sake, say that you are not hurt!\a148It was worth a wound\a151 it was worth many wounds\a151 to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.\a147It\a146s nothing, Holmes. It\a146s a mere scratch.\a148He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.\a147You are right,\a148 he cried with an immense sigh of relief. \a147It is quite superficial.\a148 His face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. \a147By the Lord, it is as well for you. If you had killed Watson, you would not have got out of this room alive. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?\a148He had nothing to say for himself. He only sat and scowled. I leaned on Holmes\a146s arm, and together we looked down into the small cellar which had been disclosed by the secret flap. It was still illuminated by the candle which Evans had taken down with him. Our eyes fell upon a mass of rusted machinery, great rolls of paper, a litter of bottles, and, neatly arranged upon a small table, a number of neat little bundles.\a147A printing press\a151 a counterfeiter\a146s outfit,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Yes, sir,\a148 said our prisoner, staggering slowly to his feet and then sinking into the chair. \a147The greatest counterfeiter London ever saw. That\a146s Prescott\a146s machine, and those bundles on the table are two thousand of Prescott\a146s notes worth a hundred each and fit to pass anywhere. Help yourselves, gentlemen. Call it a deal and let me beat it.\a148Holmes laughed.\a147We don\a146t do things like that, Mr. Evans. There is no bolthole for you in this country. You shot this man Prescott, did you not?\a148\a147Yes, sir, and got five years for it, though it was he who pulled on me. Five years\a151 when I should have had a medal the size of a soup plate. No living man could tell a Prescott from a Bank of England, and if I hadn\a146t put him out he would have flooded London with them. I was the only one in the world who knew where he made them. Can you wonder that I wanted to get to the place? And can you wonder that when I found this crazy boob of a bug-hunter with the queer name squatting right on the top of it, and never quitting his room, I had to do the best I could to shift him? Maybe I would have been wiser if I had put him away. It would have been easy enough, but I\a146m a soft-hearted guy that can\a146t begin shooting unless the other man has a gun also. But say, Mr. Holmes, what have I done wrong, anyhow? I\a146ve not used this plant. I\a146ve not hurt this old stiff. Where do you get me?\a148\a147Only attempted murder, so far as I can see,\a148 said Holmes. \a147But that\a146s not our job. They take that at the next stage. What we wanted at present was just your sweet self. Please give the Yard a call, Watson. It won\a146t be entirely unexpected.\a148So those were the facts about Killer Evans and his remarkable invention of the three Garridebs. We heard later that our poor old friend never got over the shock of his dissipated dreams. When his castle in the air fell down, it buried him beneath the ruins. He was last heard of at a nursing-home in Brixton. It was a glad day at the Yard when the Prescott outfit was discovered, for, though they knew that it existed, they had never been able, after the death of the man, to find out where it was. Evans had indeed done great service and caused several worthy C. I. D. men to sleep the sounder, for the counterfeiter stands in a class by himself as a public danger. They would willingly have subscribed to that soup-plate medal of which the criminal had spoken, but an unappreciative bench took a less favourable view, and the Killer returned to those shades from which he had just emerged.\p\X1\BThe Illustrious Client\B\X1\c\i\m="illu-05.png"\i\c\a147It can\a146t hurt now,\a148 was Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a146s comment when, for the tenth time in as many years, I asked his leave to reveal the following narrative. So it was that at last I obtained permission to put on record what was, in some ways, the supreme moment of my friend\a146s career.Both Holmes and I had a weakness for the Turkish bath. It was over a smoke in the pleasant lassitude of the drying-room that I have found him less reticent and more human than anywhere else. On the upper floor of the Northumberland Avenue establishment there is an isolated corner where two couches lie side by side, and it was on these that we lay upon September 3, 1902, the day when my narrative begins. I had asked him whether anything was stirring, and for answer he had shot his long, thin, nervous arm out of the sheets which enveloped him and had drawn an envelope from the inside pocket of the coat which hung beside him.\a147It may be some fussy, self-important fool; it may be a matter of life or death,\a148 said he as he handed me the note. \a147I know no more than this message tells me.\a148I\tt was from the Carlton Club and dated the evening before. This is what I read:\tS\tir James Damery presents his compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes and will call upon him at 4:30 to-morrow. Sir James begs to say that the matter upon which he desires to consult Mr. Holmes is very delicate and also very important. He trusts, therefore, that Mr. Holmes will make every effort to grant this interview, and that he will confirm it over the telephone to the Carlton Club. \t\a147I need not say that I have confirmed it, Watson,\a148 said Holmes as I returned the paper. \a147Do you know anything of this man Damery?\a148\a147Only that this name is a household word in society.\a148\a147Well, I can tell you a little more than that. He has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers. You may remember his negotiations with Sir George Lewis over the Hammerford Will case. He is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy. I am bound, therefore, to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our assistance.\a148\a147Our?\a148\a147Well, if you will be so good, Watson.\a148\a147I shall be honoured.\a148\a147Then you have the hour4:30. Until then we can put the matter out of our heads.\a148I was living in my own rooms in Queen Anne Street at the time, but I was round at Baker Street before the time named. Sharp to the half-hour, Colonel Sir James Damery was announced. It is hardly necessary to describe him, for many will remember that large, bluff, honest personality, that broad, cleanshaven face, and, above all, that pleasant, mellow voice. Frankness shone from his grey Irish eyes, and good humour played round his mobile, smiling lips. His lucent top-hat, his dark frock-coat, indeed, every detail, from the pearl pin in the black satin cravat to the lavender spats over the varnished shoes, spoke of the meticulous care in dress for which he was famous. The big, masterful aristocrat dominated the little room.\a147Of course, I was prepared to find Dr. Watson,\a148 he remarked with a courteous bow. \a147His collaboration may be very necessary, for we are dealing on this occasion, Mr. Holmes, with a man to whom violence is familiar and who will, literally, stick at nothing. I should say that there is no more dangerous man in Europe.\a148\a147I have had several opponents to whom that flattering term has been applied,\a148 said Holmes with a smile. \a147Don\a146t you smoke? Then you will excuse me if I light my pipe. If your man is more dangerous than the late Professor Moriarty, or than the living Colonel Sebastian Moran, then he is indeed worth meeting. May I ask his name?\a148\a147Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?\a148\a147You mean the Austrian murderer?\a148Colonel Damery threw up his kid-gloved hands with a laugh. \a147There is no getting past you, Mr. Holmes! Wonderful! So you have already sized him up as a murderer?\a148\a147It is my business to follow the details of Continental crime. Who could possibly have read what happened at Prague and have any doubts as to the man\a146s guilt! It was a purely technical legal point and the suspicious death of a witness that saved him! I am as sure that he killed his wife when the so-called \a145accident\a146 happened in the Splugen Pass as if I had seen him do it. I knew, also, that he had come to England and had a presentiment that sooner or later he would find me some work to do. Well, what has Baron Gruner been up to? I presume it is not this old tragedy which has come up again?\a148\a147No, it is more serious than that. To revenge crime is important, but to prevent it is more so. It is a terrible thing, Mr. Holmes, to see a dreadful event, an atrocious situation, preparing itself before your eyes, to clearly understand whither it will lead and yet to be utterly unable to avert it. Can a human being be placed in a more trying position?\a148\a147Perhaps not.\a148\a147Then you will sympathise with the client in whose interests I am acting.\a148\a147I did not understand that you were merely an intermediary. Who is the principal?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes, I must beg you not to press that question. It is important that I should be able to assure him that his honoured name has been in no way dragged into the matter. His motives are, to the last degree, honourable and chivalrous, but he prefers to remain unknown. I need not say that your fees will be assured and that you will be given a perfectly free hand. Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial?\a148\a147I am sorry,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I am accustomed to have mystery at one end of my cases, but to have it at both ends is too confusing. I fear, Sir James, that I must decline to act.\a148Our visitor was greatly disturbed. His large, sensitive face was darkened with emotion and disappointment.\a147You hardly realize the effect of your own action, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he. \a147You place me in a most serious dilemma for I am perfectly certain that you would be proud to take over the case if I could give you the facts, and yet a promise forbids me from revealing them all. May I, at least, lay all that I can before you?\a148\a147By all means, so long as it is understood that I commit myself to nothing.\a148\a147That is understood. In the first place, you have no doubt heard of General de Merville?\a148\a147De Merville of Khyber fame? Yes, I have heard of him.\a148\a147He has a daughter, Violet de Merville, young, rich, beautiful, accomplished, a wonder-woman in every way. It is this daughter, this lovely, innocent girl, whom we are endeavouring to save from the clutches of a fiend.\a148\a147Baron Gruner has some hold over her, then?\a148\a147The strongest of all holds where a woman is concerned\a151 the hold of love. The fellow is, as you may have heard, extraordinarily handsome, with a most fascinating manner, a gentle voice and that air of romance and mystery which means so much to a woman. He is said to have the whole sex at his mercy and to have made ample use of the fact.\a148\a147But how came such a man to meet a lady of the standing of Miss Violet de Merville?\a148\a147It was on a Mediterranean yachting voyage. The company, though select, paid their own passages. No doubt the promoters hardly realized the Baron\a146s true character until it was too late. The villain attached himself to the lady, and with such effect that he has completely and absolutely won her heart. To say that she loves him hardly expresses it. She dotes upon him, she is obsessed by him. Outside of him there is nothing on earth. She will not hear one word against him. Everything has been done to cure her of her madness, but in vain. To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month. As she is of age and has a will of iron, it is hard to know how to prevent her.\a148\a147Does she know about the Austrian episode?\a148\a147The cunning devil has told her every unsavoury public scandal of his past life, but always in such a way as to make himself out to be an innocent martyr. She absolutely accepts his version and will listen to no other.\a148\a147Dear me! But surely you have inadvertently let out the name of your client? It is no doubt General de Merville.\a148Our visitor fidgeted in his chair.\a147I could deceive you by saying so, Mr. Holmes, but it would not be true. De Merville is a broken man. The strong soldier has been utterly demoralised by this incident. He has lost the nerve which never failed him on the battlefield and has become a weak, doddering old man, utterly incapable of contending with a brilliant, forceful rascal like this Austrian. My client however is an old friend, one who has known the General intimately for many years and taken a paternal interest in this young girl since she wore short frocks. He cannot see this tragedy consummated without some attempt to stop it. There is nothing in which Scotland Yard can act. It was his own suggestion that you should be called in, but it was, as I have said, on the express stipulation that he should not be personally involved in the matter. I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes, with your great powers you could easily trace my client back through me, but I must ask you, as a point of honour, to refrain from doing so, and not to break in upon his incognito.\a148Holmes gave a whimsical smile.\a147I think I may safely promise that,\a148 said he. \a147I may add that your problem interests me, and that I shall be prepared to look into it. How shall I keep in touch with you?\a148\a147The Carlton Club will find me. But in case of emergency, there is a private telephone call, \a145XX.31.\a146\a160\a148Holmes noted it down and sat, still smiling, with the open memorandum-book upon his knee.\a147The Baron\a146s present address, please?\a148\a147Vernon Lodge, near Kingston. It is a large house. He has been fortunate in some rather shady speculations and is a rich man, which naturally makes him a more dangerous antagonist.\a148\a147Is he at home at present?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Apart from what you have told me, can you give me any further information about the man?\a148\a147He has expensive tastes. He is a horse fancier. For a short time he played polo at Hurlingham, but then this Prague affair got noised about and he had to leave. He collects books and pictures. He is a man with a considerable artistic side to his nature. He is, I believe, a recognised authority upon Chinese pottery and has written a book upon the subject.\a148\a147A complex mind,\a148 said Holmes. \a147All great criminals have that. My old friend Charlie Peace was a violin virtuoso. Wainwright was no mean artist. I could quote many more. Well, Sir James, you will inform your client that I am turning my mind upon Baron Gruner. I can say no more. I have some sources of information of my own, and I dare say we may find some means of opening the matter up.\a148When our visitor had left us Holmes sat so long in deep thought that it seemed to me that he had forgotten my presence. At last, however, he came briskly back to earth.\a147Well, Watson, any views?\a148 he asked.\a147I should think you had better see the young lady herself.\a148\a147My dear Watson, if her poor old broken father cannot move her, how shall I, a stranger, prevail? And yet there is something in the suggestion if all else fails. But I think we must begin from a different angle. I rather fancy that Shinwell Johnson might be a help.\a148I have not had occasion to mention Shinwell Johnson in these memoirs because I have seldom drawn my cases from the latter phases of my friend\a146s career . During the first years of the century he became a valuable assistant. Johnson, I grieve to say, made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms at Parkhurst. Finally he repented and allied himself to Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of London and obtaining information which often proved to be of vital importance. Had Johnson been a \a147nark\a148 of the police he would soon have been exposed, but as he dealt with cases which never came directly into the courts, his activities were never realized by his companions. With the glamour of his two convictions upon him, he had the entree of every night-club, doss house, and gambling-den in the town, and his quick observation and active brain made him an ideal agent for gaining information. It was to him that Sherlock Holmes now proposed to turn.It was not possible for me to follow the immediate steps taken by my friend, for I had some pressing professional business of my own, but I met him by appointment that evening at Simpson\a146s, where, sitting at a small table in the front window and looking down at the rushing stream of life in the Strand, he told me something of what had passed.\a147Johnson is on the prowl,\a148 said he. \a147He may pick up some garbage in the darker recesses of the underworld, for it is down there, amid the black roots of crime, that we must hunt for this man\a146s secrets.\a148\a147But if the lady will not accept what is already known, why should any fresh discovery of yours turn her from her purpose?\a148\a147Who knows, Watson? Woman\a146s heart and mind are insoluble puzzles to the male. Murder might be condoned or explained, and yet some smaller offence might rankle. Baron Gruner remarked to me\a151\a148\a147He remarked to you!\a148\a147Oh, to be sure, I had not told you of my plans. Well, Watson, I love to come to close grips with my man. I like to meet him eye to eye and read for myself the stuff that he is made of. When I had given Johnson his instructions I took a cab out to Kingston and found the Baron in a most affable mood.\a148\a147Did he recognise you?\a148\a147There was no difficulty about that, for I simply sent in my card. He is an excellent antagonist, cool as ice, silky voiced and soothing as one of your fashionable consultants, and poisonous as a cobra. He has breeding in him\a151 a real aristocrat of crime with a superficial suggestion of afternoon tea and all the cruelty of the grave behind it. Yes, I am glad to have had my attention called to Baron Adelbert Gruner.\a148\a147You say he was affable?\a148\a147A purring cat who thinks he sees prospective mice. Some people\a146s affability is more deadly than the violence of coarser souls. His greeting was characteristic. \a145I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he. \a145You have been engaged, no doubt by General de Merville, to endeavour to stop my marriage with his daughter, Violet. That is so, is it not?\a146I acquiesced.\a147\a160\a145My dear man,\a146 said he. \a145you will only ruin your own well-deserved reputation. It is not a case in which you can possibly succeed. You will have barren work, to say nothing of incurring some danger. Let me very strongly advise you to draw off at once.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is curious,\a146 I answered, \a145but that was the very advice which I had intended to give you. I have a respect for your brains, Baron, and the little which I have seen of your personality has not lessened it. Let me put it to you as man to man. No one wants to rake up your past and make you unduly uncomfortable. It is over, and you are now in smooth waters, but if you persist in this marriage you will raise up a swarm of powerful enemies who will never leave you alone until they have made England too hot to hold you. Is the game worth it? Surely you would be wiser if you left the lady alone. It would not be pleasant for you if these facts of your past were brought to her notice.\a146\a147The Baron has little waxed tips of hair under his nose, like the short antennae of an insect. These quivered with amusement as he listened, and he finally broke into a gentle chuckle.\a147\a160\a145Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, \a145but it is really funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. I don\a146t think anyone could do it better, but it is rather pathetic all the same. Not a colour card there, Mr. Holmes, nothing but the smallest of the small.\a146\a147\a160\a145So you think.\a146\a147\a160\a145So I know. Let me make the thing clear to you, for my own hand is so strong that I can afford to show it. I have been fortunate enough to win the entire affection of this lady. This was given to me in spite of the fact that I told her very clearly of all the unhappy incidents in my past life. I also told her that certain wicked and designing persons\a151 I hope you recognise yourself\a151 would come to her and tell her these things, and I warned her how to treat them. You have heard of post-hypnotic suggestion. Mr. Holmes \a145 Well you will see how it works for a man of personality can use hypnotism without any vulgar passes or tomfoolery. So she is ready for you and, I have no doubt, would give you an appointment, for she is quite amenable to her father\a146s will\a151 save only in the one little matter.\a146\a147Well, Watson, there seemed to be no more to say, so I took my leave with as much cold dignity as I could summon, but, as I had my hand on the door-handle, he stopped me.\a147\a160\a145By the way, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said he, \a145did you know Le Brun, the French agent?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Do you know what befell him?\a146\a147\a160\a145I heard that he was beaten by some Apaches in the Montmartre district and crippled for life.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite true, Mr. Holmes. By a curious coincidence he had been inquiring into my affairs only a week before. Don\a146t do it, Mr. Holmes; it\a146s not a lucky thing to do. Several have found that out. My last word to you is, go your own way and let me go mine. Good-bye!\a146\a147So there you are, Watson. You are up to date now.\a148\a147The fellow seems dangerous.\a148\a147Mighty dangerous. I disregard the blusterer, but this is the sort of man who says rather less than he means.\a148\a147Must you interfere? Does it really matter if he marries the girl?\a148\a147Considering that he undoubtedly murdered his last wife, I should say it mattered very much. Besides, the client! Well, well, we need not discuss that. When you have finished your coffee you had best come home with me, for the blithe Shinwell will be there with his report.\a148We found him sure enough, a huge, coarse, red-faced, scorbutic man, with a pair of vivid black eyes which were the only external sign of the very cunning mind within. It seems that he had dived down into what was peculiarly his kingdom, and beside him on the settee was a brand which he had brought up in the shape of a slim, flame-like young woman with a pale, intense face, youthful, and yet so worn with sin and sorrow that one read the terrible years which had left their leprous mark upon her.\a147This is Miss Kitty Winter,\a148 said Shinwell Johnson, waving his fat hand as an introduction. \a147What she don\a146t know\a151 well, there, she\a146ll speak for herself. Put my hand right on her, Mr. Holmes, within an hour of your message.\a148\a147I\a146m easy to find,\a148 said the young woman. \a147Hell, London, gets me every time. Same address for Porky Shinwell. We\a146re old mates, Porky, you and I. But, by cripes! there is another who ought to be down in a lower hell than we if there was any justice in the world! That is the man you are after, Mr. Holmes.\a148Holmes smiled. \a147I gather we have your good wishes, Miss Winter.\a148\a147If I can help to put him where he belongs, I\a146m yours to the rattle,\a148 said our visitor with fierce energy. There was an intensity of hatred in her white, set face and her blazing eyes such as woman seldom and man never can attain.\a147You needn\a146t go into my past, Mr. Holmes. That\a146s neither here nor there. But what I am Adelbert Gruner made me. If I could pull him down!\a148 She clutched frantically with her hands into the air. \a147Oh, if I could only pull him into the pit where he has pushed so many!\a148\a147You know how the matter stands?\a148\a147Porky Shinwell has been telling me. He\a146s after some other poor fool and wants to marry her this time. You want to stop it. Well, you surely know enough about this devil to prevent any decent girl in her senses wanting to be in the same parish with him.\a148\a147She is not in her senses. She is madly in love. She has been told all about him. She cares nothing.\a148\a147Told about the murder?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147My Lord, she must have a nerve!\a148\a147She puts them all down as slanders.\a148\a147Couldn\a146t you lay proofs before her silly eyes?\a148\a147Well, can you help us do so?\a148\a147Ain\a146t I a proof myself? If I stood before her and told her how he used me\a151\a148\a147Would you do this?\a148\a147Would I? Would I not!\a148\a147Well, it might be worth trying. But he has told her most of his sins and had pardon from her, and I understand she will not reopen the question.\a148\a147I\a146ll lay he didn\a146t tell her all,\a148 said Miss Winter. \a147I caught a glimpse of one or two murders besides the one that made such a fuss. He would speak of someone in his velvet way and then look at me with a steady eye and say: \a145He died within a month.\a146 It wasn\a146t hot air, either. But I took little notice\a151 you see, I loved him myself at that time. Whatever he did went with me, same as with this poor fool! There was just one thing that shook me. Yes, by cripes! if it had not been for his poisonous, lying tongue that explains and soothes. I\a146d have left him that very night. It\a146s a book he has\a151 a brown leather book with a lock, and his arms in gold on the outside. I think he was a bit drunk that night, or he would not have shown it to me.\a148\a147What was it, then?\a148\a147I tell you, Mr. Holmes, this man collects women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or butterflies. He had it all in that book. Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. It was a beastly book\a151 a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could have put together. But it was Adelbert Gruner\a146s book all the same. \a145Souls I have ruined.\a146 He could have put that on the outside if he had been so minded. However, that\a146s neither here nor there, for the book would not serve you, and, if it would, you can\a146t get it.\a148\a147Where is it?\a148\a147How can I tell you where it is now? It\a146s more than a year since I left him. I know where he kept it then. He\a146s a precise, tidy cat of a man in many of his ways, so maybe it is still in the pigeon-hole of the old bureau in the inner study. Do you know his house?\a148\a147I\a146ve been in the study,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Have you, though? You haven\a146t been slow on the job if you only started this morning. Maybe dear Adelbert has met his match this time. The outer study is the one with the Chinese crockery in it\a151 big glass cupboard between the windows. Then behind his desk is the door that leads to the inner study\a151 a small room where he keeps papers and things.\a148\a147Is he not afraid of burglars?\a148\a147Adelbert is no coward. His worst enemy couldn\a146t say that of him. He can look after himself. There\a146s a burglar alarm at night. Besides, what is there for a burglar\a151 unless they got away with all this fancy crockery?\a148\a147No good,\a148 said Shinwell Johnson with the decided voice of the expert. \a147No fence wants stuff of that sort that you can neither melt nor sell.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Well, now, Miss Winter, if you would call here tomorrow evening at five. I would consider in the meanwhile whether your suggestion of seeing this lady personally may not be arranged. I am exceedingly obliged to you for your cooperation. I need not say that my clients will consider liberally\a151\a148\a147None of that, Mr. Holmes,\a148 cried the young woman. \a147I am not out for money. Let me see this man in the mud, and I\a146ve got all I\a146ve worked for\a151 in the mud with my foot on his cursed face. That\a146s my price. I\a146m with you tomorrow or any other day so long as you are on his track. Porky here can tell you always where to find me.\a148I did not see Holmes again until the following evening when we dined once more at our Strand restaurant. He shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what luck he had had in his interview. Then he told the story, which I would repeat in this way. His hard, dry statement needs some little editing to soften it into the terms of real life.\a147There was no difficulty at all about the appointment,\a148 said Holmes, \a147for the girl glories in showing abject filial obedience in all secondary things in an attempt to atone for her flagrant breach of it in her engagement. The General phoned that all was ready, and the fiery Miss W. turned up according to schedule, so that at half-past five a cab deposited us outside 104 Berkeley Square, where the old soldier resides\a151 one of those awful grey London castles which would make a church seem frivolous. A footman showed us into a great yellow-curtained drawing-room, and there was the lady awaiting us, demure, pale, self-contained, as inflexible and remote as a snow image on a mountain.\a147I don\a146t quite know how to make her clear to you, Watson. Perhaps you may meet her before we are through, and you can use your own gift of words. She is beautiful, but with the ethereal other-world beauty of some fanatic whose thoughts are set on high. I have seen such faces in the pictures of the old masters of the Middle Ages. How a beastman could have laid his vile paws upon such a being of the beyond I cannot imagine. You may have noticed how extremes call to each other, the spiritual to the animal, the cave-man to the angel. You never saw a worse case than this.\a147She knew what we had come for, of course\a151 that villain had lost no time in poisoning her mind against us. Miss Winter\a146s advent rather amazed her, I think, but she waved us into our respective chairs like a reverend abbess receiving two rather leprous mendicants. If your head is inclined to swell, my dear Watson, take a course of Miss Violet de Merville.\a147\a160\a145Well, sir,\a146 said she in a voice like the wind from an iceberg, \a145your name is familiar to me. You have called, as I understand, to malign my \ifianc\a233\i, Baron Gruner. It is only by my father\a146s request that I see you at all, and I warn you in advance that anything you can say could not possibly have the slightest effect upon my mind.\a146\a147I was sorry for her, Watson. I thought of her for the moment as I would have thought of a daughter of my own. I am not often eloquent. I use my head, not my heart. But I really did plead with her with all the warmth of words that I could find in my nature. I pictured to her the awful position of the woman who only wakes to a man\a146s character after she is his wife\a151 a woman who has to submit to be caressed by bloody hands and lecherous lips. I spared her nothing\a151 the shame, the fear, the agony, the hopelessness of it all. All my hot words could not bring one tinge of colour to those ivory cheeks or one gleam of emotion to those abstracted eyes. I thought of what the rascal had said about a post-hypnotic influence. One could really believe that she was living above the earth in some ecstatic dream. Yet there was nothing indefinite in her replies.\a147\a160\a145I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes,\a146 said she. \a145The effect upon my mind is exactly as predicted. I am aware that Adelbert, that my \ifianc\a233\i, has had a stormy life in which he has incurred bitter hatreds and most unjust aspersions. You are only the last of a series who have brought their slanders before me. Possibly you mean well, though I learn that you are a paid agent who would have been equally willing to act for the Baron as against him. But in any case I wish you to understand once for all that I love him and that he loves me, and that the opinion of all the world is no more to me than the twitter of those birds outside the window. If his noble nature has ever for an instant fallen, it may be that I have been specially sent to raise it to its true and lofty level. I am not clear\a146, here she turned eyes upon my companion, \a145who this young lady may be.\a146\a147I was about to answer when the girl broke in like a whirlwind. If ever you saw flame and ice face to face, it was those two women.\a147\a160\a145I\a146ll tell you who I am,\a146 she cried, springing out of her chair, her mouth all twisted with passion\a151\a145I am his last mistress. I am one of a hundred that he has tempted and used and ruined and thrown into the refuse heap, as he will you also. Your refuse heap is more likely to be a grave, and maybe that\a146s the best. I tell you, you foolish woman, if you marry this man he\a146ll be the death of you. It may be a broken heart or it may be a broken neck, but he\a146ll have you one way or the other. It\a146s not out of love for you I\a146m speaking. I don\a146t care a tinker\a146s curse whether you live or die. It\a146s out of hate for him and to spite him and to get back on him for what he did to me. But it\a146s all the same, and you needn\a146t look at me like that, my fine lady, for you may be lower than I am before you are through with it.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should prefer not to discuss such matters,\a146 said Miss de Merville coldly. \a145Let me say once for all that I am aware of three passages in my \ifianc\a233\a146s\i life in which he became entangled with designing women, and that I am assured of his hearty repentance for any evil that he may have done.\a146\a147\a160\a145Three passages!\a146 screamed my companion. \a145You fool! You unutterable fool!\a146\a147\a160\a145Mr. Holmes, I beg that you will bring this interview to an end,\a146 said the icy voice. \a145I have obeyed my father\a146s wish in seeing you, but I am not compelled to listen to the ravings of this person.\a146\a147With an oath Miss Winter darted forward, and if I had not caught her wrist she would have clutched this maddening woman by the hair. I dragged her towards the door and was lucky to get her back into the cab without a public scene, for she was beside herself with rage. In a cold way I felt pretty furious myself, Watson, for there was something indescribably annoying in the calm aloofness and supreme self-complaisance of the woman whom we were trying to save. So now once again you know exactly how we stand, and it is clear that I must plan some fresh opening move, for this gambit won\a146t work. I\a146ll keep in touch with you, Watson, for it is more than likely that you will have your part to play, though it is just possible that the next move may lie with them rather than with us.\a148And it did. Their blow fell\a151 or his blow rather, for never could I believe that the lady was privy to it. I think I could show you the very paving-stone upon which I stood when my eyes fell upon the placard, and a pang of horror passed through my very soul. It was between the Grand Hotel and Charing Cross Station, where a one-legged news-vender displayed his evening papers. The date was just two days after the last conversation. There, black upon yellow, was the terrible news-sheet:\c\iMURDEROUS ATTACK UPONSHERLOCK HOLMES\i\cI\t think I stood stunned for some moments. Then I have a confused recollection of snatching at a paper, of the remonstrance of the man, whom I had not paid, and, finally, of standing in the doorway of a chemist\a146s shop while I turned up the fateful paragraph. This was how it ran:\tW\te learn with regret that Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well-known private detective, was the victim this morning of a murderous assault which has left him in a precarious position. There are no exact details to hand, but the event seems to have occurred about twelve o\a146clock in Regent Street, outside the Cafe Royal. The attack was made by two men armed with sticks, and Mr. Holmes was beaten about the head and body, receiving injuries which the doctors describe as most serious. He was carried to Charing Cross Hospital and afterwards insisted upon being taken to his rooms in Baker Street. The miscreants who attacked him appear to have been respectably dressed men, who escaped from the bystanders by passing through the Cafe Royal and out into Glasshouse Street behind it. No doubt they belonged to that criminal fraternity which has so often had occasion to bewail the activity and ingenuity of the injured man.\tI need not say that my eyes had hardly glanced over the paragraph before I had sprung into a hansom and was on my way to Baker Street. I found Sir Leslie Oakshott, the famous surgeon, in the hall and his brougham waiting at the curb.\a147No immediate danger,\a148 was his report. \a147Two lacerated scalp wounds and some considerable bruises. Several stitches have been necessary. Morphine has been injected and quiet is essential, but an interview of a few minutes would not be absolutely forbidden.\a148With this permission I stole into the darkened room. The sufferer was wide awake, and I heard my name in a hoarse whisper. The blind was three-quarters down, but one ray of sunlight slanted through and struck the bandaged head of the injured man. A crimson patch had soaked through the white linen compress. I sat beside him and bent my head.\a147All right, Watson. Don\a146t look so scared,\a148 he muttered in a very weak voice. \a147It\a146s not as bad as it seems.\a148\a147Thank God for that!\a148\a147I\a146m a bit of a single-stick expert, as you know. I took most of them on my guard. It was the second man that was too much for me.\a148\a147What can I do, Holmes? Of course, it was that damned fellow who set them on. I\a146ll go and thrash the hide off him if you give the word.\a148\a147Good old Watson! No, we can do nothing there unless the police lay their hands on the men. But their get-away had been well prepared. We may be sure of that. Wait a little. I have my plans. The first thing is to exaggerate my injuries. They\a146ll come to you for news. Put it on thick, Watson. Lucky if I live the week out concussion delirium\a151 what you like! You can\a146t overdo it.\a148\a147But Sir Leslie Oakshott?\a148\a147Oh, he\a146s all right. He shall see the worst side of me. I\a146ll look after that.\a148\a147Anything else?\a148\a147Yes. Tell Shinwell Johnson to get that girl out of the way. Those beauties will be after her now. They know, of course, that she was with me in the case. If they dared to do me in it is not likely they will neglect her. That is urgent. Do it to-night.\a148\a147I\a146ll go now. Anything more?\a148\a147Put my pipe on the table\a151 and the tobacco-slipper. Right! Come in each morning and we will plan our campaign.\a148I arranged with Johnson that evening to take Miss Winter to a quiet suburb and see that she lay low until the danger was past.For six days the public were under the impression that Holmes was at the door of death. The bulletins were very grave and there were sinister paragraphs in the papers. My continual visits assured me that it was not so bad as that. His wiry constitution and his determined will were working wonders. He was recovering fast, and I had suspicions at times that he was really finding himself faster than he pretended even to me. There was a curious secretive streak in the man which led to many dramatic effects, but left even his closest friend guessing as to what his exact plans might be. He pushed to an extreme the axiom that the only safe plotter was he who plotted alone. I was nearer him than anyone else, and yet I was always conscious of the gap between.On the seventh day the stitches were taken out, in spite of which there was a report of erysipelas in the evening papers. The same evening papers had an announcement which I was bound, sick or well, to carry to my friend. It was simply that among the passengers on the Cunard boat \iRuritania\i, starting from Liverpool on Friday, was the Baron Adelbert Gruner, who had some important financial business to settle in the States before his impending wedding to Miss Violet de Merville, only daughter of, etc., etc. Holmes listened to the news with a cold, concentrated look upon his pale face, which told me that it hit him hard.\a147Friday!\a148 he cried. \a147Only three clear days. I believe the rascal wants to put himself out of danger\a146s way. But he won\a146t, Watson! By the Lord Harry, he won\a146t! Now, Watson, I want you to do something for me.\a148\a147I am here to be used, Holmes.\a148\a147Well, then, spend the next twenty-four hours in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.\a148He gave no explanations and I asked for none. By long experience I had learned the wisdom of obedience. But when I had left his room I walked down Baker Street, revolving in my head how on earth I was to carry out so strange an order. Finally I drove to the London Library in St. James\a146s Square, put the matter to my friend Lomax, the sublibrarian, and departed to my rooms with a goodly volume under my arm.It is said that the barrister who crams up a case with such care that he can examine an expert witness upon the Monday has forgotten all his forced knowledge before the Saturday. Certainly I should not like now to pose as an authority upon ceramics. And yet all that evening, and all that night with a short interval for rest, and all next morning, I was sucking in knowledge and committing names to memory. There I learned of the hall-marks of the great artist-decorators, of the mystery of cyclical dates, the marks of the Hung-wu and the beauties of the Yung-lo, the writings of Tang-ying, and the glories of the primitive period of the Sung and the Yuan. I was charged with all this information when I called upon Holmes next evening. He was out of bed now, though you would not have guessed it from the published reports, and he sat with his much-bandaged head resting upon his hand in the depth of his favourite armchair.\a147Why, Holmes,\a148 I said, \a147if one believed the papers, you are dying. \a148\a147That,\a148 said he, \a147is the very impression which I intended to convey. And now, Watson, have you learned your lessons?\a148\a147At least I have tried to.\a148\a147Good. You could keep up an intelligent conversation on the subject?\a148\a147I believe I could.\a148\a147Then hand me that little box from the mantelpiece.\a148He opened the lid and took out a small object most carefully wrapped in some fine Eastern silk. This he unfolded, and disclosed a delicate little saucer of the most beautiful deep-blue colour.\a147It needs careful handling, Watson. This is the real egg-shell pottery of the Ming dynasty. No finer piece ever passed through Christie\a146s. A complete set of this would be worth a king\a146s ransom\a151 in fact, it is doubtful if there is a complete set outside the imperial palace of Peking. The sight of this would drive a real connoisseur wild.\a148\a147What am I to do with it?\a148Holmes handed me a card upon which was printed: \a147Dr. Hill Barton, 369 Half Moon Street.\a148\a147That is your name for the evening, Watson. You will call upon Baron Gruner. I know something of his habits, and at half-past eight he would probably be disengaged. A note will tell him in advance that you are about to call, and you will say that you are bringing him a specimen of an absolutely unique set of Ming china. You may as well be a medical man, since that is a part which you can play without duplicity. You are a collector this set has come your way, you have heard of the Baron\a146s interest in the subject, and you are not averse to selling at a price.\a148\a147What price?\a148\a147Well asked, Watson. You would certainly fall down badly if you did not know the value of your own wares. This saucer was got for me by Sir James, and comes, I understand, from the collection of his client. You will not exaggerate if you say that it could hardly be matched in the world.\a148\a147I could perhaps suggest that the set should be valued by an expert.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! You scintillate to-day. Suggest Christie or Sotheby. Your delicacy prevents your putting a price for yourself.\a148\a147But if he won\a146t see me?\a148\a147Oh, yes, he will see you. He has the collection mania in its most acute form\a151 and especially on this subject, on which he is an acknowledged authority. Sit down, Watson, and I will dictate the letter. No answer needed. You will merely say that you are coming, and why.\a148It was an admirable document, short, courteous, and stimulating to the curiosity of the connoisseur. A district messenger was duly dispatched with it. On the same evening, with the precious saucer in my hand and the card of Dr. Hill Barton in my pocket, I set off on my own adventure.The beautiful house and grounds indicated that Baron Gruner was, as Sir James had said, a man of considerable wealth. A long winding drive, with banks of rare shrubs on either side, opened out into a great gravelled square adorned with statues. The place had been built by a South African gold king in the days of the great boom, and the long, low house with the turrets at the corners, though an architectural nightmare, was imposing in its size and solidity. A butler, who would have adorned a bench of bishops, showed me in and handed me over to a plush-clad footman, who ushered me into the Baron\a146s presence.He was standing at the open front of a great case which stood between the windows and which contained part of his Chinese collection. He turned as I entered with a small brown vase in his hand.\a147Pray sit down, Doctor,\a148 said he. \a147I was looking over my own treasures and wondering whether I could really afford to add to them. This little Tang specimen, which dates from the seventh century, would probably interest you. I am sure you never saw finer workmanship or a richer glaze. Have you the Ming saucer with you of which you spoke?\a148I carefully unpacked it and handed it to him. He seated himself at his desk, pulled over the lamp, for it was growing dark, and set himself to examine it. As he did so the yellow light beat upon his own features, and I was able to study them at my ease.He was certainly a remarkably handsome man. His European reputation for beauty was fully deserved. In figure he was not more than of middle size, but was built upon graceful and active lines. His face was swarthy, almost Oriental, with large, dark, languorous eyes which might easily hold an irresistible fascination for women. His hair and moustache were raven black, the latter short, pointed, and carefully waxed. His features were regular and pleasing, save only his straight, thin-lipped mouth. If ever I saw a murderer\a146s mouth it was there\a151 a cruel, hard gash in the face, compressed, inexorable, and terrible. He was ill-advised to train his moustache away from it, for it was Nature\a146s danger-signal, set as a warning to his victims. His voice was engaging and his manners perfect. In age I should have put him at little over thirty, though his record afterwards showed that he was forty-two.\a147Very fine\a151 very fine indeed!\a148 he said at last. \a147And you say you have a set of six to correspond. What puzzles me is that I should not have heard of such magnificent specimens. I only know of one in England to match this, and it is certainly not likely to be in the market. Would it be indiscreet if I were to ask you, Dr. Hill Barton, how you obtained this?\a148\a147Does it really matter?\a148 I asked with as careless an air as I could muster.\a147You can see that the piece is genuine, and, as to the value, I am content to take an expert\a146s valuation.\a148\a147Very mysterious,\a148 said he with a quick, suspicious flash of his dark eyes. \a147In dealing with objects of such value, one naturally wishes to know all about the transaction. That the piece is genuine is certain. I have no doubts at all about that. But suppose\a151 I am bound to take every possibility into account\a151 that it should prove afterwards that you had no right to sell?\a148\a147I would guarantee you against any claim of the sort.\a148\a147That, of course, would open up the question as to what your guarantee was worth.\a148\a147My bankers would answer that.\a148\a147Quite so. And yet the whole transaction strikes me as rather unusual.\a148\a147You can do business or not,\a148 said I with indifference. \a147I have given you the first offer as I understood that you were a connoisseur, but I shall have no difficulty in other quarters.\a148\a147Who told you I was a connoisseur?\a148\a147I was aware that you had written a book upon the subject.\a148\a147Have you read the book?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Dear me, this becomes more and more difficult for me to understand! You are a connoisseur and collector with a very valuable piece in your collection, and yet you have never troubled to consult the one book which would have told you of the real meaning and value of what you held. How do you explain that?\a148\a147I am a very busy man. I am a doctor in practice.\a148\a147That is no answer. If a man has a hobby he follows it up, whatever his other pursuits may be. You said in your note that you were a connoisseur.\a148\a147So I am.\a148\a147Might I ask you a few questions to test you? I am obliged to tell you, Doctor\a151 if you are indeed a doctor\a151 that the incident becomes more and more suspicious. I would ask you what do you know of the Emperor Shomu and how do you associate him with the Shoso-in near Nara? Dear me, does that puzzle you? Tell me a little about the Nonhern Wei dynasty and its place in the history of ceramics.\a148I sprang from my chair in simulated anger.\a147This is intolerable, sir,\a148 said I. \a147I came here to do you a favour, and not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy. My knowledge on these subjects may be second only to your own, but I certainly shall not answer questions which have been put in so offensive a way.\a148He looked at me steadily. The languor had gone from his eyes. They suddenly glared. There was a gleam of teeth from between those cruel lips.\a147What is the game? You are here as a spy. You are an emissary of Holmes. This is a trick that you are playing upon me. The fellow is dying I hear, so he sends his tools to keep watch upon me. You\a146ve made your way in here without leave, and, by God! you may find it harder to get out than to get in.\a148He had sprung to his feet, and I stepped back, bracing myself for an attack, for the man was beside himself with rage. He may have suspected me from the first; certainly this cross-examination had shown him the truth; but it was clear that I could not hope to deceive him. He dived his hand into a side-drawer and rummaged furiously. Then something struck upon his ear, for he stood listening intently.\a147Ah!\a148 he cried. \a147Ah!\a148 and dashed into the room behind him.Two steps took me to the open door, and my mind will ever carry a clear picture of the scene within. The window leading out to the garden was wide open. Beside it, looking like some terrible ghost, his head girt with bloody bandages, his face drawn and white, stood Sherlock Holmes. The next instant he was through the gap, and I heard the crash of his body among the laurel bushes outside. With a howl of rage the master of the house rushed after him to the open window.And then! It was done in an instant, and yet I clearly saw it. An arm\a151 a woman\a146s arm\a151 shot out from among the leaves. At the same instant the Baron uttered a horrible cry\a151 a yell which will always ring in my memory. He clapped his two hands to his face and rushed round the room, beating his head horribly against the walls. Then he fell upon the carpet, rolling and writhing, while scream after scream resounded through the house.\a147Water! For God\a146s sake, water!\a148 was his cry.I seized a carafe from a side-table and rushed to his aid. At the same moment the butler and several footmen ran in from the hall. I remember that one of them fainted as I knelt by the injured man and turned that awful face to the light of the lamp. The vitriol was eating into it everywhere and dripping from the ears and the chin. One eye was already white and glazed. The other was red and inflamed. The features which I had admired a few minutes before were now like some beautiful painting over which the artist has passed a wet and foul sponge. They were blurred, discoloured, inhuman, terrible.In a few words I explained exactly what had occurred, so far as the vitriol attack was concerned. Some had climbed through the window and others had rushed out on to the lawn, but it was dark and it had begun to rain. Between his screams the victim raged and raved against the avenger. \a147It was that hell-cat, Kitty Winter!\a148 he cried. \a147Oh, the she-devil! She shall pay for it! She shall pay! Oh, God in heaven, this pain is more than I can bear!\a148I bathed his face in oil, put cotton wadding on the raw surfaces, and administered a hypodermic of morphia. All suspicion of me had passed from his mind in the presence of this shock, and he clung to my hands as if I might have the power even yet to clear those dead-fish eyes which glazed up at me. I could have wept over the ruin had I not remembered very clearly the vile life which had led up to so hideous a change. It was loathsome to feel the pawing of his burning hands, and I was relieved when his family surgeon, closely followed by a specialist, came to relieve me of my charge. An inspector of police had also arrived, and to him I handed my real card. It would have been useless as well as foolish to do otherwise, for I was nearly as well known by sight at the Yard as Holmes himself. Then I left that house of gloom and terror. Within an hour I was at Baker Street.Holmes was seated in his familiar chair, looking very pale and exhausted. Apart from his injuries, even his iron nerves had been shocked by the events of the evening, and he listened with horror to my account of the Baron\a146s transformation.\a147The wages of sin, Watson\a151 the wages of sin!\a148 said he. \a147Sooner or later it will always come. God knows, there was sin enough,\a148 he added, taking up a brown volume from the table. \a147Here is the book the woman talked of. If this will not break off the marriage, nothing ever could. But it will, Watson. It must. No self-respecting woman could stand it.\a148\a147It is his love diary?\a148\a147Or his lust diary. Call it what you will. The moment the woman told us of it I realized what a tremendous weapon was there if we could but lay our hands on it. I said nothing at the time to indicate my thoughts, for this woman might have given it away. But I brooded over it. Then this assault upon me gave me the chance of letting the Baron think that no precautions need be taken against me. That was all to the good. I would have waited a little longer, but his visit to America forced my hand. He would never have left so compromising a document behind him. Therefore we had to act at once. Burglary at night is impossible. He takes precautions. But there was a chance in the evening if I could only be sure that his attention was engaged. That was where you and your blue saucer came in. But I had to be sure of the position of the book, and I knew I had only a few minutes in which to act, for my time was limited by your knowledge of Chinese pottery. Therefore I gathered the girl up at the last moment. How could I guess what the little packet was that she carried so carefully under her cloak? I thought she had come altogether on my business, but it seems she had some of her own.\a148\a147He guessed I came from you.\a148\a147I feared he would. But you held him in play just long enough for me to get the book, though not long enough for an unobserved escape. Ah, Sir James, I am very glad you have come!\a148Our courtly friend had appeared in answer to a previous summons. He listened with the deepest attention to Holmes\a146s account of what had occurred.\a147You have done wonders\a151 wonders!\a148 he cried when he had heard the narrative. \a147But if these injuries are as terrible as Dr. Watson describes, then surely our purpose of thwarting the marriage is sufficiently gained without the use of this horrible book.\a148Holmes shook his head.\a147Women of the De Merville type do not act like that. She would love him the more as a disfigured martyr. No, no. It is his moral side, not his physical, which we have to destroy. That book will bring her back to earth\a151 and I know nothing else that could. It is in his own writing. She cannot get past it.\a148Sir James carried away both it and the precious saucer. As I was myself overdue, I went down with him into the street. A brougham was waiting for him. He sprang in, gave a hurried order to the cockaded coachman, and drove swiftly away. He flung his overcoat half out of the window to cover the armorial bearings upon the panel, but I had seen them in the glare of our fanlight none the less. I gasped with surprise. Then I turned back and ascended the stair to Holmes\a146s room.\a147I have found out who our client is,\a148 I cried, bursting with my great news. \a147Why, Holmes, it is\a151\a148\a147It is a loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,\a148 said Holmes, holding up a restraining hand. \a147Let that now and forever be enough for us.\a148I do not know how the incriminating book was used. Sir James may have managed it. Or it is more probable that so delicate a task was entrusted to the young lady\a146s father. The effect, at any rate, was all that could be desired.Three days later appeared a paragraph in the Morning Post to say that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville would not take place. The same paper had the first police-court hearing of the proceedings against Miss Kitty Winter on the grave charge of vitriol-throwing. Such extenuating circumstances came out in the trial that the sentence, as will be remembered was the lowest that was possible for such an offence. Sherlock Holmes was threatened with a prosecution for burglary, but when an object is good and a client is sufficiently illustrious, even the rigid British law becomes human and elastic. My friend has not yet stood in the dock.\p\X1\BThe Three Gables\B\X1\c\i\m="3gab-01.png"\i\cI don\a146t think that any of my adventures with Mr. Sherlock Holmes opened quite so abruptly, or so dramatically, as that which I associate with The Three Gables. I had not seen Holmes for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed. He was in a chatty mood that morning, however, and had just settled me into the well-worn low armchair on one side of the fire, while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair, when our visitor arrived. If I had said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer impression of what occurred.The door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room. He would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific, for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a flowing salmon-coloured tie. His broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward, as his sullen dark eyes, with a smouldering gleam of malice in them, turned from one of us to the other.\a147Which of you gen\a146l\a146men is Masser Holmes?\a148 he asked.Holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile.\a147Oh! it\a146s you, is it?\a148 said our visitor, coming with an unpleasant, stealthy step round the angle of the table. \a147See here, Masser Holmes, you keep your hands out of other folks\a146 business. Leave folks to manage their own affairs. Got that, Masser Holmes?\a148\a147Keep on talking,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It\a146s fine.\a148\a147Oh! it\a146s fine, is it?\a148 growled the savage. \a147It won\a146t be so damn fine if I have to trim you up a bit. I\a146ve handled your kind before now, and they didn\a146t look fine when I was through with them. Look at that, Masser Holmes!\a148He swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friend\a146s nose. Holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest.\a147Were you born so?\a148 he asked. \a147Or did it come by degrees?\a148It may have been the icy coolness of my friend, or it may have been the slight clatter which I made as I picked up the poker. In any case, our visitor\a146s manner became less flamboyant.\a147Well, I\a146ve given you fair warnin\a146,\a148 said he. \a147I\a146ve a friend that\a146s interested out Harrow way\a151 you know what I\a146m meaning\a151 and he don\a146t intend to have no buttin\a146 in by you. Got that? You ain\a146t the law, and I ain\a146t the law either, and if you come in I\a146ll be on hand also. Don\a146t you forget it.\a148\a147I\a146ve wanted to meet you for some time,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I won\a146t ask you to sit down, for I don\a146t like the smell of you, but aren\a146t you Steve Dixie, the bruiser?\a148\a147That\a146s my name, Masser Holmes, and you\a146ll get put through it for sure if you give me any lip.\a148\a147It is certainly the last thing you need,\a148 said Holmes, staring at our visitor\a146s hideous mouth. \a147But it was the killing of young Perkins outside the Holborn\a151 Bar What! you\a146re not going?\a148The negro had sprung back, and his face was leaden. \a147I won\a146t listen to no such talk,\a148 said he. \a147What have I to do with this \a146ere Perkins, Masser Holmes? I was trainin\a146 at the Bull Ring in Birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble.\a148\a147Yes, you\a146ll tell the magistrate about it, Steve,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I\a146ve been watching you and Barney Stockdale\a151\a148\a147So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes\a151\a148\a147That\a146s enough. Get out of it. I\a146ll pick you up when I want you.\a148\a147Good-mornin\a146, Masser Holmes. I hope there ain\a146t no hard feelin\a146s about this \a146ere visit?\a148\a147There will be unless you tell me who sent you.\a148\a147Why, there ain\a146t no secret about that, Masser Holmes. It was that same gen\a146l\a146man that you have just done gone mention.\a148\a147And who set him on to it?\a148\a147S\a146elp me. I don\a146t know, Masser Holmes. He just say, \a145Steve, you go see Mr. Holmes, and tell him his life ain\a146t safe if he go down Harrow way.\a146 That\a146s the whole truth.\a148 Without waiting for any further questioning, our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered. Holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle.\a147I am glad you were not forced to break his woolly head, Watson. I observed your manoeuvres with the poker. But he is really rather a harmless fellow, a great muscular, foolish, blustering baby, and easily cowed, as you have seen. He is one of the Spencer John gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which I may clear up when I have time. His immediate principal, Barney, is a more astute person. They specialize in assaults, intimidation, and the like. What I want to know is, who is at the back of them on this particular occasion?\a148\a147But why do they want to intimidate you?\a148\a147It is this Harrow Weald case. It decides me to look into the matter, for if it is worth anyone\a146s while to take so much trouble, there must be something in it.\a148\a147But what is it?\a148\a147\tI was going to tell you when we had this comic interlude. Here is Mrs. Maberley\a146s note. If you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once.\a148\tD\tEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES [I read]:\tI\t have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house, and I should much value your advice. You would find me at home any time to-morrow. The house is within a short walk of the Weald Station. I believe that my late husband, Mortimer Maberley, was one of your early clients.\tY\tours faithfully, MARY MABERLEY. \tThe address was \a147The Three Gables, Harrow Weald.\a148\a147So that\a146s that!\a148 said Holmes. \a147And now, if you can spare the time, Watson, we will get upon our way.\a148A short railway journey, and a shorter drive, brought us to the house, a brick and timber villa, standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland. Three small projections above the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name. Behind was a grove of melancholy, half-grown pines, and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing. None the less, we found the house to be well furnished, and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person, who bore every mark of refinement and culture.\a147I remember your husband well, madam,\a148 said Holmes, \a147though it is some years since he used my services in some trifling matter.\a148\a147Probably you would be more familiar with the name of my son Douglas.\a148Holmes looked at her with great interest.\a147Dear me! Are you the mother of Douglas Maberley? I knew him slightly. But of course all London knew him. What a magnificent creature he was! Where is he now?\a148\a147Dead, Mr. Holmes, dead! He was attach\a200 at Rome, and he died there of pneumonia last month.\a148\a147I am sorry. One could not connect death with such a man. I have never known anyone so vitally alive. He lived intensely\a151 every fibre of him!\a148\a147Too intensely, Mr. Holmes. That was the ruin of him. You remember him as he was\a151 debonair and splendid. You did not see the moody, morose, brooding creature into which he developed. His heart was broken. In a single month I seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a worn-out cynical man.\a148\a147A love affair\a151 a woman?\a148\a147Or a fiend. Well, it was not to talk of my poor lad that I asked you to come, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Dr. Watson and I are at your service.\a148\a147There have been some very strange happenings. I have been in this house more than a year now, and as I wished to lead a retired life I have seen little of my neighbours. Three days ago I had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent. He said that this house would exactly suit a client of his, and that if I would part with it money would be no object. It seemed to me very strange as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible, but naturally I was interested in what he said. I therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than I gave. He at once closed with the offer, but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would I put a price upon it. Some of this furniture is from my old home, and it is, as you see, very good, so that I named a good round sum. To this also he at once agreed. I had always wanted to travel, and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that I should be my own mistress for the rest of my life.\a147Yesterday the man arrived with the agreement all drawn out. Luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer, who lives in Harrow. He said to me, \a145This is a very strange document. Are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything out of the house\a151 not even your own private possessions?\a146 When the man came again in the evening I pointed this out, and I said that I meant only to sell the furniture.\a147\a160\a145No, no, everything,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145But my clothes? My jewels?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, well, some concession might be made for your personal effects. But nothing shall go out of the house unchecked. My client is a very liberal man, but he has his fads and his own way of doing things. It is everything or nothing with him.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then it must be nothing,\a146 said I. And there the matter was left, but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that I thought\a151\a148Here we had a very extraordinary interruption.Holmes raised his hand for silence. Then he strode across the room, flung open the door, and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder. She entered with ungainly struggle like some huge awkward chicken, torn, squawking, out of its coop.\a147Leave me alone! What are you a-doin\a146 of?\a148 she screeched.\a147Why, Susan, what is this?\a148\a147Well, ma\a146am, I was comin\a146 in to ask if the visitors was stayin\a146 for lunch when this man jumped out at me.\a148\a147I have been listening to her for the last five minutes, but did not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative. Just a little wheezy, Susan, are you not? You breathe too heavily for that kind of work.\a148Susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor. \a147Who be you, anyhow, and what right have you a-pullin\a146 me about like this?\a148\a147It was merely that I wished to ask a question in your presence. Did you, Mrs. Maberley, mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me?\a148\a147No, Mr. Holmes, I did not.\a148\a147Who posted your letter?\a148\a147Susan did.\a148\a147Exactly. Now, Susan, to whom was it that you wrote or sent a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me?\a148\a147It\a146s a lie. I sent no message.\a148\a147Now, Susan, wheezy people may not live long, you know. It\a146s a wicked thing to tell fibs. Whom did you tell?\a148\a147Susan!\a148 cried her mistress, \a147I believe you are a bad, treacherous woman. I remember now that I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.\a148\a147That was my own business,\a148 said the woman sullenly.\a147Suppose I tell you that it was Barney Stockdale to whom you spoke?\a148 said Holmes.\a147Well, if you know, what do you want to ask for?\a148\a147I was not sure, but I know now. Well now, Susan, it will be worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of Barney.\a148\a147Someone that could lay down a thousand pounds for every ten you have in the world.\a148\a147So, a rich man? No; you smiled\a151 a rich woman. Now we have got so far, you may as well give the name and earn the tenner.\a148\a147I\a146ll see you in hell first.\a148\a147Oh, Susan! Language!\a148\a147I am clearing out of here. I\a146ve had enough of you all. I\a146ll send for my box to-morrow.\a148 She flounced for the door.\a147Good-bye, Susan. Paregoric is the stuff\a148... Now,\a148 he continued, turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman, \a147this gang means business. Look how close they play the game. Your letter to me had the 10 P.M. postmark. And yet Susan passes the word to Barney. Barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions; he or she\a151 I incline to the latter from Susan\a146s grin when she thought I had blundered\a151 forms a plan. Black Steve is called in, and I am warned off by eleven o\a146clock next morning. That\a146s quick work, you know.\a148\a147But what do they want?\a148\a147Yes, that\a146s the question. Who had the house before you?\a148\a147A retired sea captain called Ferguson.\a148\a147Anything remarkable about him?\a148\a147Not that ever I heard of.\a148\a147I was wondering whether he could have buried something. Of course, when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the Post-Office bank. But there are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them. At first I thought of some buried valuable. But why, in that case, should they want your furniture? You don\a146t happen to have a Raphael or a first folio Shakespeare without knowing it?\a148\a147No, I don\a146t think I have anything rarer than a Crown Derby tea-set.\a148\a147That would hardly justify all this mystery. Besides, why should they not openly state what they want? If they covet your tea-set, they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out, lock, stock, and barrel. No, as I read it, there is something which you do not know that you have, and which you would not give up if you did know.\a148\a147That is how I read it,\a148 said I.\a147Dr. Watson agrees, so that settles it.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, what can it be?\a148\a147Let us see whether by this purely mental analysis we can get it to a finer point. You have been in this house a year.\a148\a147Nearly two.\a148\a147All the better. During this long period no one wants anything from you. Now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands. What would you gather from that?\a148\a147It can only mean,\a148 said I, \a147that the object, whatever it may be, has only just come into the house.\a148\a147Settled once again,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, Mrs. Maberley has any object just arrived?\a148\a147No, I have bought nothing new this year.\a148\a147Indeed! That is very remarkable. Well, I think we had best let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data. Is that lawyer of yours a capable man?\a148\a147Mr. Sutro is most capable.\a148\a147Have you another maid, or was the fair Susan, who has just banged your front door alone?\a148\a147I have a young girl.\a148\a147Try and get Sutro to spend a night or two in the house. You might possibly want protection.\a148\a147Against whom?\a148\a147Who knows? The matter is certainly obscure. If I can\a146t find what they are after, I must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal. Did this house-agent man give any address?\a148\a147Simply his card and occupation. Haines-Johnson, Auctioneer and Valuer.\a148\a147I don\a146t think we shall find him in the directory. Honest business men don\a146t conceal their place of business. Well, you will let me know any fresh development. I have taken up your case, and you may rely upon it that I shall see it through.\a148As we passed through the hall Holmes\a146s eyes, which missed nothing, lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in a corner. The labels shone out upon them.\a147\a160\a145Milano.\a146 \a145Lucerne.\a146 These are from Italy.\a148\a147They are poor Douglas\a146s things.\a148\a147You have not unpacked them? How long have you had them?\a148\a147They arrived last week.\a148\a147But you said\a151 why, surely this might be the missing link. How do we know that there is not something of value there?\a148\a147There could not possibly be, Mr. Holmes. Poor Douglas had only his pay and a small annuity. What could he have of value?\a148Holmes was lost in thought.\a147Delay no longer, Mrs. Maberley,\a148 he said at last. \a147Have these things taken upstairs to your bedroom. Examine them as soon as possible and see what they contain. I will come tomorrow and hear your report.\a148It was quite evident that The Three Gables was under very close surveillance, for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prize-fighter standing in the shadow. We came on him quite suddenly, and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place. Holmes clapped his hand to his pocket.\a147Lookin\a146 for your gun, Masser Holmes?\a148\a147No, for my scent-bottle, Steve.\a148\a147You are funny, Masser Holmes, ain\a146t you?\a148\a147It won\a146t be funny for you, Steve, if I get after you. I gave you fair warning this morning.\a148\a147Well, Masser Holmes, I done gone think over what you said, and I don\a146t want no more talk about that affair of Masser Perkins. S\a146pose I can help you, Masser Holmes, I will.\a148\a147Well, then, tell me who is behind you on this job.\a148\a147So help me the Lord! Masser Holmes, I told you the truth before. I don\a146t know. My boss Barney gives me orders and that\a146s all.\a148\a147Well, just bear in mind, Steve, that the lady in that house, and everything under that roof, is under my protection. Don\a146t forget it.\a148\a147All right, Masser Holmes. I\a146ll remember.\a148\a147I\a146ve got him thoroughly frightened for his own skin, Watson,\a148 Holmes remarked as we walked on. \a147I think he would double-cross his employer if he knew who he was. It was lucky I had some knowledge of the Spencer John crowd, and that Steve was one of them. Now, Watson, this is a case for Langdale Pike, and I am going to see him now. When I get back I may be clearer in the matter.\a148I saw no more of Holmes during the day, but I could well imagine how he spent it, for Langdale Pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal. This strange, languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a St. James\a146s Street club and was the receiving-station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the metropolis. He made, it was said, a four-figure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the garbage papers which cater to an inquisitive public. If ever, far down in the turbid depths of London life, there was some strange swirl or eddy, it was marked with automatic exactness by this human dial upon the surface. Holmes discreetly helped Langdale to knowledge, and on occasion was helped in turn.W\then I met my friend in his room early next morning, I was conscious from his bearing that all was well, but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us. It took the shape of the following telegram.\tP\tlease come out at once. Client\a146s house burgled in the night. Police in possession.\tS\tUTRO. \tHolmes whistled. \a147The drama has come to a crisis, and quicker than I had expected. There is a great driving-power at the back of this business, Watson, which does not surprise me after what I have heard. This Sutro, of course, is her lawyer. I made a mistake, I fear, in not asking you to spend the night on guard. This fellow has clearly proved a broken reed. Well, there is nothing for it but another journey to Harrow Weald.\a148We found The Three Gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day. A small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate, while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds. Within we met a gray old gentleman, who introduced himself as the lawyer together with a bustling, rubicund inspector, who greeted Hoimes as an old friend.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, no chance for you in this case, I\a146m afraid. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply.\a148\a147I am sure the case is in very good hands,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Merely a common burglary, you say?\a148\a147Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it\a151 they\a146ve been seen about here.\a148\a147Excellent! What did they get?\a148\a147Well, they don\a146t seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was chloroformed and the house was\a151 Ah! here is the lady herself.\a148Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maidservant.\a147You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said she, smiling ruefully. \a147Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so I was unprotected.\a148\a147I only heard of it this morning,\a148 the lawyer explained.\a147Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I neglected his advice, and I have paid for it.\a148\a147You look wretchedly ill,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Perhaps you are hardly equal to telling me what occurred.\a148\a147It is all here,\a148 said the inspector, tapping a bulky notebook.\a147Still, if the lady is not too exhausted\a151\a148\a147There is really so little to tell. I have no doubt that wicked Susan had planned an entrance for them. They must have known the house to an inch. I was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth, but I have no notion how long I may have been senseless. When I woke, one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my son\a146s baggage, which was partially opened and littered over the floor. Before he could get away I sprang up and seized him.\a148\a147You took a big risk,\a148 said the inspector.\a147I clung to him, but he shook me off, and the other may have struck me, for I can remember no more. Mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window. That brought the police, but the rascals had got away.\a148\a147What did they take?\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t think there is anything of value missing. I am sure there was nothing in my son\a146s trunks.\a148\a147Did the men leave no clue?\a148\a147There was one sheet of paper which I may have torn from the man that I grasped. It was lying all crumpled on the floor. It is in my son\a146s handwriting.\a148\a147Which means that it is not of much use,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Now if it had been in the burglar\a146s\a151\a148\a147Exactly,\a148 said Holmes. \a147What rugged common sense! None the less, I should be curious to see it.\a148The inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocketbook.\a147I never pass anything, however trifling,\a148 said he with some pomposity. \a147That is my advice to you, Mr. Holmes. In twenty-five years\a146 experience I have learned my lesson. There is always the chance of finger-marks or something.\a148Holmes inspected the sheet of paper.\a147What do you make of it, Inspector?\a148\a147Seems to be the end of some queer novel, so far as I can see.\a148\a147It may certainly prove to be the end of a queer tale,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You have noticed the number on the top of the page. It is two hundred and forty-five. Where are the odd two hundred and forty-four pages?\a148\a147Well, I suppose the burglars got those. Much good may it do them!\a148\a147It seems a queer thing to break into a house in order to steal such papers as that. Does it suggest anything to you, Inspector?\a148\a147Yes, sir, it suggests that in their hurry the rascals just grabbed at what came first to hand. I wish them joy of what they got.\a148\a147Why should they go to my son\a146s things?\a148 asked Mrs. Maberley.\a147Well, they found nothing valuable downstairs, so they tried their luck upstairs. That is how I read it. What do you make of it, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147\tI must think it over, Inspector. Come to the window, Watson.\a148 Then, as we stood together, he read over the fragment of paper. It began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this:\t\a147\t.\a160.\a160.\a160face bled considerably from the cuts and blows, but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face, the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life, looking out at his agony and humiliation. She smiled\a151 yes, by Heaven! she smiled, like the heartless fiend she was, as he looked up at her. It was at that moment that love died and hate was born. Man must live for something. If it is not for your embrace, my lady, then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge.\a148 \t\a147Queer grammar!\a148 said Holmes with a smile as he handed the paper back to the inspector. \a147Did you notice how the \a145he\a146 suddenly changed to \a145my\a146? The writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero.\a148\a147It seemed mighty poor stuff,\a148 said the inspector as he replaced it in his book. \a147What! are you off, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I don\a146t think there is anything more for me to do now that the case is in such capable hands. By the way, Mrs. Maberley, did you say you wished to travel?\a148\a147It has always been my dream, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Where would you like to go\a151 Cairo, Madeira, the Riviera?\a148\a147Oh if I had the money I would go round the world.\a148\a147Quite so. Round the world. Well, good-morning. I may drop you a line in the evening.\a148 As we passed the window I caught a glimpse of the inspector\a146s smile and shake of the head. \a147These clever fellows have always a touch of madness.\a148 That was what I read in the inspector\a146s smile.\a147Now, Watson, we are at the last lap of our little journey,\a148 said Holmes when we were back in the roar of central London once more. \a147I think we had best clear the matter up at once, and it would be well that you should come with me, for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as Isadora Klein.\a148We had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in Grosvenor Square. Holmes had been sunk in thought, but he roused himself suddenly.\a147By the way, Watson, I suppose you see it all clearly?\a148\a147No, I can\a146t say that I do. I only gather that we are going to see the lady who is behind all this mischief.\a148\a147Exactly! But does the name Isadora Klein convey nothing to you? She was, of course, \ithe\i celebrated beauty. There was never a woman to touch her. She is pure Spanish, the real blood of the masterful Conquistadors, and her people have been leaders in Pernambuco for generations. She married the aged German sugar king, Klein, and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth. Then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes. She had several lovers, and Douglas Maberley, one of the most striking men in London, was one of them. It was by all accounts more than an adventure with him. He was not a society butterfly but a strong, proud man who gave and expected all. But she is the \i\a145belle dame sans merci\a146\i of fiction. When her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended, and if the other party in the matter can\a146t take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him.\a148\a147Then that was his own story\a151\a148\a147Ah! you are piecing it together now. I hear that she is about to marry the young Duke of Lomond, who might almost be her son. His Grace\a146s ma might overlook the age, but a big scandal would be a different matter, so it is imperative\a151 Ah! here we are.\a148It was one of the finest corner-houses of the West End. A machine-like footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home. \a147Then we shall wait until she is,\a148 said Holmes cheerfully.The machine broke down.\a147Not at home means not at home to you,\a148 said the footman.\a147Good,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147That means that we shall not have to wait. Kindly give this note to your mistress.\a148He scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook, folded it, and handed it to the man.\a147What did you say, Holmes?\a148 I asked.\a147I simply wrote: \a145Shall it be the police, then?\a146 I think that should pass us in.\a148It did\a151 with amazing celerity. A minute later we were in an Arabian Nights drawing-room, vast and wonderful, in a half gloom, picked out with an occasional pink electric light. The lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half light more welcome. She rose from a settee as we entered: tall, queenly, a perfect figure, a lovely mask-like face, with two wonderful Spanish eyes which looked murder at us both.\a147What is this intrusion\a151 and this insulting message?\a148 she asked, holding up the slip of paper.\a147I need not explain, madame. I have too much respect for your intelligence to do so\a151 though I confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late.\a148\a147How so, sir?\a148\a147By supposing that your hired bullies could frighten me from my work. Surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him. It was you, then, who forced me to examine the case of young Maberley.\a148\a147I have no idea what you are talking about. What have I to do with hired bullies?\a148Holmes turned away wearily.\a147Yes, I have underrated your intelligence. Well, good-afternoon!\a148\a147Stop! Where are you going?\a148\a147To Scotland Yard.\a148We had not got halfway to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm. She had turned in a moment from steel to velvet.\a147Come and sit down, gentlemen. Let us talk this matter over. I feel that I may be frank with you, Mr. Holmes. You have the feelings of a gentleman. How quick a woman\a146s instinct is to find it out. I will treat you as a friend.\a148\a147I cannot promise to reciprocate, madame. I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go. I am ready to listen, and then I will tell you how I will act.\a148\a147No doubt it was foolish of me to threaten a brave man like yourself.\a148\a147What was really foolish, madame, is that you have placed yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away.\a148\a147No, no! I am not so simple. Since I have promised to be frank, I may say that no one, save Barney Stockdale and Susan, his wife, have the least idea who their employer is. As to them, well, it is not the first\a151\a148 She smiled and nodded with a charming coquettish intimacy.\a147I see. You\a146ve tested them before.\a148\a147They are good hounds who run silent.\a148\a147Such hounds have a way sooner or later of biting the hand that feeds them. They will be arrested for this burglary. The police are already after them.\a148\a147They will take what comes to them. That is what they are paid for. I shall not appear in the matter.\a148\a147Unless I bring you into it.\a148\a147No, no, you would not. You are a gentleman. It is a woman\a146s secret.\a148\a147In the first place, you must give back this manuscript.\a148She broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace. There was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker. \a147Shall I give this back?\a148 she asked. So roguish and exquisite did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that I felt of all Holmes\a146s criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face. However, he was immune from sentiment.\a147That seals your fate,\a148 he said coldly. \a147You are very prompt in your actions, madame, but you have overdone it on this occasion.\a148She threw the poker down with a clatter.\a147How hard you are!\a148 she cried. \a147May I tell you the whole story?\a148\a147I fancy I could tell it to you.\a148\a147But you must look at it with my eyes, Mr. Holmes. You must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her life\a146s ambition about to be ruined at the last moment. Is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself?\a148\a147The original sin was yours.\a148\a147Yes, yes! I admit it. He was a dear boy, Douglas, but it so chanced that he could not fit into my plans. He wanted marriage\a151 marriage, Mr. Holmes\a151 with a penniless commoner. Nothing less would serve him. Then he became pertinacious. Because I had given he seemed to think that I still must give, and to him only. It was intolerable. At last I had to make him realize it.\a148\a147By hiring ruffians to beat him under your own window.\a148\a147You do indeed seem to know everything. Well, it is true. Barney and the boys drove him away, and were, I admit, a little rough in doing so. But what did he do then? Could I have believed that a gentleman would do such an act? He wrote a book in which he described his own story. I, of course, was the wolf; he the lamb. It was all there, under different names, of course; but who in all London would have failed to recognize it? What do you say to that, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, he was within his rights.\a148\a147It was as if the air of Italy had got into his blood and brought with it the old cruel Italian spirit. He wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that I might have the torture of anticipation. There were two copies, he said\a151 one for me, one for his publisher.\a148\a147How did you know the publisher\a146s had not reached him?\a148\a147I knew who his publisher was. It is not his only novel, you know. I found out that he had not heard from Italy. Then came Douglas\a146s sudden death. So long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me. Of course, it must be among his effects, and these would be returned to his mother. I set the gang at work. One of them got into the house as servant. I wanted to do the thing honestly. I really and truly did. I was ready to buy the house and everything in it. I offered any price she cared to ask. I only tried the other way when everything else had failed. Now, Mr. Holmes, granting that I was too hard on Douglas\a151 and, God knows, I am sorry for it!what else could I do with my whole future at stake?\a148Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\a147Well, well,\a148 said he, \a147I suppose I shall have to compound a felony as usual. How much does it cost to go round the world in first-class style?\a148The lady stared in amazement.\a147Could it be done on five thousand pounds?\a148\a147Well, I should think so, indeed!\a148\a147Very good. I think you will sign me a cheque for that, and I will see that it comes to Mrs. Maberley. You owe her a little change of air. Meantime, lady\a148he wagged a cautionary forefinger\a147have a care! Have a care! You can\a146t play with edged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands.\a148\p\X1\BThe Blanched Soldier\B\X1\c\i\m="blan-03.png"\i\cThe ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. \a147Try it yourself, Holmes!\a148 he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate.I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone.It is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.\a147From South Africa, sir, I perceive.\a148\a147Yes, sir,\a148 he answered, with some surprise.\a147Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.\a148\a147Exactly.\a148\a147Middlesex Corps, no doubt.\a148\a147That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.\a148I smiled at his bewildered expression.\a147When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?\a148\a147You see everything.\a148\a147I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?\a148\a147Mr. Holmes\a151!\a148\a147My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.\a148\a147Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out\a151\a148\a147Kicked you out!\a148\a147Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn\a146t have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey\a146s sake.\a148I lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.\a147Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.\a148My client grinned mischievously.\a147I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,\a148 said he. \a147But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I\a146ve been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become.\a147When I joined up in January, 1901just two years ago\a151 young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth\a146s only son\a151 Emsworth the Crimean V. C.and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship\a151 the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate\a151 and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside-Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a word\a151 not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.\a147Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all.\a147I wasn\a146t satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn\a146t satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years\a146 absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey\a146s case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.\a148Mr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.\a147Well, what have you done?\a148 I asked.\a147My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore\a151 I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father\a151 and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday.\a147Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible\a151 five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey\a146s nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also\a151 a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred.\a147We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling grey beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture\a146s beak, and two fierce grey eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.\a147\a160\a145Well, sir,\a146 said he in a rasping voice, \a145I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.\a146\a147I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.\a147\a160\a145Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.\a146\a147\a160\a145I have his letters to me in my pocket.\a146\a147\a160\a145Kindly let me see them.\a146\a147He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.\a147\a160\a145Well, what then?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly,\a146 I answered. \a145But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.\a146\a147My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it.\a147\a160\a145Many people, Mr. Dodd,\a146 said he, \a145would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.\a146\a147\a160\a145You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.\a146\a147\a160\a145Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey\a146s past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.\a146\a147So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend\a146s fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one\a146s quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.\a147\a160\a145I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.\a146\a147He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.\a147\a160\a145Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It\a146s natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?\a146\a147\a160\a145There was no braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.\a146\a147The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There\a146s not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy\a151 and oh, sir, he was a fine man.\a146\a147I sprang to my feet.\a147\a160\a145Look here!\a146 I cried. \a145You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?\a146\a147I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.\a147\a160\a145I don\a146t know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.\a146\a147He was leaving the room, but I held his arm\a147\a160\a145Listen,\a146 I said. \a145You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?\a148\a147He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotised The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.\a147\a160\a145I wish to God he was!\a146 he cried, and, tearing himself free he dashed from the room.\a147You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man\a146s words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.\a148My client had paused as one in deep emotion.\a147Pray continue,\a148 I said. \a147Your problem presents some very unusual features.\a148\a147He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale\a151 never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness.\a147There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn\a146t merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that\a151 something slinking, something furtive, something guilty\a151 something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind.\a147But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken.\a147It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain.\a147There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.\a147The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.\a147There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size\a151 large enough for a gardener\a146s or a gamekeeper\a146s residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat\a151 not at all the gardener type\a151 came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face.\a147\a160\a145Are you a visitor here?\a146 he asked.\a147I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey\a146s.\a147\a160\a145What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,\a146 I continued.\a147\a160\a145Quite so. Exactly,\a146 said he with a rather guilty air. \a145No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.\a146 He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.\a147I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.\a147I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.\a148\a147What paper?\a148 I asked.My client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.\a147Can it matter?\a148 he asked.\a147It is most essential.\a148\a147I really took no notice.\a148\a147Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.\a148\a147Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the Spectator. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.\a147\a160\a145This way, sir!\a146 said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-table in the hall.\a147 There is a train to London at 8:30,\a146 said he. \a145The trap will be at the door at eight.\a146\a147He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.\a147\a160\a145The matter will not bear discussion,\a146 said he abruptly. \a145You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.\a146\a147At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.\a147\a160\a145I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.\a146\a147The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.\a148Such was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions.\a147The servants,\a148 I asked; \a147how many were in the house?\a148\a147To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.\a148\a147There was no servant, then, in the detached house?\a148\a147None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.\a148\a147That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?\a148\a147Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.\a148\a147Did you make any local inquiries?\a148\a147Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.\a148\a147You said nothing of your suspicions?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.\a148\a147To-day?\a148It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-grey aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements.\a147This is an old friend,\a148 said I to Dodd. \a147It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.\a148The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear.\a147You say that you saw your friend\a146s face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?\a148\a147I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.\a148\a147It could not have been someone resembling him?\a148\a147No, no, it was he.\a148\a147But you say he was changed?\a148\a147Only in colour. His face was\a151 how shall I describe it?it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.\a148\a147Was it equally pale all over?\a148\a147I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.\a148\a147Did you call to him?\a148\a147I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.\a148My case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales.Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph\a146s message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments.\a147Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I\a146ll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,\a148 turning upon me, \a147I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.\a148\a147I cannot leave here,\a148 said my client firmly, \a147until I hear from Godfrey\a146s own lips that he is under no restraint.\a148Our involuntary host rang the bell.\a147Ralph,\a148 he said, \a147telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 said I. \a147You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognise that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.\a148\a147I am not so easily altered,\a148 said the old soldier. \a147Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!\a148\a147Nothing of the sort,\a148 I said, putting my back to the door. \a147Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.\a148 I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. \a147That,\a148 said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, \a147is what has brought us here.\a148He stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished.\a147How do you know?\a148 he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.\a147It is my business to know things. That is my trade.\a148He sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation.\a147Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.\a148At the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face.\a147This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,\a148 said he. \a147This will disarrange all our plans.\a148\a147I can\a146t help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?\a148\a147Yes, he is waiting inside.\a148 He turned and led us into a large plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand.\a147Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!\a148But the other waved him back.\a147Don\a146t touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don\a146t quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?\a148His appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.\a147That\a146s why I don\a146t court visitors,\a148 said he. \a147I don\a146t mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.\a148\a147I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.\a148\a147Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn\a146t help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.\a148\a147But what in heaven\a146s name is the matter?\a148\a147Well, it\a146s not a long story to tell,\a148 said he, lighting a cigarette. \a147You remember that morning fight at Buffelsspruit, outside Pretoria, on the Eastern railway line? You heard I was hit?\a148\a147Yes, I heard that but I never got particulars.\a148\a147Three of us got separated from the others. It was very broken country, you may remember. There was Simpson\a151 the fellow we called Baldy Simpson\a151 and Anderson, and I. We were clearing brother Boer, but he lay low and got the three of us. The other two were killed. I got an elephant bullet through my shoulder. I stuck on to my horse, however, and he galloped several miles before I fainted and rolled off the saddle.\a147When I came to myself it was nightfall, and I raised myself up, feeling very weak and ill. To my surprise there was a house close beside me, a fairly large house with a broad stoep and many windows. It was deadly cold. You remember the kind of numb cold which used to come at evening, a deadly, sickening sort of cold, very different from a crisp healthy frost. Well, I was chilled to the bone, and my only hope seemed to lie in reaching that house. I staggered to my feet and dragged myself along, hardly conscious of what I did. I have a dim memory of slowly ascending the steps, entering a wide-opened door, passing into a large room which contained several beds, and throwing myself down with a gasp of satisfaction upon one of them. It was unmade, but that troubled me not at all. I drew the clothes over my shivering body and in a moment I was in a deep sleep.\a147It was morning when I wakened, and it seemed to me that instead of coming out into a world of sanity I had emerged into some extraordinary nightmare. The African sun flooded through the big, curtainless windows, and every detail of the great, bare, whitewashed dormitory stood out hard and clear. In front of me was standing a small, dwarf-like man with a huge, bulbous head, who was jabbering excitedly in Dutch, waving two horrible hands which looked to me like brown sponges. Behind him stood a group of people who seemed to be intensely amused by the situation, but a chill came over me as I looked at them. Not one of them was a normal human being. Every one was twisted or swollen or disfigured in some strange way. The laughter of these strange monstrosities was a dreadful thing to hear.\a147It seemed that none of them could speak English, but the situation wanted clearing up, for the creature with the big head was growing furiously angry, and, uttering wild-beast cries, he had laid his deformed hands upon me and was dragging me out of bed, regardless of the fresh flow of blood from my wound. The little monster was as strong as a bull, and I don\a146t know what he might have done to me had not an elderly man who was clearly in authority been attracted to the room by the hubbub; He said a few stern words in Dutch, and my persecutor shrank away. Then he turned upon me, gazing at me in the utmost amazement.\a147\a160\a145How in the world did you come here?\a146 he asked in amazement. \a145Wait a bit! I see that you are tired out and that wounded shoulder of yours wants looking after. I am a doctor, and I\a146ll soon have you tied up. But, man alive! you are in far greater danger here than ever you were on the battlefield. You are in the Leper Hospital, and you have slept in a leper\a146s bed.\a146\a147Need I tell you more, Jimmie? It seems that in view of the approaching battle all these poor creatures had been evacuated the day before. Then, as the British advanced, they had been brought back by this, their medical superintendent, who assured me that, though he believed he was immune to the disease, he would none the less never have dared to do what I had done. He put me in a private room, treated me kindly, and within a week or so I was removed to the general hospital at Pretoria.\a147So there you have my tragedy. I hoped against hope, but it was not until I had reached home that the terrible signs which you see upon my face told me that I had not escaped. What was I to do? I was in this lonely house. We had two servants whom we could utterly trust. There was a house where I could live. Under pledge of secrecy, Mr. Kent, who is a surgeon, was prepared to stay with me. It seemed simple enough on those lines. The alternative was a dreadful one\a151 segregation for life among strangers with never a hope of release. But absolute secrecy was necessary, or even in this quiet countryside there would have been an outcry, and I should have been dragged to my horrible doom. Even you, Jimmie\a151 even you had to be kept in the dark. Why my father has relented I cannot imagine.\a148Colonel Emsworth pointed to me.\a147This is the gentleman who forced my hand.\a148 He unfolded the scrap of paper on which I had written the word \a147Leprosy.\a148 \a147It seemed to me that if he knew so much as that it was safer that he should know all.\a148\a147And so it was,\a148 said I. \a147Who knows but good may come of it? I understand that only Mr. Kent has seen the patient. May I ask, sir, if you are an authority on such complaints, which are, I understand, tropical or semi-tropical in their nature?\a148\a147I have the ordinary knowledge of the educated medical man,\a148 he observed with some stiffness.\a147I have no doubt, sir, that you are fully competent, but I am sure that you will agree that in such a case a second opinion is valuable. You have avoided this, I understand, for fear that pressure should be put upon you to segregate the patient.\a148\a147That is so,\a148 said Colonel Emsworth.\a147I foresaw this situation,\a148 I explained, \a147and I have brought with me a friend whose discretion may absolutely be trusted. I was able once to do him a professional service, and he is ready to advise as a friend rather than as a specialist. His name is Sir James Saunders.\a148The prospect of an interview with Lord Roberts would not have excited greater wonder and pleasure in a raw subaltern than was now reflected upon the face of Mr. Kent.\a147I shall indeed be proud,\a148 he murmured.\a147Then I will ask Sir James to step this way. He is at present in the carriage outside the door. Meanwhile, Colonel Emsworth, we may perhaps assemble in your study, where I could give the necessary explanations.\a148And here it is that I miss my Watson. By cunning questions and ejaculations of wonder he could elevate my simple art, which is but systematised common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey\a146s mother in the study of Colonel Emsworth.\a147That process,\a148 said I, \a147starts upon the supposition that when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. It may well be that several explanations remain, in which case one tries test after test until one or other of them has a convincing amount of support. We will now apply this principle to the case in point. As it was first presented to me, there were three possible explanations of the seclusion or incarceration of this gentleman in an outhouse of his father\a146s mansion. There was the explanation that he was in hiding for a crime, or that he was mad and that they wished to avoid an asylum, or that he had some disease which caused his segregation. I could think of no other adequate solutions. These, then, had to be sifted and balanced against each other.\a147The criminal solution would not bear inspection. No unsolved crime had been reported from that district. I was sure of that. If it were some crime not yet discovered, then clearly it would be to the interest of the family to get rid of the delinquent and send him abroad rather than keep him concealed at home. I could see no explanation for such a line of conduct.\a147Insanity was more plausible. The presence of the second person in the outhouse suggested a keeper. The fact that he locked the door when he came out strengthened the supposition and gave the idea of constraint. On the other hand, this constraint could not be severe or the young man could not have got loose and come down to have a look at his friend. You will remember, Mr. Dodd, that I felt round for points, asking you, for example, about the paper which Mr. Kent was reading. Had it been the Lancet or the British Medical Journal it would have helped me. It is not illegal, however, to keep a lunatic upon private premises so long as there is a qualified person in attendance and that the authorities have been duly notified. Why, then, all this desperate desire for secrecy? Once again I could not get the theory to fit the facts.\a147There remained the third possibility, into which, rare and unlikely as it was, everything seemed to fit. Leprosy is not uncommon in South Africa. By some extraordinary chance this youth might have contracted it. His people would be placed in a very dreadful position, since they would desire to save him from segregation. Great secrecy would be needed to prevent rumours from getting about and subsequent interference by the authorities. A devoted medical man, if sufficiently paid, would easily be found to take charge of the sufferer. There would be no reason why the latter should not be allowed freedom after dark. Bleaching of the skin is a common result of the disease. The case was a strong one\a151 so strong that I determined to act as if it were actually proved. When on arriving here I noticed that Ralph, who carries out the meals, had gloves which are impregnated with disinfectants, my last doubts were removed. A single word showed you, sir, that your secret was discovered, and if I wrote rather than said it, it was to prove to you that my discretion was to be trusted.\a148I was finishing this little analysis of the case when the door was opened and the austere figure of the great dermatologist was ushered in. But for once his sphinx-like features had relaxed and there was a warm humanity in his eyes. He strode up to Colonel Emsworth and shook him by the hand.\a147It is often my lot to bring ill-tidings and seldom good,\a148 said he. \a147This occasion is the more welcome. It is not leprosy.\a148\a147What?\a148\a147A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scalelike affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable, and certainly noninfective. Yes, Mr. Holmes, the coincidence is a remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional reputation\a151 But the lady has fainted! I think that Mr. Kent had better be with her until she recovers from this joyous shock.\a148\p\X1\BThe Lion\a146s Mane\B\X1\c\i\m="lion-01.png"\i\cIt is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as abstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional career should have come to me after my retirement, and be brought, as it were, to my very door. It occurred after my withdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life of Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of London. At this period of my life the good Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end visit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I must act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every difficulty! As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which lay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion\a146s Mane.My villa is situated upon the southern slope of the downs, commanding a great view of the Channel. At this point the coast-line is entirely of chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous path, which is steep and slippery. At the bottom of the path lie a hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full. Here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make splendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow. This admirable beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point where the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line.My house is lonely. I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate all to ourselves. Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst\a146s well-known coaching establishment, The Gables, quite a large place, which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various professions, with a staff of several masters. Stackhurst himself was a well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar. He and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on each other in the evenings without an invitation.Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind blowing up-channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs and leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide. On the morning of which I speak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh. It was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked along the cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. As I walked I heard a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in cheery greeting.\a147What a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I should see you out.\a148\a147Going for a swim, I see.\a148\a147At your old tricks again,\a148 he laughed, patting his bulging pocket. \a147Yes. McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.\a148Fitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following rheumatic fever. He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him. Summer and winter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have often joined him.At this moment we saw the man himself. His head showed above the edge of the cliff where the path ends. Then his whole figure appeared at the top, staggering like a drunken man. The next instant he threw up his hands and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face. Stackhurst and I rushed forward\a151 it may have been fifty yards\a151 and turned him on his back. He was obviously dying. Those glazed sunken eyes and dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else. One glimmer of life came into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words with an eager air of warning. They were slurred and indistinct, but to my ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were \a147the Lion\a146s Mane.\a148 It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and yet I could twist the sound into no other sense. Then he half raised himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air, and fell forward on his side. He was dead.My companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may well be imagined, had every sense on the alert. And I had need, for it was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary case. The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers, and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes. As he fell over, his Burberry, which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing his trunk. We stared at it in amazement. His back was covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire scourge. The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his shoulders and ribs. There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony. His drawn and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been.I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell across us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side. Murdoch was the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend. He seemed to live in some high abstract region of surds and conic sections, with little to connect him with ordinary life. He was looked upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but there was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face but also in occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as ferocious. On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to McPherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the plate-glass window, an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher. Such was the strange complex man who now appeared beside us. He seemed to be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and himself.\a147Poor fellow! Poor fellow! What can I do? How can I help?\a148\a147Were you with him? Can you tell us what has happened?\a148\a147No, no, I was late this morning. I was not on the beach at all. I have come straight from The Gables. What can I do?\a148\a147You can hurry to the police-station at Fulworth. Report the matter at once.\a148Without a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the matter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by the body. My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach. From the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen far away moving towards the village of Fulworth. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path. There was clay or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the same footstep, both ascending and descending. No one else had gone down to the beach by this track that morning. At one place I observed the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline. This could only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended. There were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down upon his knees more than once. At the bottom of the path was the considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide. At the side of it McPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock. It was folded and dry, so that it would seem that, after all, he had never entered the water. Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard shingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen. The latter fact proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated that he had not actually done so.And here was the problem clearly defined\a151 as strange a one as had ever confronted me. The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter of an hour at the most. Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables, so there could be no doubt about that. He had gone to bathe and had stripped, as the naked footsteps showed. Then he had suddenly huddled on his clothes again\a151 they were all dishevelled and unfastened\a151 and he had returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself. And the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been scourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl away and to die. Who had done this barbarous deed? There were, it is true, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment. Then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach. They seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the broad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him and them, lapping up to the rocks. On the sea two or three fishing boats were at no great distance. Their occupants might be examined at our leisure. There were several roads for inquiry, but none which led to any very obvious goal.When I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of wondering folk had gathered round it. Stackhurst was, of course, still there, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid Sussex breed\a151 a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent exterior. He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and finally drew me aside.\a147I\a146d be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes. This is a big thing for me to handle, and I\a146ll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong.\a148I\t advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor; also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as possible to be made, until they came. In the meantime I searched the dead man\a146s pockets. There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a small folding card-case. From this projected a slip of paper, which I unfolded and handed to the constable. There was written on it in a scrawling, feminine hand:\tI\t will be there, you may be sure.\tM\tAUDIE.\tIt read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were a blank. The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it with the other things to the pockets of the Burberry. Then, as nothing more suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly searched.Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had been removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held. He brought with him some serious and definite news. As I expected, nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had examined the papers in McPherson\a146s desk and there were several which showed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of Fulworth. We had then established the identity of the writer of the note.\a147The police have the letters,\a148 he explained. \a147I could not bring them. But there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair. I see no reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save, indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.\a148\a147But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of using,\a148 I remarked.\a147It is mere chance,\a148 said he, \a147that several of the students were not with McPherson.\a148\a147Was it mere chance?\a148Stackhurst knit his brows in thought.\a147Ian Murdoch held them back,\a148 said he. \a147He would insist upon some algebraic demonstration before breakfast. Poor chap, he is dreadfully cut up about it all.\a148\a147And yet I gather that they were not friends.\a148\a147At one time they were not. But for a year or more Murdoch has been as near to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone. He is not of a very sympathetic disposition by nature.\a148\a147So I understand. I seem to remember your telling me once about a quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.\a148\a147That blew over all right.\a148\a147But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.\a148\a147No, no, I am sure they were real friends.\a148\a147Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. Do you know her?\a148\a147Everyone knows her. She is the beauty of the neighbourhood\a151 a real beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. I knew that McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so far as these letters would seem to indicate.\a148\a147But who is she?\a148\a147She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy who owns all the boats and bathing-cots at Fulworth. He was a fisherman to start with, but is now a man of some substance. He and his son William run the business.\a148\a147Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?\a148\a147On what pretext?\a148\a147Oh, we can easily find a pretext. After all, this poor man did not ill-use himself in this outrageous way. Some human hand was on the handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the injuries. His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely limited. Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.\a148It would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented downs had our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed. The village of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the bay. Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been built upon the rising ground. It was to one of these that Stackhurst guided me.\a147That\a146s The Haven, as Bellamy called it. The one with the corner tower and slate roof. Not bad for a man who started with nothing but\a151 By Jove, look at that!\a148The garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged. There was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure. It was Ian Murdoch, the mathematician. A moment later we confronted him upon the road.\a147Hullo!\a148 said Stackhurst. The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance from his curious dark eyes, and would have-passed us, but his principal pulled him up.\a147What were you doing there?\a148 he asked.Murdoch\a146s face flushed with anger. \a147I am your subordinate, sir, under your roof. I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private actions.\a148Stackhurst\a146s nerves were near the surface after all he had endured. Otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited. Now he lost his temper completely.\a147In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr. Murdoch.\a148\a147Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.\a148\a147This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your insubordinate ways. It will certainly be the last. You will kindly make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.\a148\a147I had intended to do so. I have lost to-day the only person who made The Gables habitable.\a148He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood glaring after him. \a147Is he not an impossible, intolerable man?\a148 he cried.The one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr. Ian Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from the scene of the crime. Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now beginning to take outline in my mind. Perhaps the visit to the Bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter. Stackhurst pulled himself together, and we went forward to the house.Mr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard. He seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid as his hair.\a147No, sir, I do not desire any particulars. My son here\a148indicating a powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the sitting-room\a147is of one mind with me that Mr. McPherson\a146s attentions to Maud were insulting. Yes, sir, the word \a145marriage\a146 was never mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal more of which neither of us could approve. She has no mother, and we are her only guardians. We are determined\a151\a148But the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady herself. There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any assembly in the world. Who could have imagined that so rare a flower would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere? Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the downlands in her delicate colouring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed. Such was the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and intense, in front of Harold Stackhurst.\a147I know already that Fitzroy is dead,\a148 she said. \a147Do not be afraid to tell me the particulars.\a148\a147This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,\a148 explained the father.\a147There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,\a148 growled the younger man.The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon him. \a147This is my business, William. Kindly leave me to manage it in my own way. By all accounts there has been a crime committed. If I can help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is gone.\a148She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as a most complete and remarkable woman. It seems that she already knew me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.\a147Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes. You have my sympathy and my help, whoever they may be.\a148 It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at her father and brother as she spoke.\a147Thank you,\a148 said I. \a147I value a woman\a146s instinct in such matters. You use the word \a145they.\a146 You think that more than one was concerned?\a148\a147I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a strong man. No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage upon him.\a148\a147Might I have one word with you alone?\a148\a147I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,\a148 cried her father angrily.She looked at me helplessly. \a147What can I do?\a148\a147The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm if I discuss them here,\a148 said I. \a147I should have preferred privacy, but if your father will not allow it he must share the deliberations.\a148 Then I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man\a146s pocket. \a147It is sure to be produced at the inquest. May I ask you to throw any light upon it that you can?\a148\a147I see no reason for mystery,\a148 she answered. \a147We were engaged to be married, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy\a146s uncle, who is very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had married against his wish. There was no other reason.\a148\a147You could have told us,\a148 growled Mr. Bellamy.\a147So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.\a148\a147I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.\a148\a147\tIt was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you. As to this appointment\a148she fumbled in her dress and produced a crumpled note\a147it was in answer to this.\a148\tD\tEAREST [ran the message]:\tT\the old place on the beach just after sunset on Tuesday. It is the only time I can get away.\tF\t.M. \t\a147Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him to-night.\a148I turned over the paper. \a147This never came by post. How did you get it?\a148\a147I would rather not answer that question. It has really nothing to do with the matter which you are investigating. But anything which bears upon that I will most freely answer.\a148She was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in our investigation. She had no reason to think that her fianc\a233 had any hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers.\a147May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of them?\a148She blushed and seemed confused.\a147There was a time when I thought he was. But that was all changed when he understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.\a148Again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more definite shape. His record must be examined. His rooms must be privately searched. Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his mind also suspicions were forming. We returned from our visit to The Haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already in our hands.A week passed. The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had been adjourned for further evidence. Stackhurst had made discreet inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search of his room, but without result. Personally, I had gone over the whole ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new conclusions. In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which brought me so completely to the limit of my powers. Even my imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery. And then there came the incident of the dog.It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange wireless by which such people collect the news of the countryside.\a147Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson\a146s dog,\a148 said she one evening.I do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my attention.\a147What of Mr. McPherson\a146s dog?\a148\a147Dead, sir. Died of grief for its master.\a148\a147Who told you this?\a148\a147Why, sir, everyone is talking of it. It took on terrible, and has eaten nothing for a week. Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from The Gables found it dead\a151 down on the beach, sir, at the very place where its master met his end.\a148\a147At the very place.\a148 The words stood out clear in my memory. Some dim perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind. That the dog should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs. But \a147in the very place\a148! Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it? Was it possible that it also had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud? Was it possible\a151? Yes, the perception was dim, but already something was building up in my mind. In a few minutes I was on my way to The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study. At my request he sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog.\a147Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,\a148 said one of them. \a147It must have followed the trail of its dead master.\a148I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon the mat in the hall. The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes projecting, and the limbs contorted. There was agony in every line of it.From The Gables I walked down to the bathing-pool. The sun had sunk and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which glimmered dully like a sheet of lead. The place was deserted and there was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming overhead. In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog\a146s spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master\a146s towel had been laid. For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the shadows grew darker around me. My mind was filled with racing thoughts. You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and which you know is there, though it remains forever just beyond your reach. That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place of death. Then at last I turned and walked slowly homeward.I had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. Like a flash, I remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped. You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge without scientific system, but very available for the needs of my work. My mind is like a crowded box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away therein\a151 so many that I may well have but a vague perception of what was there. I had known that there was something which might bear upon this matter. It was still vague, but at least I knew how I could make it clear. It was monstrous, incredible, and yet it was always a possibility. I would test it to the full.There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed with books. It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for an hour. At the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver volume. Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim remembrance. Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely proposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it might, indeed, be so. It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly awaiting the work of the morrow.But that work met with an annoying interruption. I had hardly swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when_ I had a call from Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabulary\a151 a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a very troubled expression.\a147I know your immense experience, sir,\a148 said he. \a147This is quite unofficial, of course, and need go no farther. But I am fairly up against it in this McPherson case. The question is, shall I make an arrest, or shall I not?\a148\a147Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?\a148\a147Yes, sir. There is really no one else when you come to think of it. That\a146s the advantage of this solitude. We narrow it down to a very small compass. If he did not do it, then who did?\a148\a147What have you against him?\a148He had gleaned along the same furrows as I had. There was Murdoch\a146s character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man. His furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog. The fact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to Miss Bellamy. He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that Murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure.\a147What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this evidence against him?\a148 The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled in his mind.\a147Consider,\a148 I said, \a147all the essential gaps in your case. On the morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi. He had been with his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of McPherson\a146s appearance he came upon us from behind. Then bear in mind the absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself. Finally, there is this question of the instrument with which these injuries were inflicted.\a148\a147What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?\a148\a147Have you examined the marks?\a148 I asked.\a147I have seen them. So has the doctor.\a148\a147But I have examined them very carefully with a lens. They have peculiarities.\a148\a147What are they, Mr. Holmes?\a148I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. \a147This is my method in such cases,\a148 I explained.\a147You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147I should hardly be what I am if I did not. Now let us consider this weal which extends round the right shoulder. Do you observe nothing remarkable?\a148\a147I can\a146t say I do.\a148\a147Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity. There is a dot of extravasated blood here, and another there. There are similar indications in this other weal down here. What can that mean?\a148\a147I have no idea. Have you?\a148\a147Perhaps I have. Perhaps I haven\a146t. I may be able to say more soon. Anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way towards the criminal.\a148\a147It is, of course, an absurd idea,\a148 said the policeman, \a147but if a red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these better marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other.\a148\a147A most ingenious comparison. Or shall we say a very stiff cat-o\a146-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?\a148\a147By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.\a148\a147Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardle. But your case is far too weak for an arrest. Besides, we have those last words\a151 the \a145Lion\a146s Mane.\a146\a160\a148\a147I have wondered whether Ian\a151\a148\a147Yes, I have considered that. If the second word had borne any resemblance to Murdoch\a151 but it did not. He gave it almost in a shriek. I am sure that it was \a145Mane.\a146\a160\a148\a147Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Perhaps I have. But I do not care to discuss it until there is something more solid to discuss.\a148\a147And when will that be?\a148\a147In an hour\a151 possibly less.\a148The inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes.\a147I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps it\a146s those fishing-boats.\a148\a147No, no, they were too far out.\a148\a147Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his? They were not too sweet upon Mr. McPherson. Could they have done him a mischief?\a148\a147No, no, you won\a146t draw me until I am ready,\a148 said I with a smile. \a147Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do. Perhaps if you were to meet me here at midday\a151\a148So far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was the beginning of the end.My outer door was flung open, there were blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect. \a147Brandy! Brandy!\a148 he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa.He was not alone. Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting, almost as distrait as his companion.\a147Yes, yes, brandy!\a148 he cried. \a147The man is at his last gasp. It was all I could do to bring him here. He fainted twice upon the way.\a148Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change. He pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from his shoulders. \a147For God\a146s sake oil, opium, morphia!\a148 he cried. \a147Anything to ease this infernal agony!\a148The inspector and I cried out at the sight. There, crisscrossed upon the man\a146s naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy McPherson.The pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the sufferer\a146s breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black, and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his brow dropped beads of sweat. At any moment he might die. More and more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him back to life. Pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take the agony from the strange wounds. At last his head fell heavily upon the cushion. Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse of vitality. It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was ease from pain.To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of his condition Stackhurst turned upon me.\a147My God!\a148 he cried, \a147what is it, Holmes? What is it?\a148\a147Where did you find him?\a148\a147Down on the beach. Exactly where poor McPherson met his end. If this man\a146s heart had been weak as McPherson\a146s was, he would not be here now. More than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up. It was too far to The Gables, so I made for you.\a148\a147Did you see him on the beach?\a148\a147I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry. He was at the edge of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. I ran down, threw some clothes about him, and brought him up. For heaven\a146s sake, Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. Can you, with all your world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?\a148\a147I think I can, Stackhurst. Come with me now! And you, Inspector, come along! We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your hands.\a148Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all three went down to the deadly lagoon. On the shingle there was piled a little heap of towels and clothes left by the stricken man. Slowly I walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind me. Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep. It was to this part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful pellucid green pool as clear as crystal. A line of rocks lay above it at the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly into the depths beneath me. I had reached the deepest and stillest pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I burst into a shout of triumph.\a147Cyanea!\a148 I cried. \a147Cyanea! Behold the Lion\a146s Mane!\a148The strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled mass torn from the mane of a lion. It lay upon a rocky shelf some three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses. It pulsated with a slow, heavy dilation and contraction.\a147It has done mischief enough. Its day is over!\a148 I cried. \a147Help me, Stackhurst! Let us end the murderer forever.\a148There was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it fell with a tremendous splash into the water. When the ripples had cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. One flapping edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. A thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round, rising slowly to the surface.\a147Well, this gets me!\a148 cried the inspector. \a147What was it, Mr. Holmes? I\a146m born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing. It don\a146t belong to Sussex.\a148\a147Just as well for Sussex,\a148 I remarked. \a147It may have been the southwest gale that brought it up. Come back to my house, both of you, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who has good reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.\a148When we reached my study we found that Murdoch was so far recovered that he could sit up. He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was shaken by a paroxysm of pain. In broken words he explained that he had no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to reach the bank.\a147\tHere is a book,\a148 I said, taking up the little volume, \a147which first brought light into what might have been forever dark. It is Out of Doors, by the famous observer, J. G. Wood. Wood himself very nearly perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very full knowledge. Cyanea capillata is the miscreant\a146s full name, and he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite of the cobra. Let me briefly give this extract.\t\a147\tIf the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion\a146s mane and silver paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, Cyanea capillata. \tCould our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described?\a147\tHe goes on to tell of his own encounter with one when swimming off the coast of Kent. He found that the creature radiated almost invisible filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death. Even at a distance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal.\t\a147\tThe multitudinous threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves. \t\a147\tThe local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite torment.\t\a147\tPangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if struck by a bullet. The pulsation would cease, and then the heart would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the chest. \t\a147It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool. He says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white, wrinkled and shrivelled was his face. He gulped down brandy, a whole bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. There is the book, Inspector. I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.\a148\a147And incidentally exonerates me,\a148 remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry smile. \a147I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your suspicions were natural. I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.\a148\a147No, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the track, and had I been out as early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific experience.\a148\a147But how did you know, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles. That phrase \a145the Lion\a146s Mane\a146 haunted my mind. I knew that I had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. You have seen that it does describe the creature. I have no doubt that it was floating on the water when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been his death.\a148\a147Then I, at least, am cleared,\a148 said Murdoch, rising slowly to his feet. \a147There are one or two words of explanation which I should give, for I know the direction in which your inquiries have run. It is true that I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend McPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness. I was well content to stand aside and act as their go-between. Often I carried their messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and because she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my friend\a146s death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and heartless manner. She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest you should disapprove and I might suffer. But with your leave I must try to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.\a148Stackhurst held out his hand. \a147Our nerves have all been at concert-pitch,\a148 said he. \a147Forgive what is past, Murdoch. We shall understand each other better in the future.\a148 They passed out together with their arms linked in friendly fashion. The inspector remained, staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes.\a147Well, you\a146ve done it!\a148 he cried at last. \a147I had read of you, but I never believed it. It\a146s wonderful!\a148I was forced to shake my head. To accept such praise was to lower one\a146s own standards.\a147I was slow at the outset\a151 culpably slow. Had the body been found in the water I could hardly have missed it. It was the towel which misled me. The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn was led to believe that he had never been in the water. Why, then, should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me? That was where I went astray. Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff you gentlemen of the police force, but Cyanea capillata very nearly avenged Scotland Yard.\a148\p\X1\BThe Retired Colourman\B\X1\c\i\m="reti-04.png"\i\cSherlock Holmes was in a melancholy and philosophic mood that morning. His alert practical nature was subject to such reactions.\a147Did you see him?\a148 he asked.\a147You mean the old fellow who has just gone out?\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147Yes, I met him at the door.\a148\a147What did you think of him?\a148\a147A pathetic, futile, broken creature.\a148\a147Exactly, Watson. Pathetic and futile. But is not all life pathetic and futile? Is not his story a microcosm of the whole? We reach. We grasp. And what is left in our hands at the end? A shadow. Or worse than a shadow\a151 misery.\a148\a147Is he one of your clients?\a148\a147Well, I suppose I may call him so. He has been sent on by the Yard. Just as medical men occasionally send their incurables to a quack. They argue that they can do nothing more, and that whatever happens the patient can be no worse than he is.\a148\a147What is the matter?\a148Holmes took a rather soiled card from the table. \a147Josiah Amberley. He says he was junior partner of Brickfall and Amberley, who are manufacturers of artistic materials. You will see their names upon paint-boxes. He made his little pile, retired from business at the age of sixty-one, bought a house at Lewisham, and settled down to rest after a life of ceaseless grind. One would think his future was tolerably assured.\a148\a147Yes, indeed.\a148Holmes glanced over some notes which he had scribbled upon the back of an envelope.\a147Retired in 1896, Watson. Early in 1897 he married a woman twenty years younger than himself\a151 a good-looking woman, too, if the photograph does not flatter. A competence, a wife, leisure\a151 it seemed a straight road which lay before him. And yet within two years he is, as you have seen, as broken and miserable a creature as crawls beneath the sun.\a148\a147But what has happened?\a148\a147The old story, Watson. A treacherous friend and a fickle wife. It would appear that Amberley has one hobby in life, and it is chess. Not far from him at Lewisham there lives a young doctor who is also a chess-player. I have noted his name as Dr. Ray Ernest. Ernest was frequently in the house, and an intimacy between him and Mrs. Amberley was a natural sequence, for you must admit that our unfortunate client has few outward graces, whatever his inner virtues may be. The couple went off together last week\a151 destination untraced. What is more, the faithless spouse carried off the old man\a146s deed-box as her personal luggage with a good part of his life\a146s savings within. Can we find the lady? Can we save the money? A commonplace problem so far as it has developed, and yet a vital one for Josiah Amberley.\a148\a147What will you do about it?\a148\a147Well, the immediate question, my dear Watson, happens to be, What will you do?if you will be good enough to understudy me. You know that I am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic Patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day. I really have not time to go out to Lewisham, and yet evidence taken on the spot has a special value. The old fellow was quite insistent that I should go, but I explained my difficulty. He is prepared to meet a representative.\a148\a147By all means,\a148 I answered. \a147I confess I don\a146t see that I can be of much service, but I am willing to do my best.\a148 And so it was that on a summer afternoon I set forth to Lewisham, little dreaming that within a week the affair in which I was engaging would be the eager debate of all England.It was late that evening before I returned to Baker Street and gave an account of my mission. Holmes lay with his gaunt figure stretched in his deep chair, his pipe curling forth slow wreaths of acrid tobacco, while his eyelids drooped over his eyes so lazily that he might almost have been asleep were it not that at any halt or questionable passage of my narrative they half lifted, and two gray eyes, as bright and keen as rapiers, transfixed me with their searching glance.\a147The Haven is the name of Mr. Josiah Amberley\a146s house,\a148 I explained. \a147I think it would interest you, Holmes. It is like some penurious patrician who has sunk into the company of his inferiors. You know that particular quarter, the monotonous brick streets, the weary suburban highways. Right in the middle of them, a little island of ancient culture and comfort, lies this old home, surrounded by a high sun-baked wall mottled with lichens and topped with moss, the sort of wall\a151\a148\a147Cut out the poetry, Watson,\a148 said Holmes severely. \a147I note that it was a high brick wall.\a148\a147Exactly. I should not have known which was The Haven had I not asked a lounger who was smoking in the street. I have a reason for mentioning him. He was a tall, dark, heavily moustached, rather military-looking man. He nodded in answer to my inquiry and gave me a curiously questioning glance, which came back to my memory a little later.\a147I had hardly entered the gateway before I saw Mr. Amberley coming down the drive. I only had a glimpse of him this morning, and he certainly gave me the impression of a strange creature, but when I saw him in full light his appearance was even more abnormal.\a148\a147I have, of course, studied it, and yet I should be interested to have your impression,\a148 said Holmes.\a147He seemed to me like a man who was literally bowed down by care. His back was curved as though he carried a heavy burden. Yet he was not the weakling that I had at first imagined, for his shoulders and chest have the framework of a giant, though his figure tapers away into a pair of spindled legs.\a148\a147Left shoe wrinkled, right one smooth.\a148\a147I did not observe that.\a148\a147No, you wouldn\a146t. I spotted his artificial limb. But proceed.\a148\a147I was struck by the snaky locks of grizzled hair which curled from under his old straw hat, and his face with its fierce, eager expression and the deeply lined features.\a148\a147Very good, Watson. What did he say?\a148\a147He began pouring out the story of his grievances. We walked down the drive together, and of course I took a good look round. I have never seen a worse-kept place. The garden was all running to seed, giving me an impression of wild neglect in which the plants had been allowed to find the way of Nature rather than of art. How any decent woman could have tolerated such a state of things, I don\a146t know. The house, too, was slatternly to the last degree, but the poor man seemed himself to be aware of it and to be trying to remedy it, for a great pot of green paint stood in the centre of the hall, and he was carrying a thick brush in his left hand. He had been working on the woodwork.\a147He took me into his dingy sanctum, and we had a long chat. Of course, he was disappointed that you had not come yourself. \a145I hardly expected,\a146 he said, \a145that so humble an individual as myself, especially after my heavy financial loss, could obtain the complete attention of so famous a man as Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a147I assured him that the financial question did not arise. \a145No of course, it is art for art\a146s sake with him,\a146 said he, \a145but even on the artistic side of crime he might have found something here to study. And human nature, Dr. Watson\a151 the black ingratitude of it all! When did I ever refuse one of her requests? Was ever a woman so pampered? And that young man\a151 he might have been my own son. He had the run of my house. And yet see how they have treated me! Oh, Dr. Watson, it is a dreadful, dreadful world!\a146\a147That was the burden of his song for an hour or more. He had, it seems, no suspicion of an intrigue. They lived alone save for a woman who comes in by the day and leaves every evening at six. On that particular evening old Amberley, wishing to give his wife a treat, had taken two upper circle seats at the Haymarket Theatre. At the last moment she had complained of a headache and had refused to go. He had gone alone. There seemed to be no doubt about the fact, for he produced the unused ticket which he had taken for his wife.\a148\a147That is remarkable\a151 most remarkable,\a148 said Holmes, whose interest in the case seemed to be rising. \a147Pray continue, Watson. I find your narrative most arresting. Did you personally examine this ticket? You did not, perchance, take the number?\a148\a147It so happens that I did,\a148 I answered with some pride. \a147It chanced to be my old school number, thirty-one, and so is stuck in my head.\a148\a147Excellent, Watson! His seat, then, was either thirty or thirty-two.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 I answered with some mystification. \a147And on B row.\a148\a147That is most satisfactory. What else did he tell you?\a148\a147He showed me his strong-room, as he called it. It really is a strong-room\a151 like a bank\a151 with iron door and shutter\a151 burglarproof, as he claimed. However, the woman seems to have had a duplicate key, and between them they had carried off some seven thousand pounds\a146 worth of cash and securities.\a148\a147Securities! How could they dispose of those?\a148\a147He said that he had given the police a list and that he hoped they would be unsaleable. He had got back from the theatre about midnight and found the place plundered, the door and window open, and the fugitives gone. There was no letter or message, nor has he heard a word since. He at once gave the alarm to the police.\a148Holmes brooded for some minutes.\a147You say he was painting. What was he painting?\a148\a147Well, he was painting the passage. But he had already painted the door and woodwork of this room I spoke of.\a148\a147Does it not strike you as a strange occupation in the circumstances?\a148\a147\a160\a145One must do something to ease an aching heart.\a146 That was his own explanation. It was eccentric, no doubt, but he is clearly an eccentric man. He tore up one of his wife\a146s photographs in my presence\a151 tore it up furiously in a tempest of passion. \a145I never wish to see her damned face again,\a146 he shrieked.\a148\a147Anything more, Watson?\a148\a147Yes, one thing which struck me more than anything else. I had driven to the Blackheath Station and had caught my train there when, just as it was starting, I saw a man dart into the carriage next to my own. You know that I have a quick eye for faces, Holmes. It was undoubtedly the tall, dark man whom I had addressed in the street. I saw him once more at London Bridge, and then I lost him in the crowd. But I am convinced that he was following me.\a148\a147No doubt! No doubt!\a148 said Holmes. \a147A tall, dark, heavily moustached man, you say, with gray-tinted sun-glasses?\a148\a147Holmes, you are a wizard. I did not say so, but he had gray-tinted sun-glasses.\a148\a147And a Masonic tie-pin?\a148\a147Holmes!\a148\a147Quite simple, my dear Watson. But let us get down to what is practical. I must admit to you that the case, which seemed to me to be so absurdly simple as to be hardly worth my notice, is rapidly assuming a very different aspect. It is true that though in your mission you have missed everything of importance, yet even those things which have obtruded themselves upon your notice give rise to serious thought.\a148\a147What have I missed?\a148\a147Don\a146t be hurt, my dear fellow. You know that I am quite impersonal. No one else would have done better. Some possibly not so well. But clearly you have missed some vital points. What is the opinion of the neighbours about this man Amberley and his wife? That surely is of importance. What of Dr. Ernest? Was he the gay Lothario one would expect? With your natural advantages, Watson, every lady is your helper and accomplice. What about the girl at the post-office, or the wife of the greengrocer? I can picture you whispering soft nothings with the young lady at the Blue Anchor, and receiving hard somethings in exchange. All this you have left undone.\a148\a147It can still be done.\a148\a147It has been done. Thanks to the telephone and the help of the Yard, I can usually get my essentials without leaving this room. As a matter of fact, my information confirms the man\a146s story. He has the local repute of being a miser as well as a harsh and exacting husband. That he had a large sum of money in that strong-room of his is certain. So also is it that young Dr. Ernest, an unmarried man, played chess with Amberley, and probably played the fool with his wife. All this seems plain sailing, and one would think that there was no more to be said\a151 and yet!and yet!\a148\a147Where lies the difficulty?\a148\a147In my imagination, perhaps. Well, leave it there, Watson. Let us escape from this weary workaday world by the side door of music. Carina sings to-night at the Albert Hall, and we still have time to dress, dine, and enjoy.\a148I\tn the morning I was up betimes, but some toast crumbs and two empty eggshells told me that my companion was earlier still. I found a scribbled note upon the table.\tD\tEAR WATSON:\tT\there are one or two points of contact which I should wish to establish with Mr. Josiah Amberley. When I have done so we can dismiss the case\a151 or not. I would only ask you to be on hand about three o\a146clock, as I conceive it possible that I may want you.\tS\t.H. \tI saw nothing of Holmes all day, but at the hour named he returned, grave, preoccupied, and aloof. At such times it was wiser to leave him to himself.\a147Has Amberley been here yet?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Ah! I am expecting him.\a148He was not disappointed, for presently the old fellow arrived with a very worried and puzzled expression upon his austere face.\a147\tI\a146ve had a telegram, Mr. Holmes. I can make nothing of it.\a148 He handed it over, and Holmes read it aloud.\t\a147\tCome at once without fail. Can give you information as to your recent loss.\t\a147\tELMAN.\t\a147\tThe Vicarage. \t\a147Dispatched at 2:10 from Little Purlington,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Little Purlington is in Essex, I believe, not far from Frinton. Well, of course you will start at once. This is evidently from a responsible person, the vicar of the place. Where is my Crockford? Yes, here we have him: \a145J. C. Elman, M. A., Living of Moosmoor cum Little Purlington.\a146 Look up the trains, Watson.\a148\a147There is one at 5:20 from Liverpool Street.\a148\a147Excellent. You had best go with him, Watson. He may need help or advice. Clearly we have come to a crisis in this affair.\a148But our client seemed by no means eager to start.\a147It\a146s perfectly absurd, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147What can this man possibly know of what has occurred? It is waste of time and money.\a148\a147He would not have telegraphed to you if he did not know something. Wire at once that you are coming.\a148\a147I don\a146t think I shall go.\a148Holmes assumed his sternest aspect.\a147It would make the worst possible impression both on the police and upon myself, Mr. Amberley, if when so obvious a clue arose you should refuse to follow it up. We should feel that you were not really in earnest in this investigation.\a148Our client seemed horrified at the suggestion.\a147Why, of course I shall go if you look at it in that way,\a148 said he. \a147On the face of it, it seems absurd to suppose that this parson knows anything, but if you think\a151\a148\a147I do think,\a148 said Holmes with emphasis, and so we were launched upon our journey. Holmes took me aside before we left the room and gave me one word of counsel, which showed that he considered the matter to be of importance. \a147Whatever you do, see that he really does go,\a148 said he. \a147Should he break away or return, get to the nearest telephone exchange and send the single word \a145Bolted.\a146 I will arrange here that it shall reach me wherever I am.\a148Little Purlington is not an easy place to reach, for it is on a branch line. My remembrance of the journey is not a pleasant one, for the weather was hot, the train slow, and my companion sullen and silent, hardly talking at all save to make an occasional sardonic remark as to the futility of our proceedings. When we at last reached the little station it was a two-mile drive before we came to the Vicarage, where a big, solemn, rather pompous clergyman received us in his study. Our telegram lay before him.\a147Well, gentlemen,\a148 he asked, \a147what can I do for you?\a148\a147We came,\a148 I explained, \a147in answer to your wire.\a148\a147My wire! I sent no wire.\a148\a147I mean the wire which you sent to Mr. Josiah Amberley about his wife and his money.\a148\a147If this is a joke, sir, it is a very questionable one,\a148 said the vicar angrily. \a147I have never heard of the gentleman you name, and I have not sent a wire to anyone.\a148Our client and I looked at each other in amazement.\a147Perhaps there is some mistake,\a148 said I; \a147are there perhaps two vicarages? Here is the wire itself, signed Elman and dated from the Vicarage.\a148\a147There is only one vicarage, sir, and only one vicar, and this wire is a scandalous forgery, the origin of which shall certainly be investigated by the police. Meanwhile, I can see no possible object in prolonging this interview.\a148So Mr. Amberley and I found ourselves on the roadside in what seemed to me to be the most primitive village in England. We made for the telegraph office, but it was already closed. There was a telephone, however, at the little Railway Arms, and by it I got into touch with Holmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey.\a147Most singular!\a148 said the distant voice. \a147Most remarkable! I much fear, my dear Watson, that there is no return train to-night. I have unwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn. However, there is always Nature, Watson\a151 Nature and Josiah Amberley\a151 you can be in close commune with both.\a148 I heard his dry chuckle as he turned away.It was soon apparent to me that my companion\a146s reputation as a miser was not undeserved. He had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had insisted upon travelling third-class, and was now clamorous in his objections to the hotel bill. Next morning, when we did at last arrive in London, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour.\a147You had best take Baker Street as we pass,\a148 said I. \a147Mr. Holmes may have some fresh instructions.\a148\a147If they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much use,\a148 said Amberley with a malevolent scowl. None the less, he kept me company. I had already warned Holmes by telegram of the hour of our arrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at Lewisham and would expect us there. That was a surprise, but an even greater one was to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client. A stern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with gray-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from his tie.\a147This is my friend Mr. Barker,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He has been interesting himself also in your business, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been working independently. But we both have the same question to ask you!\a148Mr. Amberley sat down heavily. He sensed impending danger. I read it in his straining eyes and his twitching features.\a147What is the question, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Only this: What did you do with the bodies?\a148The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream. He clawed into the air with his bony hands. His mouth was open, and for the instant he looked like some horrible bird of prey. In a flash we got a glimpse of the real Josiah Amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as his body. As he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his lips as if to stifle a cough. Holmes sprang at his throat like a tiger and twisted his face towards the ground. A white pellet fell from between his gasping lips.\a147No short cuts, Josiah Amberley. Things must be done decently and in order. What about it, Barker?\a148\a147I have a cab at the door,\a148 said our taciturn companion.\a147It is only a few hundred yards to the station. We will go together. You can stay here, Watson. I shall be back within half an hour.\a148The old colourman had the strength of a lion in that great trunk of his, but he was helpless in the hands of the two experienced man-handlers. Wriggling and twisting he was dragged to the waiting cab, and I was left to my solitary vigil in the ill-omened house. In less time than he had named, however, Holmes was back, in company with a smart young police inspector.\a147I\a146ve left Barker to look after the formalities,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You had not met Barker, Watson. He is my hated rival upon the Surrey shore. When you said a tall dark man it was not difficult for me to complete the picture. He has several good cases to his credit, has he not, Inspector?\a148\a147He has certainly interfered several times,\a148 the inspector answered with reserve.\a147His methods are irregular, no doubt, like my own. The irregulars are useful sometimes, you know. You, for example, with your compulsory warning about whatever he said being used against him, could never have bluffed this rascal into what is virtually a confession.\a148\a147Perhaps not. But we get there all the same, Mr. Holmes. Don\a146t imagine that we had not formed our own views of this case, and that we would not have laid our hands on our man. You will excuse us for feeling sore when you jump in with methods which we cannot use, and so rob us of the credit.\a148\a147There shall be no such robbery, MacKinnon. I assure you that I efface myself from now onward, and as to Barker, he has done nothing save what I told him.\a148The inspector seemed considerably relieved.\a147That is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. Praise or blame can matter little to you, but it is very different to us when the newspapers begin to ask questions.\a148\a147Quite so. But they are pretty sure to ask questions anyhow, so it would be as well to have answers. What will you say, for example, when the intelligent and enterprising reporter asks you what the exact points were which aroused your suspicion, and finally gave you a certain conviction as to the real facts?\a148The inspector looked puzzled.\a147We don\a146t seem to have got any real facts yet, Mr. Holmes. You say that the prisoner, in the presence of three witnesses, practically confessed by trying to commit suicide, that he had murdered his wife and her lover. What other facts have you?\a148\a147Have you arranged for a search?\a148\a147There are three constables on their way.\a148\a147Then you will soon get the clearest fact of all. The bodies cannot be far away. Try the cellars and the garden. It should not take long to dig up the likely places. This house is older than the water-pipes. There must be a disused well somewhere. Try your luck there.\a148\a147But how did you know of it, and how was it done?\a148\a147I\a146ll show you first how it was done, and then I will give the explanation which is due to you, and even more to my longsuffering friend here, who has been invaluable throughout. But, first, I would give you an insight into this man\a146s mentality. It is a very unusual one\a151 so much so that I think his destination is more likely to be Broadmoor than the scaffold. He has, to a high degree, the sort of mind which one associates with the mediaeval Italian nature rather than with the modern Briton. He was a miserable miser who made his wife so wretched by his niggardly ways that she was a ready prey for any adventurer. Such a one came upon the scene in the person of this chess-playing doctor. Amberley excelled at chess\a151 one mark, Watson, of a scheming mind. Like all misers, he was a jealous man, and his jealousy became a frantic mania. Rightly or wrongly, he suspected an intrigue. He determined to have his revenge, and he planned it with diabolical cleverness. Come here!\a148Holmes led us along the passage with as much certainty as if he had lived in the house and halted at the open door of the strong-room.\a147Pooh! What an awful smell of paint!\a148 cried the inspector.\a147That was our first clue,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You can thank Dr. Watson\a146s observation for that, though he failed to draw the inference. It set my foot upon the trail. Why should this man at such a time be filling his house with strong odours? Obviously, to cover some other smell which he wished to conceal\a151 some guilty smell which would suggest suspicions. Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with iron door and shutter\a151 a hermetically sealed room. Put those two facts together, and whither do they lead? I could only determine that by examining the house myself. I was already certain that the case was serious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket Theatre\a151 another of Dr. Watson\a146s bull\a146s-eyes\a151 and ascertained that neither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied that night. Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his alibi fell to the ground. He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute friend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife. The question now arose how I might be able to examine the house. I sent an agent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my man to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back. To prevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him. The good vicar\a146s name I took, of course, out of my Crockford. Do I make it all clear to you?\a148\a147It is masterly,\a148 said the inspector in an awed voice.\a147There being no fear of interruption I proceeded to burgle the house. Burglary has always been an alternative profession had I cared to adopt it, and I have little doubt that I should have come to the front. Observe what I found. You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here. Very good. It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here in the corner. The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see, and ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is concealed by the ornamentation. That end is wide open. At any moment by turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas. With door and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two minutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little chamber. By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know, but once inside the door they were at his mercy.\a148The inspector examined the pipe with interest. \a147One of our officers mentioned the smell of gas,\a148 said he, \a147but of course the window and door were open then, and the paint\a151 or some of it\a151 was already about. He had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his story. But what next, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself. I was slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a hand inside my collar, and a voice said: \a145Now, you rascal, what are you doing in there?\a146 When I could twist my head round I looked into the tinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker. It was a curious foregathering and set us both smiling. It seems that he had been engaged by Dr. Ray Ernest\a146s family to make some investigations and had come to the same conclusion as to foul play. He had watched the house for some days and had spotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously suspicious characters who had called there. He could hardly arrest Watson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry window there came a limit to his restraint. Of course, I told him how matters stood and we continued the case together.\a148\a147Why him? Why not us?\a148\a147Because it was in my mind to put that little test which answered so admirably. I fear you would not have gone so far.\a148The inspector smiled.\a147Well, maybe not. I understand that I have your word, Mr. Holmes, that you step right out of the case now and that you turn all your results over to us.\a148\a147Certainly, that is always my custom.\a148\a147Well, in the name of the force I thank you. It seems a clear case, as you put it, and there can\a146t be much difficulty over the bodies.\a148\a147I\a146ll show you a grim little bit of evidence,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and I am sure Amberley himself never observed it. You\a146ll get results, Inspector, by always putting yourself in the other fellow\a146s place, and thinking what you would do yourself. It takes some imagination, but it pays. Now, we will suppose that you were shut up in this little room, had not two minutes to live, but wanted to get even with the fiend who was probably mocking at you from the other side of the door. What would you do?\a148\a147Write a message.\a148\a147Exactly. You would like to tell people how you died. No use writing on paper. That would be seen. If you wrote on the wall someone might rest upon it. Now, look here! Just above the skirting is scribbled with a purple indelible pencil: \a145We we\a151\a146 That\a146s all.\a146\a146\a147What do you make of that?\a148\a147Well, it\a146s only a foot above the ground. The poor devil was on the floor dying when he wrote it. He lost his senses before he could finish.\a148\a147He was writing, \a145We were murdered.\a146\a160\a148\a147That\a146s how I read it. If you find an indelible pencil on the body\a151\a148\a147We\a146ll look out for it, you may be sure. But those securities? Clearly there was no robbery at all. And yet he did possess those bonds. We verified that.\a148\a147You may be sure he has them hidden in a safe place. When the whole elopement had passed into history, he would suddenly discover them and announce that the guilty couple had relented and sent back the plunder or had dropped it on the way.\a148\a147You certainly seem to have met every difficulty,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Of course, he was bound to call us in, but why he should have gone to you I can\a146t understand.\a148\a147Pure swank!\a148 Holmes answered. \a147He felt so clever and so sure of himself that he imagined no one could touch him. He could say to any suspicious neighbour, \a145Look at the steps I have taken. I have consulted not only the police but even Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a160\a148The inspector laughed.\a147We must forgive you your \a145even,\a146 Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he \a147it\a146s as workmanlike a job as I can remember.\a148A\t couple of days later my friend tossed across to me a copy of the bi-weekly North Surrey Observer. Under a series of flaming headlines, which began with \a147The Haven Horror\a148 and ended with \a147Brilliant Police Investigation,\a148 there was a packed column of print which gave the first consecutive account of the affair. The concluding paragraph is typical of the whole. It ran thus:\tT\the remarkable acumen by which Inspector MacKinnon deduced from the smell of paint that some other smell, that of gas, for example, might be concealed; the bold deduction that the strong-room might also be the death-chamber, and the subsequent inquiry which led to the discovery of the bodies in a disused well, cleverly concealed by a dogkennel, should live in the history of crime as a standing example of the intelligence of our professional detectives. \t\a147Well, well, MacKinnon is a good fellow,\a148 said Holmes with a tolerant smile. \a147You can file it in our archives, Watson. Some day the true story may be told.\a148\p\X1\BThe Veiled Lodger\B\X1\c\i\m="veil-03.png"\i\cWhen one considers that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was in active practice for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was allowed to cooperate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it will be clear that I have a mass of material at my command. The problem has always been not to find but to choose. There is the long row of year-books which fill a shelf and there are the dispatch-cases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the student not only of crime but of the social and official scandals of the late Victorian era. Concerning these latter, I may say that the writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched, have nothing to fear. The discretion and high sense of professional honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr. Holmes\a146s authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. There is at least one reader who will understand.It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs. Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it fell easily into his lap. But the most terrible human tragedies were often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record. In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but otherwise the facts are as stated.One forenoon\a151 it was late in 1896I received a hurried note from Holmes asking for my attendance. When I arrived I found him seated in a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.\a147This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\a148 said my friend with a wave of the hand. \a147Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if you wish to indulge your filthy habits. Mrs. Merrilow has an interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments in which your presence may be useful.\a148\a147Anything I can do\a151\a148\a147You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I should prefer to have a witness. You will make her understand that before we arrive.\a148\a147Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said our visitor, \a147she is that anxious to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!\a148\a147Then we shall come early in the afternoon. Let us see that we have our facts correct before we start. If we go over them it will help Dr. Watson to understand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ronder has been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her face.\a148\a147And I wish to God I had not!\a148 said Mrs. Merrilow.\a147It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.\a148\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. That\a146s how it looked. Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the front garden. That is the kind of face it is. When I saw her\a151 I happened on her unawares\a151 she covered up quick, and then she said, \a145Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my veil.\a146\a160\a148\a147Do you know anything about her history?\a148\a147Nothing at all.\a148\a147Did she give references when she came?\a148\a147No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. A quarter\a146s rent right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. In these times a poor woman like me can\a146t afford to turn down a chance like that.\a148\a147Did she give any reason for choosing your house?\a148\a147Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most. Then, again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own. I reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. It\a146s privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.\a148\a147You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on the one accidental occasion. Well, it is a very remarkable story, most remarkable, and I don\a146t wonder that you want it examined.\a148\a147I don\a146t, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent. You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\a148\a147Then what has brought matters to a head?\a148\a147Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there\a146s something terrible on her mind. \a145Murder!\a146 she cries. \a145Murder!\a146 And once I heard her: \a145You cruel beast! You monster!\a146 she cried. It was in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers through me. So I went to her in the morning. \a145Mrs. Ronder,\a146 I says, \a145if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there\a146s the clergy,\a146 I says, \a145and there\a146s the police. Between them you should get some help.\a146 \a145For God\a146s sake, not the police!\a146 says she, \a145and the clergy can\a146t change what is past. And yet,\a146 she says, \a145it would ease my mind if someone knew the truth before I died.\a146 \a145Well,\a146 says I, \a145if you won\a146t have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read about\a146beggin\a146 your pardon, Mr. Holmes. And she, she fair jumped at it. \a145That\a146s the man,\a146 says she. \a145I wonder I never thought of it before. Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if he won\a146t come, tell him I am the wife of Ronder\a146s wild beast show. Say that, and give him the name Abbas Parva. Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. \a145That will bring him if he\a146s the man I think he is.\a146\a160\a148\a147And it will, too,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147Very good, Mrs. Merrilow. I should like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us till lunch-time. About three o\a146clock you may expect to see us at your house in Brixton.\a148Our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room\a151 no other verb can describe Mrs. Merrilow\a146s method of progression\a151 than Sherlock Holmes threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books in the corner. For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he sought. So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the floor like some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all round him, and one open upon his knees.\a147The case worried me at the time, Watson. Here are my marginal notes to prove it. I confess that I could make nothing of it. And yet I was convinced that the coroner was wrong. Have you no recollection of the Abbas Parva tragedy?\a148\a147None, Holmes.\a148\a147And yet you were with me then. But certainly my own impression was very superficial. For there was nothing to go by, and none of the parties had engaged my services. Perhaps you would care to read the papers?\a148\a147Could you not give me the points?\a148\a147That is very easily done. It will probably come back to your memory as I talk. Ronder, of course, was a household word. He was the rival of Wombwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day. There is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy. The caravan had halted for the night at Abbas Parva, which is a small village in Berkshire, when this horror occurred. They were on their way to Wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not have paid them to open.\a147They had among their exhibits a very fine North African lion. Sahara King was its name, and it was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife, to give exhibitions inside its cage. Here, you see, is a photograph of the performance by which you will perceive that Ronder was a huge porcine person and that his wife was a very magnificent woman. It was deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion was dangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no notice was taken of the fact.\a147It was usual for either Ronder or his wife to feed the lion at night. Sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors and would never molest them. On this particular night, seven years ago, they both went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which have never been made clear.\a147It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars of the animal and the screams of the woman. The different grooms and employees rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their light an awful sight was revealed. Ronder lay, with the back of his head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards from the cage, which was open. Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs. Ronder upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above her. It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought that she could live. Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo, the strong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked in. How it had got loose was a mystery. It was conjectured that the pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed the creature bounded out upon them. There was no other point of interest in the evidence save that the woman in a delirium of agony kept screaming, \a145Coward! Coward!\a146 as she was carried back to the van in which they lived. It was six months before she was fit to give evidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of death from misadventure.\a148\a147What alternative could be conceived?\a148 said I.\a147You may well say so. And yet there were one or two points which worried young Edmunds, of the Berkshire Constabulary. A smart lad that! He was sent later to Allahabad. That was how I came into the matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.\a148\a147A thin, yellow-haired man?\a148\a147Exactly. I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.\a148\a147But what worried him?\a148\a147Well, we were both worried. It was so deucedly difficult to reconstruct the affair. Look at it from the lion\a146s point of view. He is liberated. What does he do? He takes half a dozen bounds forward, which brings him to Ronder. Ronder turns to fly\a151 the claw-marks were on the back of his head\a151 but the lion strikes him down. Then, instead of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. Then, again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had in some way failed her. What could the poor devil have done to help her? You see the difficulty?\a148\a147Quite.\a148\a147And then there was another thing. It comes back to me now as I think it over. There was some evidence that just at the time the lion roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.\a148\a147This man Ronder, no doubt.\a148\a147Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear from him again. There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman.\a148\a147I should think the whole camp was crying out by then. As to the other points, I think I could suggest a solution.\a148\a147I should be glad to consider it.\a148\a147The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got loose. The man turned and was struck down. The woman conceived the idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. It was her only refuge. She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded after her and knocked her over. She was angry with her husband for having encouraged the beast\a146s rage by turning. If they had faced it they might have cowed it. Hence her cries of \a145Coward!\a146\a160\a148\a147Brilliant, Watson! Only one flaw in your diamond.\a148\a147What is the flaw, Holmes?\a148\a147If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get loose?\a148\a147Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?\a148\a147And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?\a148\a147Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.\a148Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.\a147Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. Ronder was a man of many enemies. Edmunds told me that in his cups he was horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone who came in his way. I expect those cries about a monster, of which our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear departed. However, our speculations are futile until we have all the facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a fresh call upon them.\a148When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired abode. It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end. Then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight, badly carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious lodger.It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected, since its inmate seldom left it. From keeping beasts in a cage, the woman seemed, by some retribution of fate, to have become herself a beast in a cage. She sat now in a broken armchair in the shadowy corner of the room. Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was still full and voluptuous. A thick dark veil covered her face, but it was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed a perfectly shaped mouth and a delicately rounded chin. I could well conceive that she had indeed been a very remarkable woman. Her voice, too, was well modulated and pleasing.\a147My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said she. \a147I thought that it would bring you.\a148\a147That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was interested in your case.\a148\a147I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr. Edmunds, the county detective. I fear I lied to him. Perhaps it would have been wiser had I told the truth.\a148\a147It is usually wiser to tell the truth. But why did you lie to him?\a148\a147Because the fate of someone else depended upon it. I know that he was a very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction upon my conscience. We had been so close\a151 so close!\a148\a147But has this impediment been removed?\a148\a147Yes, sir. The person that I allude to is dead.\a148\a147Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?\a148\a147Because there is another person to be considered. That other person is myself. I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would come from a police examination. I have not long to live, but I wish to die undisturbed. And yet I wanted to find one man of judgment to whom I could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might be understood.\a148\a147You compliment me, madam. At the same time, I am a responsible person. I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.\a148\a147I think not, Mr. Holmes. I know your character and methods too well, for I have followed your work for some years. Reading is the only pleasure which fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in the world. But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which you may make of my tragedy. It will ease my mind to tell it.\a148\a147My friend and I would be glad to hear it.\a148The woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. He was clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile breaking from under his heavy moustache\a151 the self-satisfied smile of the man of many conquests.\a147That is Leonardo,\a148 she said.\a147Leonardo, the strong man, who gave evidence?\a148\a147The same. And this\a151 this is my husband.\a148It was a dreadful face\a151 a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for it was formidable in its bestiality. One could imagine that vile mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon the world. Ruffian, bully, beast\a151 it was all written on that heavy-jowled face.\a147Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the story. I was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing springs through the hoop before I was ten. When I became a woman this man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil moment I became his wife. From that day I was in hell, and he the devil who tormented me. There was no one in the show who did not know of his treatment. He deserted me for others. He tied me down and lashed me with his ridingwhip when I complained. They all pitied me and they all loathed him, but what could they do? They feared him, one and all. For he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he was drunk. Again and again he was had up for assault, and for cruelty to the beasts, but he had plenty of money and the fines were nothing to him. The best men all left us, and the show began to go downhill. It was only Leonardo and I who kept it up\a151 with little Jimmy Griggs, the clown. Poor devil, he had not much to be funny about, but he did what he could to hold things together.\a147Then Leonardo came more and more into my life. You see what he was like. I know now the poor spirit that was hidden in that splendid body, but compared to my husband he seemed like the angel Gabriel. He pitied me and helped me, till at last our intimacy turned to love\a151 deep, deep, passionate love, such love as I had dreamed of but never hoped to feel. My husband suspected it, but I think that he was a coward as well as a bully, and that Leonardo was the one man that he was afraid of. He took revenge in his own way by torturing me more than ever. One night my cries brought Leonardo to the door of our van. We were near tragedy that night, and soon my lover and I understood that it could not be avoided. My husband was not fit to live. We planned that he should die.\a147Leonardo had a clever, scheming brain. It was he who planned it. I do not say that to blame him, for I was ready to go with him every inch of the way. But I should never have had the wit to think of such a plan. We made a club\a151 Leonardo made it\a151 and in the leaden head he fastened five long steel nails, the points outward, with just such a spread as the lion\a146s paw. This was to give my husband his death-blow, and yet to leave the evidence that it was the lion which we would loose who had done the deed.\a147It was a pitch-dark night when my husband and I went down, as was our custom, to feed the beast. We carried with us the raw meat in a zinc pail. Leonardo was waiting at the corner of the big van which we should have to pass before we reached the cage. He was too slow, and we walked past him before he could strike, but he followed us on tiptoe and I heard the crash as the club smashed my husband\a146s skull. My heart leaped with joy at the sound. I sprang forward, and I undid the catch which held the door of the great lion\a146s cage.\a147And then the terrible thing happened. You may have heard how quick these creatures are to scent human blood, and how it excites them. Some strange instinct had told the creature in one instant that a human being had been slain. As I slipped the bars it bounded out and was on me in an instant. Leonardo could have saved me. If he had rushed forward and struck the beast with his club he might have cowed it. But the man lost his nerve. I heard him shout in his terror, and then I saw him turn and fly. At the same instant the teeth of the lion met in my face. Its hot, filthy breath had already poisoned me and I was hardly conscious of pain. With the palms of my hands I tried to push the great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me, and I screamed for help. I was conscious that the camp was stirring, and then dimly I remembered a group of men. Leonardo, Griggs, and others, dragging me from under the creature\a146s paws. That was my last memory, Mr. Holmes, for many a weary month. When I came to myself and saw myself in the mirror, I cursed that lion\a151 oh, how I cursed him!not because he had torn away my beauty but because he had not torn away my life. I had but one desire, Mr. Holmes, and I had enough money to gratify it. It was that I should cover myself so that my poor face should be seen by none, and that I should dwell where none whom I had ever known should find me. That was all that was left to me to do\a151 and that is what I have done. A poor wounded beast that has crawled into its hole to die\a151 that is the end of Eugenia Ronder.\a148We sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her story. Then Holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand with such a show of sympathy as I had seldom known him to exhibit.\a147Poor girl!\a148 he said. \a147Poor girl! The ways of fate are indeed hard to understand. If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the world is a cruel jest. But what of this man Leonardo?\a148\a147I never saw him or heard from him again. Perhaps I have been wrong to feel so bitterly against him. He might as soon have loved one of the freaks whom we carried round the country as the thing which the lion had left. But a woman\a146s love is not so easily set aside. He had left me under the beast\a146s claws, he had deserted me in my need, and yet I could not bring myself to give him to the gallows. For myself, I cared nothing what became of me. What could be more dreadful than my actual life? But I stood between Leonardo and his fate.\a148\a147And he is dead?\a148\a147He was drowned last month when bathing near Margate. I saw his death in the paper.\a148\a147And what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most singular and ingenious part of all your story?\a148\a147I cannot tell, Mr. Holmes. There is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a deep green pool at the base of it. Perhaps in the depths of that pool\a151\a148\a147Well, well, it is of little consequence now. The case is closed.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 said the woman, \a147the case is closed.\a148We had risen to go, but there was something in the woman\a146s voice which arrested Holmes\a146s attention. He turned swiftly upon her.\a147Your life is not your own,\a148 he said. \a147Keep your hands off it.\a148\a147What use is it to anyone?\a148\a147How can you tell? The example of patient suffering is in itself the most precious of all lessons to an impatient world.\a148The woman\a146s answer was a terrible one. She raised her veil and stepped forward into the light.\a147I wonder if you would bear it,\a148 she said.It was horrible. No words can describe the framework of a face when the face itself is gone. Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful. Holmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and together we left the room.Two days later, when I called upon my friend, he pointed with some pride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece. I picked it up. There was a red poison label. A pleasant almondy odour rose when I opened it.\a147Prussic acid?\a148 said 1.\a147Exactly. It came by post. \a145I send you my temptation. I will follow your advice.\a146 That was the message. I think, Watson, we can guess the name of the brave woman who sent it.\a148\p\X1\BShoscombe Old Place\B\X1\c\i\m="shos-05.png"\i\cSherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in triumph.\a147It is glue, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147Unquestionably it is glue. Have a look at these scattered objects in the field!\a148I stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my vision.\a147Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. The irregular grey masses are dust. There are epithelial scales on the left. Those brown blobs in the centre are undoubtedly glue.\a148\a147Well,\a148 I said, laughing, \a147I am prepared to take your word for it. Does anything depend upon it?\a148\a147It is a very fine demonstration,\a148 he answered. \a147In the St. Pancras case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman. The accused man denies that it is his. But he is a picture-frame maker who habitually handles glue.\a148\a147Is it one of your cases?\a148\a147No; my friend, Merivale, of the Yard, asked me to look into the case. Since I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the microscope.\a148 He looked impatiently at his watch. \a147I had a new client calling, but he is overdue. By the way, Watson, you know something of racing?\a148\a147I ought to. I pay for it with about half my wound pension.\a148\a147Then I\a146ll make you my \a145Handy Guide to the Turf.\a146 What about Sir Robert Norberton? Does the name recall anything?\a148\a147Well, I should say so. He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. Norberton nearly came within your province once.\a148\a147How was that?\a148\a147It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known Curzon Street money-lender, on Newmarket Heath. He nearly killed the man.\a148\a147Ah, he sounds interesting! Does he often indulge in that way?\a148\a147Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. He is about the most daredevil rider in England\a151 second in the Grand National a few years back. He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. He should have been a buck in the days of the Regency\a151 a boxer, an athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all account, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back again.\a148\a147Capital, Watson! A thumb-nail sketch. I seem to know the man. Now, can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?\a148\a147Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.\a148\a147And the head trainer,\a148 said Holmes, \a147is John Mason. You need not look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him which I am unfolding. But let us have some more about Shoscombe. I seem to have struck a rich vein.\a148\a147There are the Shoscombe spaniels,\a148 said I. \a147You hear of them at every dog show. The most exclusive breed in England. They are the special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.\a148\a147Sir Robert Norberton\a146s wife, I presume!\a148\a147Sir Robert has never married. Just as well, I think, considering his prospects. He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.\a148\a147You mean that she lives with him?\a148\a147No, no. The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James. Norberton has no claim on it at all. It is only a life interest and reverts to her husband\a146s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents every year.\a148\a147And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?\a148\a147That is about the size of it. He is a devil of a fellow and must lead her a most uneasy life. Yet I have heard that she is devoted to him. But what is amiss at Shoscombe?\a148\a147Ah, that is just what I want to know. And here, I expect, is the man who can tell us.\a148The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many of both under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had waved him.\a147You had my note, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Yes, but it explained nothing.\a148\a147It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And too complicated. It was only face to face I could do it.\a148\a147Well, we are at your disposal.\a148\a147First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has gone mad.\a148Holmes raised his eyebrows. \a147This is Baker Street, not Harley Street,\a148 said he. \a147But why do you say so?\a148\a147Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things, there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby have turned his brain.\a148\a147That is a colt you are running?\a148\a147The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does. Now, I\a146ll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that it won\a146t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to win this Derby. He\a146s up to the neck, and it\a146s his last chance. Everything he could raise or borrow is on the horse\a151 and at fine odds, too! You can get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.\a148\a147But how is that if the horse is so good?\a148\a147The public don\a146t know how good he is. Sir Robert has been too clever for the touts. He has the Prince\a146s half-brother out for spins. You can\a146t tell \a146em apart. But there are two lengths in a furlong between them when it comes to a gallop. He thinks of nothing but the horse and the race. His whole life is on it. He\a146s holding off the Jews till then. If the Prince fails him he is done.\a148\a147It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come in?\a148\a147Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. I don\a146t believe he sleeps at night. He is down at the stables at all hours. His eyes are wild. It has all been too much for his nerves. Then there is his conduct to Lady Beatrice!\a148\a147Ah! What is that?\a148\a147They have always been the best of friends. They had the same tastes, the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. Every day at the same hour she would drive down to see them\a151 and, above all, she loved the Prince. He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get his lump of sugar. But that\a146s all over now.\a148\a147Why?\a148\a147Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. For a week now she has driven past the stables with never so much as \a145Good-morning\a146! \a148\a147You think there has been a quarrel?\a148\a147And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. Why else would he give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? He gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green Dragon, three miles off, at Crendall.\a148\a147That certainly did seem strange.\a148\a147Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn\a146t expect that she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in her room. He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good friend to him. But that\a146s all over, too. He never goes near her. And she takes it to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr. Holmes\a151 drinking like a fish.\a148\a147Did she drink before this estrangement?\a148\a147Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It\a146s all changed, Mr. Holmes, and there is something damned rotten about it. But then, again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night? And who is the man that meets him there?\a148Holmes rubbed his hands.\a147Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting.\a148\a147It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o\a146clock at night and raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough, master was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. He\a146s a terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all light. It was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a man waiting for him there.\a148\a147What is this haunted crypt?\a148\a147Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. It is so old that nobody could fix its date. And under it there\a146s a crypt which has a bad name among us. It\a146s a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. But master\a146s not afraid. He never feared anything in his life. But what is he doing there in the night-time?\a148\a147Wait a bit!\a148 said Holmes. \a147You say there is another man there. It must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house! Surely you have only to spot who it is and question him?\a148\a147It\a146s no one I know.\a148\a147How can you say that?\a148\a147Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night. Sir Robert turned and passed us\a151 me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. But we could hear the other moving about behind. We were not afraid of him. So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and innocent as you please. \a145Hullo, mate! who may you be?\a146 says I. I guess he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. He could run!I\a146ll give him that. In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and who he was, or what he was, we never found.\a148\a147But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?\a148\a147Yes, I would swear to his yellow face\a151 a mean dog, I should say. What could he have in common with Sir Robert?\a148Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.\a147Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?\a148 he asked at last.\a147There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been with her this five years.\a148\a147And is, no doubt, devoted?\a148Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.\a147She\a146s devoted enough,\a148 he answered at last. \a147But I won\a146t say to whom.\a148\a147Ah!\a148 said Holmes.\a147I can\a146t tell tales out of school.\a148\a147I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear enough. From Dr. Watson\a146s description of Sir Robert I can realize that no woman is safe from him. Don\a146t you think the quarrel between brother and sister may lie there?\a148\a147Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.\a148\a147But she may not have seen it before. Let us suppose that she has suddenly found it out. She wants to get rid of the woman. Her brother will not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to get about, has no means of enforcing her will. The hated maid is still tied to her. The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. Sir Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. Does not all this hang together?\a148\a147Well, it might do\a151 so far as it goes.\a148\a147Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that bear upon the visits by night to the old crypt? We can\a146t fit that into our plot.\a148\a147No, sir, and there is something more that I can\a146t fit in. Why should Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?\a148Holmes sat up abruptly.\a147We only found it out yesterday\a151 after I had written to you. Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down to the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit of a human body.\a148\a147You informed the police, I suppose?\a148Our visitor smiled grimly.\a147Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. It was just the head and a few bones of a mummy. It may have been a thousand years old. But it wasn\a146t there before. That I\a146ll swear, and so will Stephens. It had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that corner had always been empty before.\a148\a147What did you do with it?\a148\a147Well, we just left it there.\a148\a147That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. Has he returned?\a148\a147We expect him back to-day.\a148\a147When did Sir Robert give away his sister\a146s dog?\a148\a147It was just a week ago to-day. The creature was howling outside the old wellhouse, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning. He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it. Then he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at the Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again.\a148Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest and foulest of his pipes.\a147I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr. Mason,\a148 he said at last. \a147Can\a146t you make it more definite?\a148\a147Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said our visitor.He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he exposed a charred fragment of bone.Holmes examined it with interest.\a147Where did you get it?\a148\a147There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady Beatrice\a146s room. It\a146s been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained of cold and had it on again.Harvey runs it\a151 he\a146s one of my lads. This very morning he came to me with this which he found raking out the cinders. He didn\a146t like the look of it.\a148\a147Nor do I,\a148 said Holmes. \a147What do you make of it, Watson?\a148It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to its anatomical significance.\a147It\a146s the upper condyle of a human femur,\a148 said I.\a147Exactly!\a148 Holmes had become very serious. \a147When does this lad tend to the furnace?\a148\a147He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.\a148\a147Then anyone could visit it during the night?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Can you enter it from outside?\a148\a147There is one door from outside. There is another which leads up by a stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice\a146s room is situated.\a148\a147These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty. You say that Sir Robert was not at home last night?\a148\a147No, sir.\a148\a147Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.\a148\a147That\a146s true, sir.\a148\a147What is the name of that inn you spoke of?\a148\a147The Green Dragon.\a148\a147Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?\a148 The honest trainer showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another lunatic had come into his harassed life.\a147Well, sir, I\a146ve heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike in the Hall lake.\a148\a147That\a146s good enough. Watson and I are famous fishermen\a151 are we not, Watson? You may address us in future at the Green Dragon. We should reach it to-night. I need not say that we don\a146t want to see you, Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I want you. When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will let you have a considered opinion.\a148Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little \a147halt-on-demand\a148 station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was covered with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.\a147What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?\a148 said Holmes.The face of the innkeeper clouded.\a147That wouldn\a146t do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the lake before you were through.\a148\a147How\a146s that, then?\a148\a147It\a146s Sir Robert, sir. He\a146s terrible jealous of touts. If you two strangers were as near his training quarters as that he\a146d be after you as sure as fate. He ain\a146t taking no chances, Sir Robert ain\a146t.\a148\a147I\a146ve heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.\a148\a147Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all our money for the race, and all Sir Robert\a146s into the bargain. By the way\a148he looked at us with thoughtful eyes\a147I suppose you ain\a146t on the turf yourselves?\a148\a147No, indeed. Just two weary Londoners who badly need some good Berkshire air.\a148\a147Well, you are in the right place for that. There is a deal of it lying about. But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. He\a146s the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the park.\a148\a147Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the way, that was a most beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.\a148\a147I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There ain\a146t a better in England.\a148\a147I am a dog-fancier myself,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Now, if it is a fair question, what would a prize dog like that cost?\a148\a147More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me this one. That\a146s why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.\a148\a147We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,\a148 said Holmes when the landlord had left us. \a147It\a146s not an easy one to play, but we may see our way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still in London, I hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should like reassurance.\a148\a147Have you any theory, Holmes?\a148\a147Only this, Watson, that \isomething\i happened a week or so ago which has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is that something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They seem to be of a curiously mixed character. But that should surely help us. It is only the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.\a147Let us consider our data. The brother no longer visits the beloved invalid sister. He gives away her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does that suggest nothing to you?\a148\a147Nothing but the brother\a146s spite.\a148\a147Well, it might be so. Or\a151 well, there is an alternative. Now to continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if there is a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, alters her habits, is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at the stables to greet her favourite horse and apparently takes to drink. That covers the case, does it not?\a148\a147Save for the business in the crypt.\a148\a147That is another line of thought. There are two, and I beg you will not tangle them. Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely sinister flavour, has it not?\a148\a147I can make nothing of it.\a148\a147Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. He is mad keen upon winning the Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors. He is a daring and desperate man. He derives his income from his sister. His sister\a146s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to be on fairly safe ground, do we not?\a148\a147But the crypt?\a148\a147Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson\a151 it is merely a scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument\a146s sake\a151 that Sir Robert has done away with his sister.\a148\a147My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.\a148\a147Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock. But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for a moment argue upon this supposition. He could not fly the country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he has still to stand his ground. To do this he would have to dispose of the body of his victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would impersonate her. With the maid as his confidante that would not be impossible. The woman\a146s body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen. What say you to that, Watson?\a148\a147Well, it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous supposition.\a148\a147I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow, Watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. We may chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process.\a148In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. About eleven o\a146clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the black spaniel with us.\a147This is the place,\a148 said he as we came to two high park gates with heraldic griffins towering above them. \a147About midday, Mr Barnes informs me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while the gates are opened. When it comes through, and before it gathers speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some question. Never mind me. I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see what I can see.\a148It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid, high-stepping grey carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched behind his bush with the dog. I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane in the roadway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was able to get a good look at the occupants. A highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and impudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an elderly person with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which proclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the highroad I held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. With a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step. Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it snapped at the black skirt above it.\a147Drive on! Drive on!\a148 shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the horses, and we were left standing in the roadway.\a147Well, Watson, that\a146s done it,\a148 said Holmes as he fastened the lead to the neck of the excited spaniel. \a147He thought it was his mistress, and he found it was a stranger. Dogs don\a146t make mistakes.\a148\a147But it was the voice of a man!\a148 I cried.\a147Exactly! We have added one card to our hand, Watson, but it needs careful playing, all the same.\a148My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream with the result that we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was only after that meal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. Once more we found ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our London acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.\a147Good-evening, gentlemen,\a148 said he. \a147I got your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected to-night.\a148\a147How far is this crypt from the house?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147A good quarter of a mile.\a148\a147Then I think we can disregard him altogether.\a148\a147I can\a146t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The moment he arrives he will want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.\a148\a147I see! In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason. You can show us the crypt and then leave us.\a148It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the grass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to be the ancient chapel. We entered the broken gap which was once the porch, and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the crypt. Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy place\a151 dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to the gate of Death.\a147You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could you show them before you go?\a148\a147They are here in this corner.\a148 The trainer strode across and then stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. \a147They are gone,\a148 said he.\a147So I expected,\a148 said Holmes, chuckling. \a147I fancy the ashes of them might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a part.\a148\a147But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man who has been dead a thousand years?\a148 asked John Mason.\a147That is what we are here to find out,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It may mean a long search, and we need not detain you. I fancy that we shall get our solution before morning.\a148When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman Hugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the eighteenth century. It was an hour or more before Holmes came to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. I heard his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. With his lens he was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink, levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a couple of clamps. There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had an unforeseen interruption.Someone was walking in the chapel above. It was the firm, rapid step of one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon which he walked. A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terrible figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. A large stable-lantern which he held in front of him shone upward upon a strong, heavily moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my companion and myself.\a147Who the devil are you?\a148 he thundered. \a147And what are you doing upon my property?\a148 Then, as Holmes returned no answer he took a couple of steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. \a147Do you hear me?\a148 he cried. \a147Who are you? What are you doing here?\a148 His cudgel quivered in the air.But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to meet him.\a147I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,\a148 he said in his sternest tone. \a147Who is this? And what is it doing here?\a148He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. In the glare of the lantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot with dreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end, the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face.The baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself against a stone sarcophagus.\a147How came you to know of this?\a148 he cried. And then, with some return of his truculent manner: \a147What business is it of yours?\a148\a147My name is Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said my companion. \a147 Possibly it is familiar to you. In any case, my business is that of every other good citizen\a151 to uphold the law. It seems to me that you have much to answer for.\a148Sir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes\a146s quiet voice and cool, assured manner had their effect.\a147\a160\a145Fore God, Mr. Holmes, it\a146s all right,\a148 said he. \a147 Appearances are against me, I\a146ll admit, but I could act no otherwise.\a148\a147I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be before the police.\a148Sir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders.\a147Well, if it must be, it must. Come up to the house and you can judge for yourself how the matter stands.\a148A quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of the old house. It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left us for a few moments. When he returned he had two companions with him; the one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the other, a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. These two wore an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the baronet had not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken.\a147There,\a148 said Sir Robert with a wave of his hand, \a147are Mr. and Mrs. Norlett. Mrs. Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some years been my sister\a146s confidential maid. I have brought them here because I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I say.\a148\a147Is this necessary, Sir Robert? Have you thought what you are doing?\a148 cried the woman.\a147As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,\a148 said her husband.Sir Robert gave him a glance of contempt. \a147I will take all responsibility,\a148 said he. \a147Now, Mr. Holmes, listen to a plain statement of the facts.\a147You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not have found you where I did. Therefore, you know already, in all probability, that I am running a dark horse for the Derby and that everything depends upon my success. If I win, all is easy. If I lose\a151 well, I dare not think of that!\a148\a147I understand the position,\a148 said Holmes.\a147I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything. But it is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only. For myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews. I have always known that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like a flock of vultures. Everything would be seized\a151 my stables, my horses\a151 everything. Well, Mr. Holmes, my sister \idid\i die just a week ago.\a148\a147And you told no one!\a148\a147What could I do? Absolute ruin faced me. If I could stave things off for three weeks all would be well. Her maid\a146s husband\a151 this man here\a151 is an actor. It came into our heads\a151 it came into my head\a151 that he could for that short period personate my sister. It was but a case of appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the maid. It was not difficult to arrange. My sister died of the dropsy which had long afflicted her.\a148\a147That will be for a coroner to decide.\a148\a147Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have threatened such an end.\a148\a147Well, what did you do?\a148\a147The body could not remain there. On the first night Norlett and I carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. We were followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the door, so I felt some safer place was needed. I got rid of the spaniel, and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. There was no indignity or irreverence, Mr. Holmes. I do not feel that I have wronged the dead.\a148\a147Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.\a148The baronet shook his head impatiently. \a147It is easy to preach,\a148 said he. \a147Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my position. One cannot see all one\a146s hopes and all one\a146s plans shattered at the last moment and make no effort to save them. It seemed to me that it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one of the coffins of her husband\a146s ancestors lying in what is still consecrated ground. We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and placed her as you have seen her. As to the old relics which we took out, we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. Norlett and I removed them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace. There is my story, Mr. Holmes, though how you forced my hand so that I have to tell it is more than I can say.\a148Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.\a147There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,\a148 he said at last. \a147Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would hold good even if your creditors seized your estate.\a148\a147The horse would be part of the estate. What do they care for my bets? As likely as not they would not run him at all. My chief creditor is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy\a151 a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer, whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath. Do you suppose that he would try to save me?\a148\a147Well, Sir Robert,\a148 said Holmes, rising, \a147this matter must, of course, be referred to the police. It was my duty to bring the facts to light, and there I must leave it. As to the morality or decency of your conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. It is nearly midnight, Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble abode.\a148It is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a happier note than Sir Robert\a146s actions deserved. Shoscombe Prince did win the Derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over, when they were paid in full, and enough was left to reestablish Sir Robert in a fair position in life. Both police and coroner took a lenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay in registering the lady\a146s decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age.\p\X1\BSir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\X1Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in Edinburgh and sent to the Jesuit preparatory school Stonyhurst at the age of nine, and by the time he left the school in 1875 he rejected Christianity to become an agnostic. From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at Edinburgh University, including a period working in the town of Aston (now a district of Birmingham). Following his term at University he served as a ship\a146s doctor on a voyage to the West African coast, and then in 1882 he set up a practice in Plymouth. He won his doctorate in 1885. His medical practice was unsuccessful; while waiting for patients he began writing stories. His first literary experience came in Chambers\a146s Edinburgh Journal before he was twenty.It was only after he subsequently moved his practice to Southsea that he began to indulge more extensively in literature. His first significant work was A Study in Scarlet which appeared in Beeton\a146s Christmas Annual for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes.In 1885 he married Louise Hawkins, who suffered from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1906. He married Miss Jean Leckie in 1907, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897 but had maintained a platonic relationship with out of loyalty to his first wife. Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (Mary and Kingsley), and three with his second wife (Jean, Denis, and Adrian).In 1890 Doyle studied the eye in Vienna, and in 1891 moved to London to set up a practice as an oculist. This also gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: \a147I think of slaying Holmes\a133 and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.\a148 In December 1893 he did so, with Holmes and his arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty apparently plunging to their deaths together over a waterfall in the story \a147The Final Problem\a148. Public outcry led him to bring the character back. Doyle returned to the story in \a147The Adventure of the Empty House\a148, saying that only Moriarty had fallen, but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had arranged to be temporarily \a147dead\a148 also. Holmes eventually appeared in 56 short stories and four of Doyle\a146s novels (he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors, as well).Following the Boer War in South Africa at the turn of the century and the condemnation from around the world over Britain\a146s conduct, Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct which was widely translated. Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted and appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey in 1902. He also wrote the longer book The Great Boer War in 1900. During the early years of the twentieth century Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a Liberal Unionist, once in Edinburgh and once in the Border Burghs, but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected. He did, however, become one of the first Honorary Members of the Ski Club of Great Britain.Conan Doyle was involved even in the campaign for the reform of the Congo Free State, lead by the journalist Edmund Dene Morel and the diplomat Roger Casement. He wrote The Crime of the Congo in 1908, a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in Congo. He become acquainted with Morel and Casement, taking even inspiration by them for two of the main character of the novel The Lost World (1912). He broke with both, however, with the first world war, when Morel (who was rather left-wing) became one of the leaders of the pacifist movement and Casement betrayed England for his Irish nationalistic views. He, however, tried to save Casement from death penalty, arguing that he had driven mad and was not responsible of his act.Doyle also caused two cases to be reopened. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji, who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were dead set on Edalji\a146s guilt, even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed. It was partially as a result of this case that the Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907, so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped to establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice. The second case, that of Oscar Slater, a German Jew and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in 1908 excited Doyle\a146s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed. It is not known whether either enjoyed the same resolution as Holmes\a146 clients.In his later years, Doyle became involved with Spiritualism, to the extent that he wrote a Professor Challenger novel on the subject, The Land of Mist. One of the odder aspects of this involvement was his book The Coming of the Fairies (1921): He was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the Cottingley fairy photographs, which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 under the pretence of occultism.\p\X1\BSources & Acknowledgements\B\X1I would like to thank Olivia Adler for permission to use the excellent images from the Pinacotheca Holmesiana website within each book.The text is mostly from the University of Adelaide\a146s Open Sources with Project Gutenburg sources used for reference.The text of the Arthur Conan Doyle biography is from Wikipedia.
