I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\a151 excellent for drawing the veil from men\a146s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.I had seen little of Holmes since the singular chain of events which I have already narrated in a bold fashion under the heading of \iThe Sign of Four\i. My marriage had, as he foretold, drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.One night\a151 it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\a151 I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\a147Wedlock suits you,\a148 he remarked. \a147I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\a148\a147Seven!\a148 I answered.\a147Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\a148\a147Then, how do you know?\a148\a147I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\a148\a147My dear Holmes,\a148 said I, \a147this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\a146t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\a148He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\a147It is simplicity itself,\a148 said he; \a147my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\a148I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \a147When I hear you give your reasons,\a148 I remarked, \a147the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\a148\a147Quite so,\a148 he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \a147You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\a148\a147Frequently.\a148\a147How often?\a148\a147Well, some hundreds of times.\a148\a147Then how many are there?\a148\a147How many? I don\a146t know.\a148\a147Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\a148 He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. \a147It came by the last post,\a148 said he. \a147Read it aloud.\a148The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\a147There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\a146clock,\a148 it said, \a147a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\a148\a147This is indeed a mystery,\a148 I remarked. \a147What do you imagine that it means?\a148\a147I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\a148I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\a147The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\a148 I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\a146s processes. \a147Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\a148\a147Peculiar\a151 that is the very word,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\a148I did so, and saw a large \iE\i with a small \ig\i, a \iP\i, and a large \iG\i with a small \it\i woven into the texture of the paper.\a147What do you make of that?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\a148\a147Not at all. The \iG\i with the small \it\i stands for \a145Gesellschaft,\a146 which is the German for \a145Company.\a146 It is a customary contraction like our \a145Co.\a146 \iP\i, of course, stands for \a145Papier.\a146 Now for the \a145\iEg\i. Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\a148 He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \a147Eglow, Eglonitz\a151 here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country\a151 in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \a145Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\a146 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\a148 His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\a147The paper was made in Bohemia,\a148 I said.\a147Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence\a151\a145This account of you we have from all quarters received.\a146 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\a148As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\a146 hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\a147A pair, by the sound,\a148 said he. \a147Yes,\a148 he continued, glancing out of the window. \a147A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\a146s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\a148\a147I think that I had better go, Holmes.\a148\a147Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\a148\a147But your client\a151\a148\a147Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\a148A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.\a147Come in!\a148 said Holmes.A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\a147You had my note?\a148 he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \a147I told you that I would call.\a148 He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\a147Pray take a seat,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\a148\a147You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\a148I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \a147It is both, or none,\a148 said he. \a147You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\a148The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \a147Then I must begin,\a148 said he, \a147by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\a148\a147I promise,\a148 said Holmes.\a147And I.\a148\a147You will excuse this mask,\a148 continued our strange visitor. \a147The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\a148\a147I was aware of it,\a148 said Holmes dryly.\a147The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\a148\a147I was also aware of that,\a148 murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\a147If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\a148 he remarked, \a147I should be better able to advise you.\a148The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \a147You are right,\a148 he cried; \a147I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\a148\a147Why, indeed?\a148 murmured Holmes. \a147Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\a148\a147But you can understand,\a148 said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \a147you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come \iincognito\i from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\a148\a147Then, pray consult,\a148 said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\a147The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\a148\a147Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\a148 murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\a147Let me see!\a148 said Holmes. \a147Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto\a151 hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\a151 yes! Retired from operatic stage\a151 ha! Living in London\a151 quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\a148\a147Precisely so. But how\a151\a148\a147Was there a secret marriage?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147No legal papers or certificates?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\a148\a147There is the writing.\a148\a147Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\a148\a147My private note-paper.\a148\a147Stolen.\a148\a147My own seal.\a148\a147Imitated.\a148\a147My photograph.\a148\a147Bought.\a148\a147We were both in the photograph.\a148\a147Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\a148\a147I was mad\a151 insane.\a148\a147You have compromised yourself seriously.\a148\a147I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\a148\a147It must be recovered.\a148\a147We have tried and failed.\a148\a147Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\a148\a147She will not sell.\a148\a147Stolen, then.\a148\a147Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\a148\a147No sign of it?\a148\a147Absolutely none.\a148Holmes laughed. \a147It is quite a pretty little problem,\a148 said he.\a147But a very serious one to me,\a148 returned the King reproachfully.\a147Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\a148\a147To ruin me.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147I am about to be married.\a148\a147So I have heard.\a148\a147To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\a148\a147And Irene Adler?\a148\a147Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go\a151 none.\a148\a147You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\a148\a147I am sure.\a148\a147And why?\a148\a147Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\a148\a147Oh, then we have three days yet,\a148 said Holmes with a yawn. \a147That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\a148\a147Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\a148\a147Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\a148\a147Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\a148\a147Then, as to money?\a148\a147You have \icarte blanche\i.\a148\a147Absolutely?\a148\a147I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\a148\a147And for present expenses?\a148The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\a147There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\a148 he said.Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\a147And Mademoiselle\a146s address?\a148 he asked.\a147Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\a146s Wood.\a148Holmes took a note of it. \a147One other question,\a148 said he. \a147Was the photograph a cabinet?\a148\a147It was.\a148\a147Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\a148 he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \a147If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\a146clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\a148At three o\a146clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\a146clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\a146s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\a147Well, really!\a148 he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\a147What is it?\a148\a147It\a146s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\a148\a147I can\a146t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\a148\a147Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\a146clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a \ibijou\i villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\a147I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\a148\a147And what of Irene Adler?\a148 I asked.\a147Oh, she has turned all the men\a146s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\a147This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\a146s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\a148\a147I am following you closely,\a148 I answered.\a147I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\a151 evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\a147He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \a145Drive like the devil,\a146 he shouted, \a145first to Gross & Hankey\a146s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\a146\a147Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\a146t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\a147\a160\a145The Church of St. Monica, John,\a146 she cried, \a145and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\a146\a147This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \a145The Church of St. Monica,\a146 said I, \a145and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\a146 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\a147My cabby drove fast. I don\a146t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\a147\a160\a145Thank God,\a146 he cried. \a145You\a146ll do. Come! Come!\a146\a147\a160\a145What then?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\a146t be legal.\a146\a147I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\a148\a147This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\a148 said I; \a147and what then?\a148\a147Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \a145I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\a146 she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\a148\a147Which are?\a148\a147Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\a148 he answered, ringing the bell. \a147I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\a148\a147I shall be delighted.\a148\a147You don\a146t mind breaking the law?\a148\a147Not in the least.\a148\a147Nor running a chance of arrest?\a148\a147Not in a good cause.\a148\a147Oh, the cause is excellent!\a148\a147Then I am your man.\a148\a147I was sure that I might rely on you.\a148\a147But what is it you wish?\a148\a147When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\a148 he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \a147I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\a148\a147And what then?\a148\a147You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\a148\a147I am to be neutral?\a148\a147To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147And when I raise my hand\a151 so\a151 you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\a148\a147Entirely.\a148\a147It is nothing very formidable,\a148 he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \a147It is an ordinary plumber\a146s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\a148\a147I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147Then you may entirely rely on me.\a148\a147That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new \ir\a244le\i I have to play.\a148He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\a146 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\a147You see,\a148 remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \a147this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\a148\a147Where, indeed?\a148\a147It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\a146s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\a148\a147Where, then?\a148\a147Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\a148\a147But it has twice been burgled.\a148\a147Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\a148\a147But how will you look?\a148\a147I will not look.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147I will get her to show me.\a148\a147But she will refuse.\a148\a147She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\a148As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\a147Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\a148 she asked.\a147He is dead,\a148 cried several voices.\a147No, no, there\a146s life in him!\a148 shouted another. \a147But he\a146ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\a148\a147He\a146s a brave fellow,\a148 said a woman. \a147They would have had the lady\a146s purse and watch if it hadn\a146t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\a146s breathing now.\a148\a147He can\a146t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\a148\a147Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\a148Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had entrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \a147Fire!\a148 The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill\a151 gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids\a151 joined in a general shriek of \a147Fire!\a148 Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\a146s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\a147You did it very nicely, Doctor,\a148 he remarked. \a147Nothing could have been better. It is all right.\a148\a147You have the photograph?\a148\a147I know where it is.\a148\a147And how did you find out?\a148\a147She showed me, as I told you she would.\a148\a147I am still in the dark.\a148\a147I do not wish to make a mystery,\a148 said he, laughing. \a147The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\a148\a147I guessed as much.\a148\a147Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\a148\a147That also I could fathom.\a148\a147Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\a148\a147How did that help you?\a148\a147It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\a148\a147And now?\a148 I asked.\a147Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\a148\a147And when will you call?\a148\a147At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\a148We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\a147Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\a148There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\a147I\a146ve heard that voice before,\a148 said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \a147Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\a148I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\a147You have really got it!\a148 he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\a147Not yet.\a148\a147But you have hopes?\a148\a147I have hopes.\a148\a147Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\a148\a147We must have a cab.\a148\a147No, my brougham is waiting.\a148\a147Then that will simplify matters.\a148 We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\a147Irene Adler is married,\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147Married! When?\a148\a147Yesterday.\a148\a147But to whom?\a148\a147To an English lawyer named Norton.\a148\a147But she could not love him.\a148\a147I am in hopes that she does.\a148\a147And why in hopes?\a148\a147Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\a146s plan.\a148\a147It is true. And yet\a151 Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\a148 He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\a147Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\a148 said she.\a147I am Mr. Holmes,\a148 answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\a147Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\a148\a147What!\a148 Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \a147Do you mean that she has left England?\a148\a147Never to return.\a148\a147And the papers?\a148 asked the King hoarsely. \a147All is lost.\a148\a147We shall see.\a148 He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \a147Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\a148 My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\a147MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\a151 You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\a147Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\a147We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Very truly yours,IRENE NORTON, \in\a233e\i ADLER.\a148\a147What a woman\a151 oh, what a woman!\a148 cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \a147Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\a148\a147From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\a148 said Holmes coldly. \a147I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\a146s business to a more successful conclusion.\a148\a147On the contrary, my dear sir,\a148 cried the King; \a147nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\a148\a147I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\a148\a147I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring\a151\a148 He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\a147Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\a148 said Holmes.\a147You have but to name it.\a148\a147This photograph!\a148The King stared at him in amazement.\a147Irene\a146s photograph!\a148 he cried. \a147Certainly, if you wish it.\a148\a147I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\a148 He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\a146s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of \ithe\i woman.\p\BAdventure II\B - \X1\BThe Red-Headed League\B\X1\c\i\m="REDH-09.png"\i\cI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\a147You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\a148 he said cordially.\a147I was afraid that you were engaged.\a148\a147So I am. Very much so.\a148\a147Then I can wait in the next room.\a148\a147Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\a148The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\a147Try the settee,\a148 said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \a147I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\a148\a147Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\a148 I observed.\a147You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\a148\a147A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\a148\a147You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\a148The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\a146s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.Sherlock Holmes\a146 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \a147Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\a148Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\a147How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\a148 he asked. \a147How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\a146s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\a146s carpenter.\a148\a147Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\a148\a147Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\a148\a147I won\a146t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\a148\a147Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\a148\a147What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\a148\a147Well, but China?\a148\a147The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\a146 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\a148Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \a147Well, I never!\a148 said he. \a147I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.\a148\a147I begin to think, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that I make a mistake in explaining. \a145Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\a146 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\a148\a147Yes, I have got it now,\a148 he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \a147Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\a148I took the paper from him and read as follows:\a147TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\a146clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\a146s Court, Fleet Street.\a148\a147What on earth does this mean?\a148 I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \a147It is a little off the beaten track, isn\a146t it?\a148 said he. \a147And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\a148\a147It is \iThe Morning Chronicle\i of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\a148\a147Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\a148\a147Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \a147I have a small pawnbroker\a146s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\a146s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\a148\a147What is the name of this obliging youth?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes.\a147His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\a146s not such a youth, either. It\a146s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\a148\a147Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ\a187 who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\a146t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\a148\a147Oh, he has his faults, too,\a148 said Mr. Wilson. \a147Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\a146s a good worker. There\a146s no vice in him.\a148\a147He is still with you, I presume?\a148\a147Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\a151 that\a146s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\a147The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:\a147\a160\a145I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why that?\a146 I asks. \a147\a160\a145Why,\a146 says he, \a145here\a146s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\a146s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\a146 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\a146s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why, what is it, then?\a146 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\a146t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\a147\a160\a145Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\a146 he asked with his eyes open.\a147\a160\a145Never.\a146\a147\a160\a145Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\a146\a147\a160\a145And what are they worth?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\a146s other occupations.\a146\a147Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\a147\a160\a145Tell me all about it,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said he, showing me the advertisement, \a145you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145But,\a146 said I, \a145there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\a146\a147\a160\a145Not so many as you might think,\a146 he answered. \a145You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\a146\a147Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\a147I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\a146s Court looked like a coster\a146s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\a151 straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\a148\a147Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\a148 remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \a147Pray continue your very interesting statement.\a148\a147There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\a147\a160\a145This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\a146 said my assistant, \a145and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\a146\a147\a160\a145And he is admirably suited for it,\a146 the other answered. \a145He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\a146 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\a147\a160\a145It would be injustice to hesitate,\a146 said he. \a145You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\a146 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \a145There is water in your eyes,\a146 said he as he released me. \a145I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\a146s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\a146 He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\a147\a160\a145My name,\a146 said he, \a145is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\a146\a147I answered that I had not.\a147His face fell immediately.\a147\a160\a145Dear me!\a146 he said gravely, \a145that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\a146\a147My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\a147\a160\a145In the case of another,\a146 said he, \a145the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\a146 said Vincent Spaulding. \a145I should be able to look after that for you.\a146\a147\a160\a145What would be the hours?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Ten to two.\a146\a147Now a pawnbroker\a146s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\a147\a160\a145That would suit me very well,\a146 said I. \a145And the pay?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is 4 pounds a week.\a146\a147\a160\a145And the work?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is purely nominal.\a146\a147\a160\a145What do you call purely nominal?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\a146t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\a146\a147\a160\a145It\a146s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145No excuse will avail,\a146 said Mr. Duncan Ross; \a145neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\a146\a147\a160\a145And the work?\a146\a147\a160\a145Is to copy out the \iEncyclopaedia Britannica\i. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly,\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\a146 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\a147Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the \a145Encyclopaedia Britannica.\a146 Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\a146s Court.\a147Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\a146clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\a147This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\a146s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\a147Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\a146s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\a148\a147To an end?\a148\a147Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\a146clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\a148 He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:\c\iTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\i\c\c\iIS\i\c\c\iDISSOLVED.\i\c\c\iOctober 9, 1890.\i\cSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\a147I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\a148 cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \a147If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\a148\a147No, no,\a148 cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \a147I really wouldn\a146t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\a148\a147I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said I, \a145the gentleman at No. 4.\a146\a147\a160\a145What, the red-headed man?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh,\a146 said he, \a145his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where could I find him?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\a146s.\a146\a147I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\a148\a147And what did you do then?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\a148\a147And you did very wisely,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\a148\a147Grave enough!\a148 said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \a147Why, I have lost four pound a week.\a148\a147As far as you are personally concerned,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\a148\a147No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank\a151 if it was a prank\a151 upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\a148\a147We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement\a151 how long had he been with you?\a148\a147About a month then.\a148\a147How did he come?\a148\a147In answer to an advertisement.\a148\a147Was he the only applicant?\a148\a147No, I had a dozen.\a148\a147Why did you pick him?\a148\a147Because he was handy and would come cheap.\a148\a147At half-wages, in fact.\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\a148\a147Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\a146s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\a148Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \a147I thought as much,\a148 said he. \a147Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\a148\a147Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\a148\a147Hum!\a148 said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \a147He is still with you?\a148\a147Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\a148\a147And has your business been attended to in your absence?\a148\a147Nothing to complain of, sir. There\a146s never very much to do of a morning.\a148\a147That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\a148\a147Well, Watson,\a148 said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \a147what do you make of it all?\a148\a147I make nothing of it,\a148 I answered frankly. \a147It is a most mysterious business.\a148\a147As a rule,\a148 said Holmes, \a147the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\a148\a147What are you going to do, then?\a148 I asked.\a147To smoke,\a148 he answered. \a147It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\a146t speak to me for fifty minutes.\a148 He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\a147Sarasate plays at the St. James\a146s Hall this afternoon,\a148 he remarked. \a147What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\a148\a147I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\a148\a147Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\a148We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \a147JABEZ WILSON\a148 in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\a146s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\a147Thank you,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\a148\a147Third right, fourth left,\a148 answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\a147Smart fellow, that,\a148 observed Holmes as we walked away. \a147He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\a148\a147Evidently,\a148 said I, \a147Mr. Wilson\a146s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\a148\a147Not him.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147The knees of his trousers.\a148\a147And what did you see?\a148\a147What I expected to see.\a148\a147Why did you beat the pavement?\a148\a147My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\a146s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\a148The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\a147Let me see,\a148 said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \a147I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\a146s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\a146s carriage-building \idep\a244t\i. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\a146ve done our work, so it\a146s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\a148My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\a146s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\a147You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\a148 he remarked as we emerged.\a147Yes, it would be as well.\a148\a147And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\a148\a147Why serious?\a148\a147A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\a148\a147At what time?\a148\a147Ten will be early enough.\a148\a147I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\a148\a147Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\a148 He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \a147Encyclopaedia\a148 down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\a146s assistant was a formidable man\a151 a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\a147Ha! Our party is complete,\a148 said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \a147Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\a146s adventure.\a148\a147We\a146re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\a148 said Jones in his consequential way. \a147Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\a148\a147I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\a148 observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\a147You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\a148 said the police agent loftily. \a147He has his own little methods, which are, if he won\a146t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\a148\a147Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\a148 said the stranger with deference. \a147Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\a148\a147I think you will find,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, \a147that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\a148\a147John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\a146s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\a146s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\a146ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\a146ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\a148\a147I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\a146ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\a148Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\a147We are close there now,\a148 my friend remarked. \a147This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\a148We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\a147You are not very vulnerable from above,\a148 Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\a147Nor from below,\a148 said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \a147Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\a148 he remarked, looking up in surprise.\a147I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\a148 said Holmes severely. \a147You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\a148The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\a147We have at least an hour before us,\a148 he remarked, \a147for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor\a151 as no doubt you have divined\a151 in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\a148\a147It is our French gold,\a148 whispered the director. \a147We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\a148\a147Your French gold?\a148\a147Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\a148\a147Which were very well justified,\a148 observed Holmes. \a147And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\a148\a147And sit in the dark?\a148\a147I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a \ipartie carr\a233e\i, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\a146s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\a148I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness\a151 such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\a146s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\a147They have but one retreat,\a148 whispered Holmes. \a147That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\a148\a147I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\a148\a147Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\a148What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\a147It\a146s all clear,\a148 he whispered. \a147Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\a146ll swing for it!\a148Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\a146 hunting crop came down on the man\a146s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\a147It\a146s no use, John Clay,\a148 said Holmes blandly. \a147You have no chance at all.\a148\a147So I see,\a148 the other answered with the utmost coolness. \a147I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\a148\a147There are three men waiting for him at the door,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\a148\a147And I you,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\a148\a147You\a146ll see your pal again presently,\a148 said Jones. \a147He\a146s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\a148\a147I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\a148 remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \a147You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \a145sir\a146 and \a145please.\a146\a160\a148\a147All right,\a148 said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \a147Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\a148\a147That is better,\a148 said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\a147Really, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \a147I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\a148\a147I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\a148\a147You see, Watson,\a148 he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \a147it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the \iEncyclopaedia\i, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\a146s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\a146s hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\a148\a147But how could you guess what the motive was?\a148\a147Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\a146s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\a146s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar\a151 something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\a147So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\a146s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\a148\a147And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\a148 I asked.\a147Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\a146s presence\a151 in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\a148\a147You reasoned it out beautifully,\a148 I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \a147It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\a148\a147It saved me from ennui,\a148 he answered, yawning. \a147Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\a148\a147And you are a benefactor of the race,\a148 said I.He shrugged his shoulders. \a147Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\a148 he remarked. \a147\a160\a145L\a146homme c\a146est rien\a151 l\a146oeuvre c\a146est tout,\a146 as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\a148\p\BAdventure III\B - \X2\BA Case Of Identity\B\X2\c\i\m="iden-01.png"\i\c\a147My dear fellow,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \a147life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most \ioutr\a233\i results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\a148\a147And yet I am not convinced of it,\a148 I answered. \a147The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\a148\a147A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\a148I smiled and shook my head. \a147I can quite understand your thinking so.\a148 I said. \a147Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\a148\a151 I picked up the morning paper from the ground\a151\a147let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \a145A husband\a146s cruelty to his wife.\a146 There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\a148\a147Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\a148 said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \a147This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\a148He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\a147Ah,\a148 said he, \a147I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\a148\a147And the ring?\a148 I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\a147It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\a148\a147And have you any on hand just now?\a148 I asked with interest.\a147Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\a148He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\a147I have seen those symptoms before,\a148 said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \a147Oscillation upon the pavement always means an \iaffaire du coeur\i. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\a148As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\a147Do you not find,\a148 he said, \a147that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\a148\a147I did at first,\a148 she answered, \a147but now I know where the letters are without looking.\a148 Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \a147You\a146ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\a148 she cried, \a147else how could you know all that?\a148\a147Never mind,\a148 said Holmes, laughing; \a147it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\a148\a147I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\a146m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \a147Yes, I did bang out of the house,\a148 she said, \a147for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\a151 that is, my father\a151 took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\a148\a147Your father,\a148 said Holmes, \a147your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\a148\a147Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\a148\a147And your mother is alive?\a148\a147Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\a146t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\a146s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\a146t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\a148I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\a147Your own little income,\a148 he asked, \a147does it come out of the business?\a148\a147Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\a206\a169 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\a148\a147You interest me extremely,\a148 said Holmes. \a147And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.\a148\a147I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\a146t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\a148\a147You have made your position very clear to me,\a148 said Holmes. \a147This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148A flush stole over Miss Sutherland\a146s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \a147I met him first at the gasfitters\a146 ball,\a148 she said. \a147They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\a146s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147I suppose,\a148 said Holmes, \a147that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\a148\a147Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\a148\a147I see. Then at the gasfitters\a146 ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148\a147Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him\a151 that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\a148\a147No?\a148\a147Well, you know father didn\a146t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\a146t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\a148\a147But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\a148\a147Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\a148\a147Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\a148\a147Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer\a151 Mr. Angel\a151 was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street\a151 and\a151\a148\a147What office?\a148\a147That\a146s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\a146t know.\a148\a147Where did he live, then?\a148\a147He slept on the premises.\a148\a147And you don\a146t know his address?\a148\a147No\a151 except that it was Leadenhall Street.\a148\a147Where did you address your letters, then?\a148\a147To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\a146t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\a148\a147It was most suggestive,\a148 said Holmes. \a147It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\a148\a147He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\a146d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\a148\a147Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\a148\a147Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\a146t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\a146t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\a148\a147It missed him, then?\a148\a147Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\a148\a147Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\a148\a147Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\a146s, near King\a146s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\a148\a147It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\a148\a147Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\a148\a147But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\a148\a147She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\a148\a147And your father? Did you tell him?\a148\a147Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\a146t sleep a wink at night.\a148 She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\a147I shall glance into the case for you,\a148 said Holmes, rising, \a147and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\a148\a147Then you don\a146t think I\a146ll see him again?\a148\a147I fear not.\a148\a147Then what has happened to him?\a148\a147You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\a148\a147I advertised for him in last Saturday\a146s \iChronicle\i,\a148 said she. \a147Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\a148\a147Thank you. And your address?\a148\a147No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\a148\a147Mr. Angel\a146s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\a146s place of business?\a148\a147He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\a148\a147Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\a148\a147You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\a148For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\a147Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\a148 he observed. \a147I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \a14677, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\a148\a147You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\a148 I remarked.\a147Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\a146s appearance? Describe it.\a148\a147Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\a146t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\a148Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\a147\a146Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\a146s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\a148\a147It surprised me.\a148\a147But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\a148\a147And what else?\a148 I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\a146s incisive reasoning.\a147I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\a148I held the little printed slip to the light.\a147Missing,\a148 it said, \a147on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft 7 in in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing\a151\a148\a147That will do,\a148 said Holmes. \a147As to the letters,\a148 he continued, glancing over them, \a147they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\a148\a147They are typewritten,\a148 I remarked.\a147Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \a145Hosmer Angel\a146 at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive\a151 in fact, we may call it conclusive.\a148\a147Of what?\a148\a147My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\a148\a147I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\a148\a147No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\a146s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\a146clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\a148I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\a146s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\a146clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the \id\a195\a136nouement\i of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\a147Well, have you solved it?\a148 I asked as I entered.\a147Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\a148\a147No, no, the mystery!\a148 I cried.\a147Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\a148\a147Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\a148The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\a147This is the girl\a146s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\a148 said Holmes. \a147He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\a148The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\a147Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\a148 said Holmes. \a147I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\a146clock?\a148\a147Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 said Holmes quietly; \a147I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\a148Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \a147I am delighted to hear it,\a148 he said.\a147It is a curious thing,\a148 remarked Holmes, \a147that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\a146s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \a145e,\a146 and a slight defect in the tail of the \a145r.\a146 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\a148\a147We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\a148 our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\a147And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\a148 Holmes continued. \a147I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \a145e\a146s\a146 slurred and the \a145r\a146s\a146 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\a148Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \a147I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\a148 he said. \a147If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\a148\a147Certainly,\a148 said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \a147I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\a148\a147What! where?\a148 shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\a147Oh, it won\a146t do\a151 really it won\a146t,\a148 said Holmes suavely. \a147There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\a146s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\a148Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \a147It\a151 it\a146s not actionable,\a148 he stammered.\a147I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\a148The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\a147The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\a148 said he, \a147and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\a146s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\a148\a147It was only a joke at first,\a148 groaned our visitor. \a147We never thought that she would have been so carried away.\a148\a147Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\a146s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\a146s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\a146s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\a148Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\a147It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\a148\a147The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\a148 said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \a147yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\a148 he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\a146s face, \a147it is not part of my duties to my client, but here\a146s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to\a151\a148 He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\a147There\a146s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\a148 said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \a147That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\a148\a147I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\a148 I remarked.\a147Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\a148\a147And how did you verify them?\a148\a147Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise\a151 the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. \iVoil\a226\a128\a161 tout!\i\a148\a147And Miss Sutherland?\a148\a147If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \a145There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\a146 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\a148\p\BAdventure IV\B - \X1\BThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\B\X1\c\i\m="bosc-02.png"\i\cWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:\a147Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15.\a148\a147What do you say, dear?\a148 said my wife, looking across at me. \a147Will you go?\a148\a147I really don\a146t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\a148\a147Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\a146s cases.\a148\a147I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\a148 I answered. \a147But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\a148My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\a147It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\a148We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\a147Have you heard anything of the case?\a148 he asked.\a147Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\a148\a147The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\a148\a147That sounds a little paradoxical.\a148\a147But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\a148\a147It is a murder, then?\a148\a147Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\a147Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\a151 a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.\a147On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.\a147From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\a147The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\a146s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \a145wilful murder\a146 having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\a148\a147I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\a148 I remarked. \a147If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\a148\a147Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\a148 answered Holmes thoughtfully. \a147It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\a148\a147I am afraid,\a148 said I, \a147that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\a148\a147There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\a148 he answered, laughing. \a147Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\a148\a147How on earth\a151\a148\a147My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my \im\a233tier\i, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\a148\a147What are they?\a148\a147It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\a146s jury.\a148\a147It was a confession,\a148 I ejaculated.\a147No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\a148\a147Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\a148\a147On the contrary,\a148 said Holmes, \a147it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\a148I shook my head. \a147Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\a148 I remarked.\a147So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\a148\a147What is the young man\a146s own account of the matter?\a148\a147It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\a148He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:\a147Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \a145I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \a147Cooee!\a148 which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\a146s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\a146\a147The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\a147Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\a147The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\a147Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\a147The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\a147Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\a147The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\a147Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\a147The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\a147Witness: I must still refuse.\a147The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \a145Cooee\a146 was a common signal between you and your father?\a147Witness: It was.\a147The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\a147Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\a147A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\a147Witness: Nothing definite.\a147The Coroner: What do you mean?\a147Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\a147\a160\a145Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, it was gone.\a146\a147\a160\a145You cannot say what it was?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I had a feeling something was there.\a146\a147\a160\a145How far from the body?\a146\a147\a160\a145A dozen yards or so.\a146\a147\a160\a145And how far from the edge of the wood?\a146\a147\a160\a145About the same.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, but with my back towards it.\a146\a147This concluded the examination of the witness.\a148\a147I see,\a148 said I as I glanced down the column, \a147that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\a146s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\a148Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \a147Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,\a148 said he, \a147to single out the very strongest points in the young man\a146s favour. Don\a146t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so \ioutr\a233\i as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\a148It was nearly four o\a146clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\a147I have ordered a carriage,\a148 said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \a147I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\a148\a147It was very nice and complimentary of you,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\a148Lestrade looked startled. \a147I do not quite follow,\a148 he said.\a147How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\a148Lestrade laughed indulgently. \a147You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\a148 he said. \a147The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\a146t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\a148He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\a147Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\a148 she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\a146s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \a147I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\a146t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\a148\a147I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\a148\a147But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\a148\a147I think that it is very probable.\a148\a147There, now!\a148 she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \a147You hear! He gives me hopes.\a148Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \a147I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\a148 he said.\a147But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\a148\a147In what way?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and\a151 and\a151 well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\a148\a147And your father?\a148 asked Holmes. \a147Was he in favour of such a union?\a148\a147No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\a148 A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\a147Thank you for this information,\a148 said he. \a147May I see your father if I call to-morrow?\a148\a147I am afraid the doctor won\a146t allow it.\a148\a147The doctor?\a148\a147Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\a148\a147Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\a148\a147Yes, at the mines.\a148\a147Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\a148\a147Yes, certainly.\a148\a147Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\a148\a147You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\a148\a147I will, Miss Turner.\a148\a147I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\a148 She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\a147I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\a148 said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\a146 silence. \a147Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\a148\a147I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Have you an order to see him in prison?\a148\a147Yes, but only for you and me.\a148\a147Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\a148\a147Ample.\a148\a147Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\a148I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\a146s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\a146s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\a146 attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\a146s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\a146 insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\a146s innocence.It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\a147The glass still keeps very high,\a148 he remarked as he sat down. \a147It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\a148\a147And what did you learn from him?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147Could he throw no light?\a148\a147None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\a148\a147I cannot admire his taste,\a148 I remarked, \a147if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\a148\a147Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\a148\a147But if he is innocent, who has done it?\a148\a147Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \a145Cooee!\a146 before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\a148There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\a146clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\a147There is serious news this morning,\a148 Lestrade observed. \a147It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\a148\a147An elderly man, I presume?\a148 said Holmes.\a147About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\a146s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\a148\a147Indeed! That is interesting,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\a148\a147Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\a146s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\a148\a147We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\a148 said Lestrade, winking at me. \a147I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\a148\a147You are right,\a148 said Holmes demurely; \a147you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\a148\a147Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\a148 replied Lestrade with some warmth.\a147And that is\a151\a148\a147That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\a148\a147Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\a148\a147Yes, that is it.\a148 It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\a146 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\a146s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little \id\a233tour\i into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\a146s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\a147What did you go into the pool for?\a148 he asked.\a147I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\a151\a148\a147Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\a148 He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \a147These are young McCarthy\a146s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\a146s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again\a151 of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\a148 He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\a147It has been a case of considerable interest,\a148 he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \a147I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\a148It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\a147This may interest you, Lestrade,\a148 he remarked, holding it out. \a147The murder was done with it.\a148\a147I see no marks.\a148\a147There are none.\a148\a147How do you know, then?\a148\a147The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\a148\a147And the murderer?\a148\a147Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\a148Lestrade laughed. \a147I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\a148 he said. \a147Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\a148\a147Nous verrons,\a148 answered Holmes calmly. \a147You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\a148\a147And leave your case unfinished?\a148\a147No, finished.\a148\a147But the mystery?\a148\a147It is solved.\a148\a147Who was the criminal, then?\a148\a147The gentleman I describe.\a148\a147But who is he?\a148\a147Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\a148Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \a147I am a practical man,\a148 he said, \a147and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\a148\a147All right,\a148 said Holmes quietly. \a147I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\a148Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\a147Look here, Watson,\a148 he said when the cloth was cleared \a147just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\a146t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\a148\a147Pray do so.\a148\a147Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\a146s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \a145Cooee!\a146 before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\a146s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\a148\a147What of this \a145Cooee!\a146 then?\a148\a147Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \a145Cooee!\a146 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \a145Cooee\a146 is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\a148\a147What of the rat, then?\a148Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \a147This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\a148 he said. \a147I wired to Bristol for it last night.\a148 He put his hand over part of the map. \a147What do you read?\a148\a147ARAT,\a148 I read.\a147And now?\a148 He raised his hand.\a147BALLARAT.\a148\a147Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\a148\a147It is wonderful!\a148 I exclaimed.\a147It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\a146s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\a148\a147Quite so.\a148\a147Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\a148\a147But how did you gain them?\a148\a147You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\a148\a147His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\a148\a147Yes, they were peculiar boots.\a148\a147But his lameness?\a148\a147The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped\a151 he was lame.\a148\a147But his left-handedness.\a148\a147You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\a148\a147And the cigar-holder?\a148\a147I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\a148\a147Holmes,\a148 I said, \a147you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is\a151\a148\a147Mr. John Turner,\a148 cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\a147Pray sit down on the sofa,\a148 said Holmes gently. \a147You had my note?\a148\a147Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\a148\a147I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\a148 \a147And why did you wish to see me?\a148 He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\a147Yes,\a148 said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \a147It is so. I know all about McCarthy.\a148The old man sank his face in his hands. \a147God help me!\a148 he cried. \a147But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\a148\a147I am glad to hear you say so,\a148 said Holmes gravely.\a147I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart\a151 it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\a148\a147It may not come to that,\a148 said Holmes.\a147What?\a148\a147I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\a148\a147I am a dying man,\a148 said old Turner. \a147I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\a148Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \a147Just tell us the truth,\a148 he said. \a147I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\a148\a147It\a146s as well,\a148 said the old man; \a147it\a146s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\a147You didn\a146t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\a146ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\a147It was in the early \a14660\a146s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\a147One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\a147I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\a147\a160\a145Here we are, Jack,\a146 says he, touching me on the arm; \a145we\a146ll be as good as a family to you. There\a146s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\a146t\a151 it\a146s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\a146s always a policeman within hail.\a146\a147Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\a147His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\a147When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\a148\a147Well, it is not for me to judge you,\a148 said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \a147I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\a148\a147I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\a148\a147In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\a148\a147Farewell, then,\a148 said the old man solemnly. \a147Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\a148 Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\a147God help us!\a148 said Holmes after a long silence. \a147Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\a146s words, and say, \a145There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\a146\a160\a148James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\p\BAdventure V\B - \X1\BThe Five Orange Pips\B\X1\c\i\m="five-01.png"\i\cWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \a14682 and \a14690, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.The year \a14687 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque \iSophy Anderson\i, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\a146s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\a151 a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\a146s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\a146s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\a147Why,\a148 said I, glancing up at my companion, \a147that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\a148\a147Except yourself I have none,\a148 he answered. \a147I do not encourage visitors.\a148\a147A client, then?\a148\a147If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\a146s.\a148Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\a147Come in!\a148 said he.The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\a147I owe you an apology,\a148 he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \a147I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\a148\a147Give me your coat and umbrella,\a148 said Holmes. \a147They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\a148\a147Yes, from Horsham.\a148\a147That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\a148\a147I have come for advice.\a148\a147That is easily got.\a148\a147And help.\a148\a147That is not always so easy.\a148\a147I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\a148\a147Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\a148\a147He said that you could solve anything.\a148\a147He said too much.\a148\a147That you are never beaten.\a148\a147I have been beaten four times\a151 three times by men, and once by a woman.\a148\a147But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\a148\a147It is true that I have been generally successful.\a148\a147Then you may be so with me.\a148\a147I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\a148\a147It is no ordinary one.\a148\a147None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\a148\a147And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\a148\a147You fill me with interest,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\a148The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\a147My name,\a148 said he, \a147is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\a147You must know that my grandfather had two sons\a151 my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\a147My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\a146s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\a147He didn\a146t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\a146s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\a147One day\a151 it was in March, 1883\a151 a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\a146s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \a145From India!\a146 said he as he took it up, \a145Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\a146 Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \a145K. K. K.!\a146 he shrieked, and then, \a145My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\a146\a147\a160\a145What is it, uncle?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Death,\a146 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\a147\a160\a145They may do what they like, but I\a146ll checkmate them still,\a146 said he with an oath. \a145Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\a146\a147I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\a147\a160\a145I wish you, John,\a146 said my uncle, \a145to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\a146t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\a146\a147I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\a147Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \a145suicide\a146. But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 Holmes interposed, \a147your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\a148\a147The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\a148\a147Thank you. Pray proceed.\a148\a147When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \a145Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\a146 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\a146s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\a147Well, it was the beginning of \a14684 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \a14685. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\a147\a160\a145Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\a146 he stammered.\a147My heart had turned to lead. \a145It is K. K. K.,\a146 said I.\a147He looked inside the envelope. \a145So it is,\a146 he cried. \a145Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\a146\a147\a160\a145Put the papers on the sundial,\a146 I read, peeping over his shoulder.\a147\a160\a145What papers? What sundial?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\a146 said I; \a145but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\a146\a147\a160\a145Pooh!\a146 said he, gripping hard at his courage. \a145We are in a civilised land here, and we can\a146t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\a146\a147\a160\a145From Dundee,\a146 I answered, glancing at the postmark.\a147\a160\a145Some preposterous practical joke,\a146 said he. \a145What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should certainly speak to the police,\a146 I said.\a147\a160\a145And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then let me do so?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I forbid you. I won\a146t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\a146\a147It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\a147On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \a145death from accidental causes.\a146 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\a147In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\a146s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\a147It was in January, \a14685, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\a148The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\a147This is the envelope,\a148 he continued. \a147The postmark is London\a151 eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\a146s last message: \a145K. K. K.\a146; and then \a145Put the papers on the sundial.\a146\a160\a148\a147What have you done?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Nothing.\a148\a147Nothing?\a148\a147To tell the truth\a148\a151 he sank his face into his thin, white hands\a151\a147I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\a148\a147Tut! tut!\a148 cried Sherlock Holmes. \a147You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\a148\a147I have seen the police.\a148\a147Ah!\a148\a147But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\a148Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \a147Incredible imbecility!\a148 he cried.\a147They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\a148\a147Has he come with you to-night?\a148\a147No. His orders were to stay in the house.\a148Again Holmes raved in the air.\a147Why did you come to me,\a148 he cried, \a147and, above all, why did you not come at once?\a148\a147I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\a148\a147It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us\a151 no suggestive detail which might help us?\a148\a147There is one thing,\a148 said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \a147I have some remembrance,\a148 said he, \a147that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle\a146s.\a148Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, \a147March, 1869,\a148 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:\a1474th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\a1477th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St. Augustine.\a1479th. McCauley cleared.\a14710th. John Swain cleared.\a14712th. Visited Paramore. All well.\a148\a147Thank you!\a148 said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. \a147And now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get home instantly and act.\a148\a147What shall I do?\a148\a147There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?\a148\a147Entirely.\a148\a147Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\a148\a147I thank you,\a148 said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. \a147You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.\a148\a147Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?\a148\a147By train from Waterloo.\a148\a147It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\a148\a147I am armed.\a148\a147That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\a148\a147I shall see you at Horsham, then?\a148\a147No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.\a148\a147Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.\a148 He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements\a151 blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\a151 and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\a147I think, Watson,\a148 he remarked at last, \a147that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\a148\a147Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\a148\a147Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\a148\a147But have you,\a148 I asked, \a147formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\a148\a147There can be no question as to their nature,\a148 he answered.\a147Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\a148Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \a147The ideal reasoner,\a148 he remarked, \a147would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\a148\a147Yes,\a148 I answered, laughing. \a147It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\a148Holmes grinned at the last item. \a147Well,\a148 he said, \a147I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the \a145American Encyclopaedia\a146 which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?\a148\a147The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\a148\a147From East London. What do you deduce from that?\a148\a147They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\a148\a147Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability\a151 the strong probability\a151 is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?\a148\a147A greater distance to travel.\a148\a147But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\a148\a147Then I do not see the point.\a148\a147There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\a148\a147It is possible.\a148\a147More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\a148\a147Good God!\a148 I cried. \a147What can it mean, this relentless persecution?\a148\a147The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\a146s jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\a148\a147But of what society?\a148\a147Have you never\a151\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice\a151\a147have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\a148\a147I never have.\a148Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \a147Here it is,\a148 said he presently:\a147\a160\a145Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape\a151 a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\a146\a147You will observe,\a148 said Holmes, laying down the volume, \a147that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\a148\a147Then the page we have seen\a151\a148\a147Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, \a145sent the pips to A, B, and C\a146\a151 that is, sent the society\a146s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.\a148It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\a147You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\a148 said he; \a147I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\a146s.\a148\a147What steps will you take?\a148 I asked.\a147It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\a148\a147You will not go there first?\a148\a147No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\a148As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\a147Holmes,\a148 I cried, \a147you are too late.\a148\a147Ah!\a148 said he, laying down his cup, \a147I feared as much. How was it done?\a148 He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\a147My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \a145Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\a146 Here is the account:\a147Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\a148We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\a147That hurts my pride, Watson,\a148 he said at last. \a147It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death\a151!\a148 He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\a147They must be cunning devils,\a148 he exclaimed at last. \a147How could they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\a148\a147To the police?\a148\a147No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\a148All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o\a146clock before he entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\a147You are hungry,\a148 I remarked.\a147Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.\a148\a147Nothing?\a148\a147Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\a148\a147And how have you succeeded?\a148\a147Well.\a148\a147You have a clue?\a148\a147I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\a148\a147What do you mean?\a148He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote \a147S. H. for J. O.\a148 Then he sealed it and addressed it to \a147Captain James Calhoun, Barque \iLone Star\i, Savannah, Georgia.\a148\a147That will await him when he enters port,\a148 said he, chuckling. \a147It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\a148\a147And who is this Captain Calhoun?\a148\a147The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\a148\a147How did you trace it, then?\a148He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\a147I have spent the whole day,\a148 said he, \a147over Lloyd\a146s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \a14683. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these, one, the \iLone Star\i, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\a148\a147Texas, I think.\a148\a147I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\a148\a147What then?\a148\a147I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque \iLone Star\i was there in January, \a14685, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\a148\a147Yes?\a148\a147The \iLone Star\i had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\a148\a147What will you do, then?\a148\a147Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\a148There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the \iLone Star\i of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \a147L. S.\a148 carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the \iLone Star\i.\p\BAdventure VI\B - \X2\BThe Man With The Twisted Lip\B\X2\c\i\m="twis-05.png"\i\cIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. George\a146s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\a146s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.One night\a151 it was in June, \a14689\a151 there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\a147A patient!\a148 said she. \a147You\a146ll have to go out.\a148I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\a147You will excuse my calling so late,\a148 she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\a146s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \a147Oh, I\a146m in such trouble!\a148 she cried; \a147I do so want a little help.\a148\a147Why,\a148 said my wife, pulling up her veil, \a147it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.\a148\a147I didn\a146t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\a148 That was always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\a147It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\a148\a147Oh, no, no! I want the doctor\a146s advice and help, too. It\a146s about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!\a148It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\a146s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney\a146s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\a147Thank you. I have not come to stay,\a148 said I. \a147There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\a148There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\a147My God! It\a146s Watson,\a148 said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \a147I say, Watson, what o\a146clock is it?\a148\a147Nearly eleven.\a148\a147Of what day?\a148\a147Of Friday, June 19th.\a148\a147Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d\a146you want to frighten a chap for?\a148 He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\a147I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!\a148\a147So I am. But you\a146ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes\a151 I forget how many. But I\a146ll go home with you. I wouldn\a146t frighten Kate\a151 poor little Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?\a148\a147Yes, I have one waiting.\a148\a147Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.\a148I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \a147Walk past me, and then look back at me.\a148 The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\a147Holmes!\a148 I whispered, \a147what on earth are you doing in this den?\a148\a147As low as you can,\a148 he answered; \a147I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\a148\a147I have a cab outside.\a148\a147Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\a148It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\a146 requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\a146s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\a147I suppose, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\a148\a147I was certainly surprised to find you there.\a148\a147But not more so than I to find you.\a148\a147I came to find a friend.\a148\a147And I to find an enemy.\a148\a147An enemy?\a148\a147Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\a146s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\a146s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\a148\a147What! You do not mean bodies?\a148\a147Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.\a148 He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\a151 a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\a146 hoofs.\a147Now, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \a147You\a146ll come with me, won\a146t you?\a148\a147If I can be of use.\a148\a147Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\a148\a147The Cedars?\a148\a147Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair\a146s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\a148\a147Where is it, then?\a148\a147Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.\a148\a147But I am all in the dark.\a148\a147Of course you are. You\a146ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here\a146s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!\a148He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\a147You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\a148 said he. \a147It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \a145Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\a148\a147You forget that I know nothing about it.\a148\a147I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There\a146s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\a146t get the end of it into my hand. Now, I\a146ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\a148\a147Proceed, then.\a148\a147Some years ago\a151 to be definite, in May, 1884\a151 there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\a147Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\a146s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?\a148\a147It is very clear.\a148\a147If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\a147Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps\a151 for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night\a151 and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children\a146s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\a147This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\a151 all were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\a147And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair\a146s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\a146s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\a146s clothes.\a147So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\a148\a147But a cripple!\a148 said I. \a147What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\a148\a147He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\a148\a147Pray continue your narrative.\a148\a147Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair\a146s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\a147And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair\a146s coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think they found in the pockets?\a148\a147I cannot imagine.\a148\a147No, I don\a146t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies\a151421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\a148\a147But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\a148\a147No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\a146s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\a148\a147It certainly sounds feasible.\a148\a147Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\a151 what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance\a151 are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\a148While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\a147We are on the outskirts of Lee,\a148 said my companion. \a147We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\a146s feet.\a148\a147But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\a148 I asked.\a147Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!\a148We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse\a146s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light \imousseline de soie\i, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\a147Well?\a148 she cried, \a147well?\a148 And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\a147No good news?\a148\a147None.\a148\a147No bad?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.\a148\a147This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\a148\a147I am delighted to see you,\a148 said she, pressing my hand warmly. \a147You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\a148\a147My dear madam,\a148 said I, \a147I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\a148\a147Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\a148 said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \a147I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\a148\a147Certainly, madam.\a148\a147Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\a148\a147Upon what point?\a148\a147In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\a148Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \a147Frankly, now!\a148 she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\a147Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\a148\a147You think that he is dead?\a148\a147I do.\a148\a147Murdered?\a148\a147I don\a146t say that. Perhaps.\a148\a147And on what day did he meet his death?\a148\a147On Monday.\a148\a147Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\a148Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\a147What!\a148 he roared.\a147Yes, to-day.\a148 She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\a147May I see it?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\a147Coarse writing,\a148 murmured Holmes. \a147Surely this is not your husband\a146s writing, madam.\a148\a147No, but the enclosure is.\a148\a147I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\a148\a147How can you tell that?\a148\a147The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!\a148\a147Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.\a148\a147And you are sure that this is your husband\a146s hand?\a148\a147One of his hands.\a148\a147One?\a148\a147His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\a148\a147\a160\a145Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.\a151 NEVILLE.\a146 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband\a146s hand, madam?\a148\a147None. Neville wrote those words.\a148\a147And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\a148\a147But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.\a148\a147Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.\a148\a147No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\a148\a147Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\a148\a147That is possible.\a148\a147If so, much may have happened between.\a148\a147Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\a148\a147I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\a148\a147I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.\a148\a147And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\a148\a147Very much so.\a148\a147Was the window open?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Then he might have called to you?\a148\a147He might.\a148\a147He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147A call for help, you thought?\a148\a147Yes. He waved his hands.\a148\a147But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\a148\a147It is possible.\a148\a147And you thought he was pulled back?\a148\a147He disappeared so suddenly.\a148\a147He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?\a148\a147No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\a148\a147Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\a148\a147But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.\a148\a147Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\a148\a147Never.\a148\a147Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\a148A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\a147Awake, Watson?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes.\a148\a147Game for a morning drive?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\a148 He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\a147I want to test a little theory of mine,\a148 said he, pulling on his boots. \a147I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.\a148\a147And where is it?\a148 I asked, smiling.\a147In the bathroom,\a148 he answered. \a147Oh, yes, I am not joking,\a148 he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \a147I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\a148We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\a147It has been in some points a singular case,\a148 said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \a147I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\a148In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse\a146s head while the other led us in.\a147Who is on duty?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\a148\a147Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\a148 A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \a147I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\a148 \a147Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.\a148 It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.\a147What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147I called about that beggarman, Boone\a151 the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.\a148\a147Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\a148\a147So I heard. You have him here?\a148\a147In the cells.\a148\a147Is he quiet?\a148\a147Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.\a148\a147Dirty?\a148\a147Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\a146s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\a148\a147I should like to see him very much.\a148\a147Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.\a148\a147No, I think that I\a146ll take it.\a148\a147Very good. Come this way, if you please.\a148 He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\a147The third on the right is his,\a148 said the inspector. \a147Here it is!\a148 He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\a147He is asleep,\a148 said he. \a147You can see him very well.\a148We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\a147He\a146s a beauty, isn\a146t he?\a148 said the inspector.\a147He certainly needs a wash,\a148 remarked Holmes. \a147I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\a148 He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\a147He! he! You are a funny one,\a148 chuckled the inspector.\a147Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\a148\a147Well, I don\a146t know why not,\a148 said the inspector. \a147He doesn\a146t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\a148 He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\a146s face.\a147Let me introduce you,\a148 he shouted, \a147to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\a148Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man\a146s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\a147Great heavens!\a148 cried the inspector, \a147it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the photograph.\a148The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \a147Be it so,\a148 said he. \a147And pray what am I charged with?\a148\a147With making away with Mr. Neville St.\a151 Oh, come, you can\a146t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\a148 said the inspector with a grin. \a147Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\a148\a147If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\a148\a147No crime, but a very great error has been committed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147You would have done better to have trusted you wife.\a148\a147It was not the wife; it was the children,\a148 groaned the prisoner. \a147God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?\a148Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\a147If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\a148 said he, \a147of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.\a148\a147God bless you!\a148 cried the prisoner passionately. \a147I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\a147You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.\a147I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit\a146s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight\a146s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\a147Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\a147Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds a year\a151 which is less than my average takings\a151 but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\a147As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little knew what.\a147Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\a146s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.\a147I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\a148\a147That note only reached her yesterday,\a148 said Holmes.\a147Good God! What a week she must have spent!\a148\a147The police have watched this Lascar,\a148 said Inspector Bradstreet, \a147and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\a148\a147That was it,\a148 said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \a147I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\a148\a147Many times; but what was a fine to me?\a148\a147It must stop here, however,\a148 said Bradstreet. \a147If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\a148\a147I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\a148\a147In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.\a148\a147I reached this one,\a148 said my friend, \a147by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\a148\BAdventure VII\B - \X2\BThe Blue Carbuncle\B\X2\c\i\m="blue-04.png"\i\cI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\a147You are engaged,\a148 said I; \a147perhaps I interrupt you.\a148\a147Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one\a148\a151 he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat\a151\a147but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\a148I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. \a147I suppose,\a148 I remarked, \a147that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\a151 that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\a148\a147No, no. No crime,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \a147Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.\a148\a147So much so,\a148 I remarked, \a147that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\a148\a147Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147It is to him that this trophy belongs.\a148\a147It is his hat.\a148\a147No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\a146s fire. The facts are these: about four o\a146clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man\a146s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\a148\a147Which surely he restored to their owner?\a148\a147My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that \a145For Mrs. Henry Baker\a146 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\a146s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \a145H. B.\a146 are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\a148\a147What, then, did Peterson do?\a148\a147He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\a148\a147Did he not advertise?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\a148\a147Only as much as we can deduce.\a148\a147From his hat?\a148\a147Precisely.\a148\a147But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?\a148\a147Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\a148I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker\a146s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \a147H. B.\a148 were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\a147I can see nothing,\a148 said I, handing it back to my friend.\a147On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.\a148\a147Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\a148He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him. \a147It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\a148 he remarked, \a147and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\a148 he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. \a147He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\a148\a147You are certainly joking, Holmes.\a148\a147Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\a148\a147I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\a148For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. \a147It is a question of cubic capacity,\a148 said he; \a147a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\a148\a147The decline of his fortunes, then?\a148\a147This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\a148\a147Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\a148Sherlock Holmes laughed. \a147Here is the foresight,\a148 said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. \a147They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\a148\a147Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\a148\a147The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\a148\a147But his wife\a151 you said that she had ceased to love him.\a148\a147This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\a146s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\a146s affection.\a148\a147But he might be a bachelor.\a148\a147Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the bird\a146s leg.\a148\a147You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\a148\a147One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow\a151 walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?\a148\a147Well, it is very ingenious,\a148 said I, laughing; \a147but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\a148Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\a147The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!\a148 he gasped.\a147Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\a148 Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\a146s excited face.\a147See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!\a148 He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. \a147By Jove, Peterson!\a148 said he, \a147this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?\a148\a147A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.\a148\a147It\a146s more than a precious stone. It is \ithe\i precious stone.\a148\a147Not the Countess of Morcar\a146s blue carbuncle?\a148 I ejaculated.\a147Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in \iThe Times\i every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\a148\a147A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!\a148 The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\a147That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\a148\a147It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\a148 I remarked.\a147Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\a146s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.\a148 He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:\a147Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\a146s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\a148\a147Hum! So much for the police-court,\a148 said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. \a147The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\a148\a147What will you say?\a148\a147Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: \a145Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\a146 That is clear and concise.\a148\a147Very. But will he see it?\a148\a147Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\a148\a147In which, sir?\a148\a147Oh, in the \iGlobe\i, \iStar\i, \iPall Mall\i, \iSt. James\a146s Gazette\i, \iEvening News\i, \iStandard\i, \iEcho\i, and any others that occur to you.\a148\a147Very well, sir. And this stone?\a148\a147Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\a148When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. \a147It\a146s a bonny thing,\a148 said he. \a147Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil\a146s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I\a146ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\a148\a147Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\a148\a147I cannot tell.\a148\a147Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\a148\a147It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\a148\a147And you can do nothing until then?\a148\a147Nothing.\a148\a147In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\a148\a147Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.\a148I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\a146 room.\a147Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,\a148 said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. \a147Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?\a148\a147Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\a148He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\a146 surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\a147We have retained these things for some days,\a148 said Holmes, \a147because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\a148Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. \a147Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were,\a148 he remarked. \a147I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\a148\a147Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\a148\a147To eat it!\a148 Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\a147Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\a148\a147Oh, certainly, certainly,\a148 answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\a147Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish\a151\a148The man burst into a hearty laugh. \a147They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,\a148 said he, \a147but beyond that I can hardly see what use the \idisjecta membra\i of my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\a148Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\a147There is your hat, then, and there your bird,\a148 said he. \a147By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\a148\a147Certainly, sir,\a148 said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. \a147There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum\a151 we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\a148 With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\a147So much for Mr. Henry Baker,\a148 said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. \a147It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?\a148\a147Not particularly.\a148\a147Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\a148\a147By all means.\a148It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\a146 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\a147Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\a148 said he.\a147My geese!\a148 The man seemed surprised.\a147Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\a148\a147Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them\a146s not our geese.\a148\a147Indeed! Whose, then?\a148\a147Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\a148\a147Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?\a148\a147Breckinridge is his name.\a148\a147Ah! I don\a146t know him. Well, here\a146s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. Good-night.\a148\a147Now for Mr. Breckinridge,\a148 he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air. \a147Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\a146 penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and quick march!\a148We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\a147Good-evening. It\a146s a cold night,\a148 said Holmes.The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\a147Sold out of geese, I see,\a148 continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\a147Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\a148\a147That\a146s no good.\a148\a147Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\a148\a147Ah, but I was recommended to you.\a148\a147Who by?\a148\a147The landlord of the Alpha.\a148\a147Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\a148\a147Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?\a148To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\a147Now, then, mister,\a148 said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \a147what are you driving at? Let\a146s have it straight, now.\a148\a147It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\a148\a147Well then, I shan\a146t tell you. So now!\a148\a147Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\a146t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\a148\a147Warm! You\a146d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\a146s \a145Where are the geese?\a146 and \a145Who did you sell the geese to?\a146 and \a145What will you take for the geese?\a146 One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\a148\a147Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries,\a148 said Holmes carelessly. \a147If you won\a146t tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I\a146m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\a148\a147Well, then, you\a146ve lost your fiver, for it\a146s town bred,\a148 snapped the salesman.\a147It\a146s nothing of the kind.\a148\a147I say it is.\a148\a147I don\a146t believe it.\a148\a147D\a146you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\a148\a147You\a146ll never persuade me to believe that.\a148\a147Will you bet, then?\a148\a147It\a146s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I\a146ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\a148The salesman chuckled grimly. \a147Bring me the books, Bill,\a148 said he.The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\a147Now then, Mr. Cocksure,\a148 said the salesman, \a147I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\a146ll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?\a148\a147Well?\a148\a147That\a146s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D\a146you see? Well, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.\a148\a147Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\a151249,\a148 read Holmes.\a147Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.\a148Holmes turned to the page indicated. \a147Here you are, \a145Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\a146\a160\a148\a147Now, then, what\a146s the last entry?\a148\a147\a160\a145December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.\a146\a160\a148\a147Quite so. There you are. And underneath?\a148\a147\a160\a145Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.\a146\a160\a148\a147What have you to say now?\a148Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\a147When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \i\a145Pink \a145un\a146\i protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\a148 said he. \a147I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\a151\a148His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\a147I\a146ve had enough of you and your geese,\a148 he shouted. \a147I wish you were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\a146ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and I\a146ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?\a148\a147No; but one of them was mine all the same,\a148 whined the little man.\a147Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.\a148\a147She told me to ask you.\a148\a147Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I\a146ve had enough of it. Get out of this!\a148 He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\a147Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\a148 whispered Holmes. \a147Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\a148 Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\a147Who are you, then? What do you want?\a148 he asked in a quavering voice.\a147You will excuse me,\a148 said Holmes blandly, \a147but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.\a148\a147You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?\a148\a147My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don\a146t know.\a148\a147But you can know nothing of this?\a148\a147Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.\a148\a147Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\a148 cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. \a147I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\a148Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. \a147In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,\a148 said he. \a147But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\a148The man hesitated for an instant. \a147My name is John Robinson,\a148 he answered with a sidelong glance.\a147No, no; the real name,\a148 said Holmes sweetly. \a147It is always awkward doing business with an \ialias\i.\a148A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. \a147Well then,\a148 said he, \a147my real name is James Ryder.\a148\a147Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\a148The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\a147Here we are!\a148 said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. \a147The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested\a151 white, with a black bar across the tail.\a148Ryder quivered with emotion. \a147Oh, sir,\a148 he cried, \a147can you tell me where it went to?\a148\a147It came here.\a148\a147Here?\a148\a147Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don\a146t wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead\a151 the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here in my museum.\a148Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\a147The game\a146s up, Ryder,\a148 said Holmes quietly. \a147Hold up, man, or you\a146ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He\a146s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!\a148For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\a147I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\a146s?\a148\a147It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\a148 said he in a crackling voice.\a147I see\a151 her ladyship\a146s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady\a146s room\a151 you and your confederate Cusack\a151 and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then\a151\a148Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\a146s knees. \a147For God\a146s sake, have mercy!\a148 he shrieked. \a147Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I\a146ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don\a146t bring it into court! For Christ\a146s sake, don\a146t!\a148\a147Get back into your chair!\a148 said Holmes sternly. \a147It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\a148\a147I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break down.\a148\a147Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\a148Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. \a147I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,\a148 said he. \a147When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\a146s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\a147I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\a147My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds\a151 a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\a147\a160\a145Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\a146 says she.\a147\a160\a145Well,\a146 said I, \a145you said you\a146d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh,\a146 says she, \a145we\a146ve set yours aside for you\a151 Jem\a146s bird, we call it. It\a146s the big white one over yonder. There\a146s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\a146\a147\a160\a145Thank you, Maggie,\a146 says I; \a145but if it is all the same to you, I\a146d rather have that one I was handling just now.\a146\a147\a160\a145The other is a good three pound heavier,\a146 said she, \a145and we fattened it expressly for you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Never mind. I\a146ll have the other, and I\a146ll take it now,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Oh, just as you like,\a146 said she, a little huffed. \a145Which is it you want, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.\a146\a147Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\a146s, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\a147\a160\a145Where are they all, Maggie?\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Gone to the dealer\a146s, Jem.\a146\a147\a160\a145Which dealer\a146s?\a146\a147\a160\a145Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\a146\a147\a160\a145But was there another with a barred tail?\a146 I asked, \a145the same as the one I chose?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\a146\a147Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now\a151 and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!\a148 He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\a146 finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\a147Get out!\a148 said he.\a147What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!\a148\a147No more words. Get out!\a148And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\a147After all, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \a147I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\a148\p\BAdventure VIII\B - \X1\BThe Speckled Band\B\X1\c\i\m="SPEC-08.png"\i\cOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.It was early in April in the year \a14683 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\a147Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147but it\a146s the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\a148\a147What is it, then\a151 a fire?\a148\a147No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\a148\a147My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\a148I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\a147Good-morning, madam,\a148 said Holmes cheerily. \a147My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\a148\a147It is not cold which makes me shiver,\a148 said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\a147What, then?\a148\a147It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\a148 She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\a147You must not fear,\a148 said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. \a147We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\a148\a147You know me, then?\a148\a147No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\a148The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\a147There is no mystery, my dear madam,\a148 said he, smiling. \a147The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\a148\a147Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\a148 said she. \a147I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to\a151 none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\a148Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\a147Farintosh,\a148 said he. \a147Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\a148\a147Alas!\a148 replied our visitor, \a147the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\a148\a147I am all attention, madam.\a148\a147My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\a148Holmes nodded his head. \a147The name is familiar to me,\a148 said he.\a147The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\a147When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\a146s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money\a151 not less than 1000 pounds a year\a151 and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died\a151 she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\a147But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\a146s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\a147Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\a147You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\a148\a147Your sister is dead, then?\a148\a147She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother\a146s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\a146s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\a148Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\a147Pray be precise as to details,\a148 said he.\a147It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott\a146s, the second my sister\a146s, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\a148\a147Perfectly so.\a148\a147The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o\a146clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\a147\a160\a145Tell me, Helen,\a146 said she, \a145have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\a146\a147\a160\a145Never,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly not. But why?\a146\a147\a160\a145Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from\a151 perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\a146 She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\a148\a147Indeed,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\a148\a147Always.\a148\a147And why?\a148\a147I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\a148\a147Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\a148\a147I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister\a146s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister\a146s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \a145Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\a146 There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\a146s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister\a146s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\a148\a147One moment,\a148 said Holmes, \a147are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?\a148\a147That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\a148\a147Was your sister dressed?\a148\a147No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\a148\a147Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?\a148\a147He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott\a146s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\a148\a147How about poison?\a148\a147The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\a148\a147What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\a148\a147It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\a148\a147Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\a148\a147Yes, there are nearly always some there.\a148\a147Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\a151 a speckled band?\a148\a147Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\a148Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\a147These are very deep waters,\a148 said he; \a147pray go on with your narrative.\a148\a147Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage\a151 Percy Armitage\a151 the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\a148\a147You have done wisely,\a148 said my friend. \a147But have you told me all?\a148\a147Yes, all.\a148\a147Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\a148\a147Why, what do you mean?\a148For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\a146s knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\a147You have been cruelly used,\a148 said Holmes.The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \a147He is a hard man,\a148 she said, \a147and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\a148There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\a147This is a very deep business,\a148 he said at last. \a147There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\a148\a147As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\a148\a147Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\a148\a147I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o\a146clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\a148 \a147And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?\a148\a147No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\a148 She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\a147And what do you think of it all, Watson?\a148 asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\a147It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\a148\a147Dark enough and sinister enough.\a148\a147Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\a148\a147What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\a148\a147I cannot think.\a148\a147When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\a146s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\a148\a147But what, then, did the gipsies do?\a148\a147I cannot imagine.\a148\a147I see many objections to any such theory.\a148\a147And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!\a148The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\a147Which of you is Holmes?\a148 asked this apparition.\a147My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\a148 said my companion quietly.\a147I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\a148\a147Indeed, Doctor,\a148 said Holmes blandly. \a147Pray take a seat.\a148\a147I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\a148\a147It is a little cold for the time of the year,\a148 said Holmes.\a147What has she been saying to you?\a148 screamed the old man furiously.\a147But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\a148 continued my companion imperturbably.\a147Ha! You put me off, do you?\a148 said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \a147I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\a148My friend smiled.\a147Holmes, the busybody!\a148His smile broadened.\a147Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\a148Holmes chuckled heartily. \a147Your conversation is most entertaining,\a148 said he. \a147When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\a148\a147I will go when I have said my say. Don\a146t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\a148 He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\a147See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\a148 he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\a147He seems a very amiable person,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\a148 As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\a147Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\a146 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\a148It was nearly one o\a146clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\a147I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\a148 said he. \a147To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife\a146s death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning\a146s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley\a146s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\a148At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\a147Look there!\a148 said he.A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\a147Stoke Moran?\a148 said he.\a147Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\a148 remarked the driver.\a147There is some building going on there,\a148 said Holmes; \a147that is where we are going.\a148\a147There\a146s the village,\a148 said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \a147but if you want to get to the house, you\a146ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.\a148\a147And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\a148 observed Holmes, shading his eyes. \a147Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\a148We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\a147I thought it as well,\a148 said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \a147that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word.\a148Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. \a147I have been waiting so eagerly for you,\a148 she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \a147All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\a148\a147We have had the pleasure of making the doctor\a146s acquaintance,\a148 said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\a147Good heavens!\a148 she cried, \a147he has followed me, then.\a148\a147So it appears.\a148\a147He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?\a148\a147He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\a146s at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\a148The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\a147This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\a146s, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\a146s chamber?\a148\a147Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\a148\a147Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\a148\a147There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\a148\a147Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?\a148\a147Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\a148\a147As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\a148Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. \a147Hum!\a148 said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \a147my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\a148A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\a147Where does that bell communicate with?\a148 he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\a147It goes to the housekeeper\a146s room.\a148\a147It looks newer than the other things?\a148\a147Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\a148\a147Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\a148\a147No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\a148\a147Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\a148 He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\a147Why, it\a146s a dummy,\a148 said he.\a147Won\a146t it ring?\a148\a147No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\a148\a147How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\a148\a147Very strange!\a148 muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \a147There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\a148\a147That is also quite modern,\a148 said the lady.\a147Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\a148 remarked Holmes.\a147Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\a148\a147They seem to have been of a most interesting character\a151 dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\a148Dr. Grimesby Roylott\a146s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\a147What\a146s in here?\a148 he asked, tapping the safe.\a147My stepfather\a146s business papers.\a148\a147Oh! you have seen inside, then?\a148\a147Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.\a148\a147There isn\a146t a cat in it, for example?\a148\a147No. What a strange idea!\a148\a147Well, look at this!\a148 He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\a147No; we don\a146t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\a148\a147Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\a148 He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\a147Thank you. That is quite settled,\a148 said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. \a147Hullo! Here is something interesting!\a148The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\a147What do you make of that, Watson?\a148\a147It\a146s a common enough lash. But I don\a146t know why it should be tied.\a148\a147That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\a146s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\a148I had never seen my friend\a146s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\a147It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\a148 said he, \a147that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\a148\a147I shall most certainly do so.\a148\a147The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.\a148\a147I assure you that I am in your hands.\a148\a147In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\a148Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\a147Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?\a148\a147Yes, that is the Crown.\a148\a147Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\a148\a147Certainly.\a148\a147You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\a148\a147Oh, yes, easily.\a148\a147The rest you will leave in our hands.\a148\a147But what will you do?\a148\a147We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\a148\a147I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\a148 said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\a146s sleeve.\a147Perhaps I have.\a148\a147Then, for pity\a146s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\a146s death.\a148\a147I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\a148\a147You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\a148\a147No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\a148Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\a146s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \a147I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\a148\a147Can I be of assistance?\a148\a147Your presence might be invaluable.\a148\a147Then I shall certainly come.\a148\a147It is very kind of you.\a148\a147You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\a148\a147No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did.\a148\a147I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\a148\a147You saw the ventilator, too?\a148\a147Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\a148\a147I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott\a146s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\a146s inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\a148\a147But what harm can there be in that?\a148\a147Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?\a148\a147I cannot as yet see any connection.\a148\a147Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\a148\a147I cannot say that I have.\a148\a147The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope\a151 or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\a148\a147Holmes,\a148 I cried, \a147I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\a148\a147Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\a146 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\a148About nine o\a146clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\a147That is our signal,\a148 said Holmes, springing to his feet; \a147it comes from the middle window.\a148As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\a147My God!\a148 I whispered; \a147did you see it?\a148Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\a147It is a nice household,\a148 he murmured. \a147That is the baboon.\a148I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\a146 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:\a147The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\a148I nodded to show that I had heard.\a147We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.\a148I nodded again.\a147Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\a148I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible\a151 a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\a147You see it, Watson?\a148 he yelled. \a147You see it?\a148But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\a147What can it mean?\a148 I gasped.\a147It means that it is all over,\a148 Holmes answered. \a147And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\a146s room.\a148With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\a147The band! the speckled band!\a148 whispered Holmes.I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\a147It is a swamp adder!\a148 cried Holmes; \a147the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\a148As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\a146s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\a146s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\a146s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\a147I had,\a148 said he, \a147come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \a145band,\a146 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\a147I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\a148\a147With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\a148\a147And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott\a146s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\a148\p\BAdventure IX\B - \X1\BThe Engineer\a146s Thumb\B\X1\c\i\m="ENGR-06.png"\i\cOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice\a151 that of Mr. Hatherley\a146s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\a146s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth \ien bloc\i in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.It was in the summer of \a14689, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.One morning, at a little before seven o\a146clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\a147I\a146ve got him here,\a148 he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \a147he\a146s all right.\a148\a147What is it, then?\a148 I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\a147It\a146s a new patient,\a148 he whispered. \a147I thought I\a146d bring him round myself; then he couldn\a146t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\a148 And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\a147I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\a148 said he, \a147but I have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\a148I took it up and glanced at it. \a147Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\a148 That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. \a147I regret that I have kept you waiting,\a148 said I, sitting down in my library-chair. \a147You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\a148\a147Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,\a148 said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\a147Stop it!\a148 I cried; \a147pull yourself together!\a148 and I poured out some water from a caraffe.It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\a147I have been making a fool of myself,\a148 he gasped.\a147Not at all. Drink this.\a148 I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\a147That\a146s better!\a148 said he. \a147And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\a148He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried, \a147this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably.\a148\a147Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\a148\a147Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.\a148\a147It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\a148\a147This has been done,\a148 said I, examining the wound, \a147by a very heavy and sharp instrument.\a148\a147A thing like a cleaver,\a148 said he.\a147An accident, I presume?\a148\a147By no means.\a148\a147What! a murderous attack?\a148\a147Very murderous indeed.\a148\a147You horrify me.\a148I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\a147How is that?\a148 I asked when I had finished.\a147Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\a148\a147Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.\a148\a147Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\a148\a147Ha!\a148 cried I, \a147if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\a148\a147Oh, I have heard of that fellow,\a148 answered my visitor, \a147and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?\a148\a147I\a146ll do better. I\a146ll take you round to him myself.\a148\a147I should be immensely obliged to you.\a148\a147We\a146ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?\a148\a147Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\a148\a147Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\a148 I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of \iThe Times\i and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\a147It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,\a148 said he. \a147Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\a148\a147Thank you,\a148 said my patient. \a147but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\a148Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\a147You must know,\a148 said he, \a147that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\a146s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\a147I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\a147Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of \a145Colonel Lysander Stark\a146 engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Hatherley?\a146 said he, with something of a German accent. \a145You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\a146\a147I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. \a145May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\a146\a147\a160\a145That is quite correct,\a146 I answered; \a145but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\a146\a147\a160\a145Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional commission for you, but \iabsolute\i secrecy is quite essential\a151 absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\a146\a147\a160\a145If I promise to keep a secret,\a146 said I, \a145you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\a146\a147He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\a147\a160\a145Do you promise, then?\a146 said he at last.\a147\a160\a145Yes, I promise.\a146\a147\a160\a145Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have already given you my word.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very good.\a146 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\a147\a160\a145That\a146s all right,\a146 said he, coming back. \a145I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\a146s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.\a146 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\a147A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\a147\a160\a145I beg that you will state your business, sir,\a146 said I; \a145my time is of value.\a146 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\a147\a160\a145How would fifty guineas for a night\a146s work suit you?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Most admirably.\a146\a147\a160\a145I say a night\a146s work, but an hour\a146s would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?\a146\a147\a160\a145The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\a146\a147\a160\a145Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\a146\a147\a160\a145Where to?\a146\a147\a160\a145To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\a146\a147\a160\a145Very good.\a146\a147\a160\a145I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\a146\a147\a160\a145There is a drive, then?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\a146\a147\a160\a145That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\a146\a147\a160\a145We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\a146\a147I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. \a145Not at all,\a146 said I, \a145I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\a146\a147\a160\a145Entirely.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller\a146s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\a146\a147\a160\a145I have heard so.\a146\a147\a160\a145Some little time ago I bought a small place\a151 a very small place\a151 within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\a146s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left\a151 both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?\a146\a147\a160\a145I quite follow you,\a146 said I. \a145The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\a146s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\a146\a147\a160\a145Ah!\a146 said he carelessly, \a145we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\a146 He rose as he spoke. \a145I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\a146\a147\a160\a145I shall certainly be there.\a146\a147\a160\a145And not a word to a soul.\a146 He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\a147Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\a146s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\a147At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\a146clock. I was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\a148\a147One horse?\a148 interjected Holmes.\a147Yes, only one.\a148\a147Did you observe the colour?\a148\a147Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut.\a148\a147Tired-looking or fresh?\a148\a147Oh, fresh and glossy.\a148\a147Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement.\a148\a147Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\a147It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\a147\a160\a145Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\a146 said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door. \a145I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\a146 said he, and vanished into the darkness.\a147I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\a147Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\a147\a160\a145I would go,\a146 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \a145I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.\a146\a147\a160\a145But, madam,\a146 said I, \a145I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is not worth your while to wait,\a146 she went on. \a145You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\a146 And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. \a145For the love of Heaven!\a146 she whispered, \a145get away from here before it is too late!\a146\a147But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\a147The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\a147\a160\a145This is my secretary and manager,\a146 said the colonel. \a145By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.\a146\a147\a160\a145On the contrary,\a146 said I, \a145I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\a146\a147He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. \a145Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\a146 said he. \a145Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\a146\a147\a160\a145I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, no, it is in the house.\a146\a147\a160\a145What, you dig fuller\a146s-earth in the house?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\a146\a147We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\a147Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\a147\a160\a145We are now,\a146 said he, \a145actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\a146\a147I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\a146s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\a147\a160\a145What are you doing there?\a146 he asked.\a147I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. \a145I was admiring your fuller\a146s-earth,\a146 said I; \a145I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\a146\a147The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\a147\a160\a145Very well,\a146 said he, \a145you shall know all about the machine.\a146 He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. \a145Hullo!\a146 I yelled. \a145Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!\a146\a147And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\a147I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\a147I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\a147\a160\a145Come! come!\a146 she cried breathlessly. \a145They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\a146\a147This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit\a146s end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\a147\a160\a145It is your only chance,\a146 said she. \a145It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\a146\a147As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\a146s cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\a147\a160\a145Fritz! Fritz!\a146 she cried in English, \a145remember your promise after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!\a146\a147\a160\a145You are mad, Elise!\a146 he shouted, struggling to break away from her. \a145You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!\a146 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\a147I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\a147How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\a146s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\a147Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.\a147It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\a148We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\a147Here is an advertisement which will interest you,\a148 said he. \a147It appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: \a145Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o\a146clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed in,\a146 etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 cried my patient. \a147Then that explains what the girl said.\a148\a147Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\a148Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\a147There you are,\a148 said he. \a147That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.\a148\a147It was an hour\a146s good drive.\a148\a147And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\a148\a147They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\a148\a147What I cannot understand,\a148 said I, \a147is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman\a146s entreaties.\a148\a147I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\a148\a147Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,\a148 said Bradstreet. \a147Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\a148\a147I think I could lay my finger on it,\a148 said Holmes quietly.\a147Really, now!\a148 cried the inspector, \a147you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\a148\a147And I say east,\a148 said my patient.\a147I am for west,\a148 remarked the plain-clothes man. \a147There are several quiet little villages up there.\a148\a147And I am for north,\a148 said I, \a147because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\a148\a147Come,\a148 cried the inspector, laughing; \a147it\a146s a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?\a148\a147You are all wrong.\a148\a147But we can\a146t \iall\i be.\a148\a147Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.\a148 He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. \a147This is where we shall find them.\a148\a147But the twelve-mile drive?\a148 gasped Hatherley.\a147Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\a148\a147Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\a148 observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. \a147Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\a148\a147None at all,\a148 said Holmes. \a147They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\a148\a147We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\a148 said the inspector. \a147They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\a148But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\a147A house on fire?\a148 asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\a147Yes, sir!\a148 said the station-master.\a147When did it break out?\a148\a147I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\a148\a147Whose house is it?\a148\a147Dr. Becher\a146s.\a148\a147Tell me,\a148 broke in the engineer, \a147is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\a148The station-master laughed heartily. \a147No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn\a146t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\a148The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\a147That\a146s it!\a148 cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. \a147There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from.\a148\a147Well, at least,\a148 said Holmes, \a147you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\a148And Holmes\a146 fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\a146 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\a147Well,\a148 said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \a147it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\a148\a147Experience,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\a148\p\BAdventure X\B - \X1\BThe Noble Bachelor\B\X1\c\i\m="nobl-04.png"\i\cThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\a146s noble correspondent could be.\a147Here is a very fashionable epistle,\a148 I remarked as he entered. \a147Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\a148\a147Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\a148 he answered, smiling, \a147and the humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\a148He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\a147Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\a148\a147Not social, then?\a148\a147No, distinctly professional.\a148\a147And from a noble client?\a148\a147One of the highest in England.\a148\a147My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\a148\a147I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\a148\a147It looks like it,\a148 said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. \a147I have had nothing else to do.\a148\a147It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?\a148\a147Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\a148\a147That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:\a147\a160\a145MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:\a151 Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o\a146clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.\a146\a147It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,\a148 remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\a147He says four o\a146clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.\a148\a147Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\a148 He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. \a147Here he is,\a148 said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. \a147\a160\a145Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\a146 Hum! \a145Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.\a146 He\a146s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\a148\a147I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,\a148 said I, \a147for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\a148\a147Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now\a151 though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\a148\a147Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the \iMorning Post\i, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \a145A marriage has been arranged,\a146 it says, \a145and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\a146 That is all.\a148\a147Terse and to the point,\a148 remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\a147There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: \a145There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\a146s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.\a146\a160\a148\a147Anything else?\a148 asked Holmes, yawning.\a147Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the \iMorning Post\i to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George\a146s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later\a151 that is, on Wednesday last\a151 there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\a146s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\a148\a147Before the what?\a148 asked Holmes with a start.\a147The vanishing of the lady.\a148\a147When did she vanish, then?\a148\a147At the wedding breakfast.\a148\a147Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\a148\a147Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\a148\a147They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.\a148\a147I warn you that they are very incomplete.\a148\a147Perhaps we may make them less so.\a148\a147Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, \a145Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\a146:\a147\a160\a145The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\a147\a160\a145The ceremony, which was performed at St. George\a146s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.\a146\a160\a148\a147And is that all?\a148\a147Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\a148\a147And it is\a151\a148\a147That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a \idanseuse\i at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now\a151 so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\a148\a147And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\a148\a147Lord Robert St. Simon,\a148 announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\a147Good-day, Lord St. Simon,\a148 said Holmes, rising and bowing. \a147Pray take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\a148\a147A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\a148\a147No, I am descending.\a148\a147I beg pardon.\a148\a147My last client of the sort was a king.\a148\a147Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?\a148\a147The King of Scandinavia.\a148\a147What! Had he lost his wife?\a148\a147You can understand,\a148 said Holmes suavely, \a147that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\a148\a147Of course! Very right! very right! I\a146m sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\a148\a147Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct\a151 this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\a148Lord St. Simon glanced over it. \a147Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\a148\a147But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\a148\a147Pray do so.\a148\a147When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\a148\a147In San Francisco, a year ago.\a148\a147You were travelling in the States?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Did you become engaged then?\a148\a147No.\a148\a147But you were on a friendly footing?\a148\a147I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\a148\a147Her father is very rich?\a148\a147He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\a148\a147And how did he make his money?\a148\a147In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\a148\a147Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady\a146s\a151 your wife\a146s character?\a148The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. \a147You see, Mr. Holmes,\a148 said he, \a147my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous\a151 volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\a148\a151 he gave a little stately cough\a151\a147had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\a148\a147Have you her photograph?\a148\a147I brought this with me.\a148 He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.\a147The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\a148\a147Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\a148\a147She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\a148\a147A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.\a148\a147And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\a148\a147I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\a148\a147Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Was she in good spirits?\a148\a147Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\a148\a147Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?\a148\a147She was as bright as possible\a151 at least until after the ceremony.\a148\a147And did you observe any change in her then?\a148\a147Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\a148\a147Pray let us have it, for all that.\a148\a147Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment\a146s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\a148\a147Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present, then?\a148\a147Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\a148\a147This gentleman was not one of your wife\a146s friends?\a148\a147No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\a148\a147Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father\a146s house?\a148\a147I saw her in conversation with her maid.\a148\a147And who is her maid?\a148\a147Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her.\a148\a147A confidential servant?\a148\a147A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\a148\a147How long did she speak to this Alice?\a148\a147Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.\a148\a147You did not overhear what they said?\a148\a147Lady St. Simon said something about \a145jumping a claim.\a146 She was accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.\a148\a147American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\a148\a147She walked into the breakfast-room.\a148\a147On your arm?\a148\a147No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.\a148\a147But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\a146s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\a148\a147Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran\a146s house that morning.\a148\a147Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\a148Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. \a147We have been on a friendly footing for some years\a151 I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran\a146s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\a148\a147Did your wife hear all this?\a148\a147No, thank goodness, she did not.\a148\a147And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\a148\a147Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\a148\a147Well, it is a possible supposition.\a148\a147You think so, too?\a148\a147I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\a148\a147I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\a148\a147Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?\a148\a147Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\a148\a147In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\a148\a147Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\a151 I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success\a151 I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\a148\a147Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\a148 said Holmes, smiling. \a147And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\a148\a147We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\a148\a147Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you.\a148\a147Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\a148 said our client, rising.\a147I have solved it.\a148\a147Eh? What was that?\a148\a147I say that I have solved it.\a148\a147Where, then, is my wife?\a148\a147That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\a148Lord St. Simon shook his head. \a147I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine,\a148 he remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\a147It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. \a147I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\a148\a147My dear Holmes!\a148\a147I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\a146s example.\a148\a147But I have heard all that you have heard.\a148\a147Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases\a151 but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\a148The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\a147What\a146s up, then?\a148 asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. \a147You look dissatisfied.\a148\a147And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\a148\a147Really! You surprise me.\a148\a147Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.\a148\a147And very wet it seems to have made you,\a148 said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\a147Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\a148\a147In heaven\a146s name, what for?\a148\a147In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.\a148Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\a147Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\a148 he asked.\a147Why? What do you mean?\a148\a147Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\a148Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. \a147I suppose you know all about it,\a148 he snarled.\a147Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\a148\a147Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\a148\a147I think it very unlikely.\a148\a147Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\a148 He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\a146s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. \a147There,\a148 said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. \a147There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\a148\a147Oh, indeed!\a148 said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. \a147You dragged them from the Serpentine?\a148\a147No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\a148\a147By the same brilliant reasoning, every man\a146s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\a148\a147At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\a148\a147I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\a148\a147Are you, indeed, now?\a148 cried Lestrade with some bitterness. \a147I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\a148\a147And how?\a148\a147In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very note.\a148 He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. \a147Listen to this: \a145You will see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.\a146 Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\a148\a147Very good, Lestrade,\a148 said Holmes, laughing. \a147You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it.\a148 He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction. \a147This is indeed important,\a148 said he.\a147Ha! you find it so?\a148\a147Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.\a148Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. \a147Why,\a148 he shrieked, \a147you\a146re looking at the wrong side!\a148\a147On the contrary, this is the right side.\a148\a147The right side? You\a146re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.\a148\a147And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\a148\a147There\a146s nothing in it. I looked at it before,\a148 said Lestrade. \a147\a160\a145Oct. 4th, rooms 8\is\i., breakfast 2\is\i. 6\id\i., cocktail 1\is\i., lunch 2\is\i. 6\id\i., glass sherry, 8\id\i.\a146 I see nothing in that.\a148\a147Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\a148\a147I\a146ve wasted time enough,\a148 said Lestrade, rising. \a147I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\a148 He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\a147Just one hint to you, Lestrade,\a148 drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \a147I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such person.\a148Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. \a147There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work,\a148 he remarked, \a147so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\a148It was after five o\a146clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\a146s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a \ipat\a233 de foie gras\i pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.Just before nine o\a146clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\a147They have laid the supper, then,\a148 he said, rubbing his hands.\a147You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.\a148\a147Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,\a148 said he. \a147I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\a148It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\a147My messenger reached you, then?\a148 asked Holmes.\a147Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you say?\a148\a147The best possible.\a148Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\a147What will the Duke say,\a148 he murmured, \a147when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\a148\a147It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\a148\a147Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\a148\a147I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\a148\a147It was a slight, sir, a public slight,\a148 said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\a147You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\a148\a147I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\a148\a147I think that I heard a ring,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\a148 He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. \a147Lord St. Simon,\a148 said he \a147allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.\a148At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\a147You\a146re angry, Robert,\a148 said she. \a147Well, I guess you have every cause to be.\a148\a147Pray make no apology to me,\a148 said Lord St. Simon bitterly.\a147Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\a146t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn\a146t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\a148\a147Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\a148\a147If I may give an opinion,\a148 remarked the strange gentleman, \a147we\a146ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\a148 He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\a147Then I\a146ll tell our story right away,\a148 said the lady. \a147Frank here and I met in \a14684, in McQuire\a146s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn\a146t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \a146Frisco. Frank wouldn\a146t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. \a145Why shouldn\a146t we be married right away, then,\a146 said he, \a145and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\a146t claim to be your husband until I come back?\a146 Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\a147The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\a146 camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\a146s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \a146Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to \a146Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\a147Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I\a146d have done my duty by him. We can\a146t command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn\a146t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn\a146t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\a147When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn\a146t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me\a151 seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also\a151 but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \a146Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\a148\a147I saw it in a paper,\a148 explained the American. \a147It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\a148\a147Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again\a151 just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\a148Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\a147Excuse me,\a148 he said, \a147but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\a148\a147Then you won\a146t forgive me? You won\a146t shake hands before I go?\a148\a147Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\a148 He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\a147I had hoped,\a148 suggested Holmes, \a147that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\a148\a147I think that there you ask a little too much,\a148 responded his Lordship. \a147I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\a148 He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\a147Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes. \a147It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\a148\a147The case has been an interesting one,\a148 remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \a147because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.\a148\a147You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\a148\a147From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon\a146s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\a146s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\a151 which in miners\a146 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to\a151 the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband\a151 the chances being in favour of the latter.\a148\a147And how in the world did you find them?\a148\a147It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\a148\a147How did you deduce the select?\a148\a147By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\a148\a147But with no very good result,\a148 I remarked. \a147His conduct was certainly not very gracious.\a148\a147Ah, Watson,\a148 said Holmes, smiling, \a147perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\a148\p\BAdventure XI\B - \X1\BThe Beryl Coronet\B\X1\c\i\m="BERY-09.png"\i\c\a147Holmes,\a148 said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \a147here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\a148My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\a147What on earth can be the matter with him?\a148 I asked. \a147He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\a148\a147I believe that he is coming here,\a148 said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\a147Here?\a148\a147Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?\a148 As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\a147You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\a148 said he. \a147You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\a148The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\a147No doubt you think me mad?\a148 said he.\a147I see that you have had some great trouble,\a148 responded Holmes.\a147God knows I have!\a151 a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\a148\a147Pray compose yourself, sir,\a148 said Holmes, \a147and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\a148\a147My name,\a148 answered our visitor, \a147is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\a148The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\a147I feel that time is of value,\a148 said he; \a147that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\a147It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\a147Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than\a151 well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth\a151 one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\a147\a160\a145Mr. Holder,\a146 said he, \a145I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\a146\a147\a160\a145The firm does so when the security is good.\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145It is absolutely essential to me,\a146 said he, \a145that I should have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\a146s self under obligations.\a146\a147\a160\a145For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\a146 said I, \a145were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\a146\a147\a160\a145I should much prefer to have it so,\a146 said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. \a145You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\a146\a147\a160\a145One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Precisely.\a146 He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. \a145There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\a146 said he, \a145and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\a146\a147I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\a147\a160\a145You doubt its value?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Not at all. I only doubt\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?\a146\a147\a160\a145Ample.\a146\a147\a160\a145You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\a146\a147Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\a147When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers\a146 safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\a147And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\a147So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\a151 a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\a147It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\a147And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\a146s quick insight into character.\a147And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house\a151 sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late\a151 forever too late!\a147Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\a147When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\a147\a160\a145Where have you put it?\a146 asked Arthur.\a147\a160\a145In my own bureau.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, I hope to goodness the house won\a146t be burgled during the night.\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145It is locked up,\a146 I answered.\a147\a160\a145Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\a146\a147He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\a147\a160\a145Look here, dad,\a146 said he with his eyes cast down, \a145can you let me have 200 pounds?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, I cannot!\a146 I answered sharply. \a145I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\a146\a147\a160\a145You have been very kind,\a146 said he, \a145but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\a146\a147\a160\a145And a very good thing, too!\a146 I cried.\a147\a160\a145Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\a146 said he. \a145I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\a146\a147I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. \a145You shall not have a farthing from me,\a146 I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\a147When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure\a151 a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\a147\a160\a145Tell me, dad,\a146 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \a145did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\a146\a147\a160\a145Certainly not.\a146\a147\a160\a145She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\a146\a147\a160\a145You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite sure, dad.\a146\a147\a160\a145Then, good-night.\a146 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\a147I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\a148\a147On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\a148\a147I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\a147\a160\a145Arthur!\a146 I screamed, \a145you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?\a146\a147The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\a147\a160\a145You blackguard!\a146 I shouted, beside myself with rage. \a145You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?\a146\a147\a160\a145Stolen!\a146 he cried.\a147\a160\a145Yes, thief!\a146 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\a147\a160\a145There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,\a146 said he.\a147\a160\a145There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\a146\a147\a160\a145You have called me names enough,\a146 said he, \a145I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\a146 I cried half-mad with grief and rage. \a145I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\a146\a147\a160\a145You shall learn nothing from me,\a146 said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature. \a145If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\a146\a147By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\a146s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\a147\a160\a145At least,\a146 said he, \a145you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\a146\a147\a160\a145That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\a146 said I. And then, realizing the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\a147\a160\a145You may as well face the matter,\a146 said I; \a145you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\a146\a147\a160\a145Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\a146 he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!\a148He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\a147Do you receive much company?\a148 he asked.\a147None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\a146s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think.\a148\a147Do you go out much in society?\a148\a147Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.\a148\a147That is unusual in a young girl.\a148\a147She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.\a148\a147This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\a148\a147Terrible! She is even more affected than I.\a148\a147You have neither of you any doubt as to your son\a146s guilt?\a148\a147How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\a148\a147I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\a148\a147Yes, it was twisted.\a148\a147Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\a148\a147God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\a148\a147Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\a148\a147They considered that it might be caused by Arthur\a146s closing his bedroom door.\a148\a147A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\a148\a147They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\a148\a147Have they thought of looking outside the house?\a148\a147Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely examined.\a148\a147Now, my dear sir,\a148 said Holmes. \a147is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\a148\a147But what other is there?\a148 cried the banker with a gesture of despair. \a147If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\a148\a147It is our task to find that out,\a148 replied Holmes; \a147so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\a148My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker\a146s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\a146 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\a146s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\a146s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\a146s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\a147You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\a148 she asked.\a147No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\a148\a147But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman\a146s instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\a148\a147Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\a148\a147Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\a148\a147How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\a148\a147Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\a148\a147I shall never let it drop until the gems are found\a151 never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\a148\a147This gentleman?\a148 she asked, facing round to me.\a147No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.\a148\a147The stable lane?\a148 She raised her dark eyebrows. \a147What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\a148\a147I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,\a148 returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. \a147I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?\a148\a147Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\a148\a147You heard nothing yourself last night?\a148\a147Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.\a148\a147You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Were they all fastened this morning?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\a148\a147Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\a146s remarks about the coronet.\a148\a147I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\a148\a147But what is the good of all these vague theories,\a148 cried the banker impatiently, \a147when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\a148\a147Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\a148\a147Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\a148\a147Do you know him?\a148\a147Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper.\a148\a147He stood,\a148 said Holmes, \a147to the left of the door\a151 that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\a148\a147Yes, he did.\a148\a147And he is a man with a wooden leg?\a148Something like fear sprang up in the young lady\a146s expressive black eyes. \a147Why, you are like a magician,\a148 said she. \a147How do you know that?\a148 She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\a146 thin, eager face.\a147I should be very glad now to go upstairs,\a148 said he. \a147I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\a148He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens. \a147Now we shall go upstairs,\a148 said he at last.The banker\a146s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\a147Which key was used to open it?\a148 he asked.\a147That which my son himself indicated\a151 that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\a148\a147Have you it here?\a148\a147That is it on the dressing-table.\a148Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\a147It is a noiseless lock,\a148 said he. \a147It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a look at it.\a148 He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\a146s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\a147Now, Mr. Holder,\a148 said Holmes, \a147here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off.\a148The banker recoiled in horror. \a147I should not dream of trying,\a148 said he.\a147Then I will.\a148 Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. \a147I feel it give a little,\a148 said he; \a147but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\a148\a147I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\a148\a147But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?\a148\a147I confess that I still share my uncle\a146s perplexity.\a148\a147Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\a148\a147He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\a148\a147Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\a148He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\a147I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,\a148 said he; \a147I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\a148\a147But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?\a148\a147I cannot tell.\a148The banker wrung his hands. \a147I shall never see them again!\a148 he cried. \a147And my son? You give me hopes?\a148\a147My opinion is in no way altered.\a148\a147Then, for God\a146s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\a148\a147If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me \icarte blanche\i to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\a148\a147I would give my fortune to have them back.\a148\a147Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\a148It was obvious to me that my companion\a146s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\a147I think that this should do,\a148 said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. \a147I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\a146t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\a146-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.\a148 He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\a147I only looked in as I passed,\a148 said he. \a147I am going right on.\a148\a147Where to?\a148\a147Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don\a146t wait up for me in case I should be late.\a148\a147How are you getting on?\a148\a147Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\a148I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\a147You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\a148\a147Why, it is after nine now,\a148 I answered. \a147I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.\a148It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\a147I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\a148 said he. \a147Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.\a148\a147Deserted you?\a148\a147Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\a147\a160\a145MY DEAREST UNCLE:\a151 I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,\a151 MARY.\a146\a147What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?\a148\a147No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\a148\a147Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the gems?\a148\a147You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?\a148\a147I would pay ten.\a148\a147That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds.\a148With a dazed face the banker made out the required cheque. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\a147You have it!\a148 he gasped. \a147I am saved! I am saved!\a148The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\a147There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,\a148 said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\a147Owe!\a148 He caught up a pen. \a147Name the sum, and I will pay it.\a148\a147No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\a148\a147Then it was not Arthur who took them?\a148\a147I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\a148\a147You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\a148\a147He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\a148\a147For heaven\a146s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\a148\a147I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.\a148\a147My Mary? Impossible!\a148\a147It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England\a151 a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\a148\a147I cannot, and I will not, believe it!\a148 cried the banker with an ashen face.\a147I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\a146 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\a147Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\a147As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\a148\a147Is it possible?\a148 gasped the banker.\a147You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\a148\a147And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\a148 cried Mr. Holder. \a147Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!\a148\a147When I arrived at the house,\a148 continued Holmes, \a147I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen\a146s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\a147There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\a147On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\a147It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret\a151 the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\a147And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\a147Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\a146s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\a148\a147I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\a148 said Mr. Holder.\a147Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held\a1511000 pounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. \a145Why, dash it all!\a146 said he, \a145I\a146ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\a146 I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\a146clock, after what I may call a really hard day\a146s work.\a148\a147A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\a148 said the banker, rising. \a147Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.\a148\a147I think that we may safely say,\a148 returned Holmes, \a147that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\a148\p\BAdventure XII\B - \X1\BThe Copper Beeches\B\X1\c\i\m="copp-06.png"\i\c\a147To the man who loves art for its own sake,\a148 remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the \iDaily Telegraph\i, \a147it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many \icauses c\a200l\a203bres\i and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\a148\a147And yet,\a148 said I, smiling, \a147I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\a148\a147You have erred, perhaps,\a148 he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood\a151\a147you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\a148\a147It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\a148 I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\a146s singular character.\a147No, it is not selfishness or conceit,\a148 said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. \a147If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing\a151 a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\a148It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\a147At the same time,\a148 he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \a147you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\a148\a147The end may have been so,\a148 I answered, \a147but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\a148\a147Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!\a148 He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:\a147DEAR MR. HOLMES:\a151 I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfullyVIOLET HUNTER.\a148\a147Do you know the young lady?\a148 I asked.\a147Not I.\a148\a147It is half-past ten now.\a148\a147Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\a148\a147It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also.\a148\a147Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\a148As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\a146s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\a147You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\a148 said she, as my companion rose to greet her, \a147but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\a148\a147Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\a148I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\a147I have been a governess for five years,\a148 said she, \a147in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\a146s end as to what I should do.\a147There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\a146s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\a147Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\a147\a160\a145That will do,\a146 said he; \a145I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!\a146 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\a147\a160\a145You are looking for a situation, miss?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir.\a146\a147\a160\a145As governess?\a146\a147\a160\a145Yes, sir.\a146\a147\a160\a145And what salary do you ask?\a146\a147\a160\a145I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, tut, tut! sweating\a151 rank sweating!\a146 he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. \a145How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\a146\a147\a160\a145My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\a146 said I. \a145A little French, a little German, music, and drawing\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145Tut, tut!\a146 he cried. \a145This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.\a146\a147You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\a147\a160\a145It is also my custom,\a146 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \a145to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\a146\a147It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\a147\a160\a145May I ask where you live, sir?\a146 said I.\a147\a160\a145Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\a146\a147\a160\a145And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.\a146\a147\a160\a145One child\a151 one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!\a146 He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\a147I was a little startled at the nature of the child\a146s amusement, but the father\a146s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\a147\a160\a145My sole duties, then,\a146 I asked, \a145are to take charge of a single child?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\a146 he cried. \a145Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?\a146\a147\a160\a145I should be happy to make myself useful.\a146\a147\a160\a145Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know\a151 faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?\a146\a147\a160\a145No,\a146 said I, considerably astonished at his words.\a147\a160\a145Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, no.\a146\a147\a160\a145Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\a146\a147I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\a147\a160\a145I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\a146 said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\a147\a160\a145I am afraid that it is quite essential,\a146 said he. \a145It is a little fancy of my wife\a146s, and ladies\a146 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\a146 fancies must be consulted. And so you won\a146t cut your hair?\a146\a147\a160\a145No, sir, I really could not,\a146 I answered firmly.\a147\a160\a145Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\a146\a147The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\a147\a160\a145Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\a146 she asked.\a147\a160\a145If you please, Miss Stoper.\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\a146 said she sharply. \a145You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\a146 She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:\a147The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. DEAR MISS HUNTER: Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\a148\a147That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\a148\a147Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,\a148 said Holmes, smiling.\a147But you would not advise me to refuse?\a148\a147I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\a148\a147What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?\a148\a147Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\a148\a147Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\a148\a147That is a possible solution\a151 in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\a148\a147But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!\a148\a147Well, yes, of course the pay is good\a151 too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some strong reason behind.\a148\a147I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\a148\a147Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\a151\a148\a147Danger! What danger do you foresee?\a148Holmes shook his head gravely. \a147It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,\a148 said he. \a147But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\a148\a147That is enough.\a148 She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. \a147I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\a148 With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\a147At least,\a148 said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \a147she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\a148\a147And she would need to be,\a148 said Holmes gravely. \a147I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\a148It was not very long before my friend\a146s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. \a147Data! data! data!\a148 he cried impatiently. \a147I can\a146t make bricks without clay.\a148 And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\a147Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,\a148 said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.The summons was a brief and urgent one.\a147Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\a148 it said. \a147Do come! I am at my wit\a146s end. HUNTER.\a148\a147Will you come with me?\a148 asked Holmes, glancing up.\a147I should wish to.\a148\a147Just look it up, then.\a148\a147There is a train at half-past nine,\a148 said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. \a147It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\a148\a147That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\a148By eleven o\a146clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\a146s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\a147Are they not fresh and beautiful?\a148 I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.But Holmes shook his head gravely.\a147Do you know, Watson,\a148 said he, \a147that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\a148\a147Good heavens!\a148 I cried. \a147Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\a148\a147They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\a148\a147You horrify me!\a148\a147But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\a146s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\a148\a147No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\a148\a147Quite so. She has her freedom.\a148\a147What \ican\i be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?\a148\a147I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\a148The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\a147I am so delighted that you have come,\a148 she said earnestly. \a147It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\a148\a147Pray tell us what has happened to you.\a148\a147I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\a148\a147Let us have everything in its due order.\a148 Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\a147In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\a148\a147What can you not understand?\a148\a147Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\a146s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\a147I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\a146s young wife.\a147Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\a148\a147I am glad of all details,\a148 remarked my friend, \a147whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\a148\a147I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\a147For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\a147\a160\a145Oh, yes,\a146 said he, turning to me, \a145we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\a146\a147The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\a147Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense \ir\a200pertoire\i, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\a147You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.\a147\a160\a145Jephro,\a146 said she, \a145there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\a146\a147\a160\a145No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\a146 he asked.\a147\a160\a145No, I know no one in these parts.\a146\a147\a160\a145Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\a146\a147\a160\a145Surely it would be better to take no notice.\a146\a147\a160\a145No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like that.\a146\a147I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\a148\a147Pray continue,\a148 said Holmes. \a147Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\a148\a147You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\a147\a160\a145Look in here!\a146 said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. \a145Is he not a beauty?\a146\a147I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\a147\a160\a145Don\a146t be frightened,\a146 said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. \a145It\a146s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\a146 sake don\a146t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\a146s as much as your life is worth.\a146\a147The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\a146clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\a147And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.\a147I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How \icould\i my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\a147I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\a147This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\a147\a160\a145Ah!\a146 said he, \a145you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.\a146\a147I assured him that I was not offended. \a145By the way,\a146 said I, \a145you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\a146\a147He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\a147\a160\a145Photography is one of my hobbies,\a146 said he. \a145I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?\a146 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\a147Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\a151 a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman\a146s instinct; perhaps it was woman\a146s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\a147It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\a147There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran\a151 ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\a147\a160\a145So,\a146 said he, smiling, \a145it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\a146\a147\a160\a145Oh, I am so frightened!\a146 I panted.\a147\a160\a145My dear young lady! my dear young lady!\a146\a151 you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was\a151\a145and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\a146\a147But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.\a147\a160\a145I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\a146 I answered. \a145But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\a146\a147\a160\a145Only that?\a146 said he, looking at me keenly.\a147\a160\a145Why, what did you think?\a146 I asked.\a147\a160\a145Why do you think that I lock this door?\a146\a147\a160\a145I am sure that I do not know.\a146\a147\a160\a145It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?\a146 He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\a147\a160\a145I am sure if I had known\a151\a146\a147\a160\a145Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\a146\a151 here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\a151\a145I\a146ll throw you to the mastiff.\a146\a147I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\a146clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\a148Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\a147Is Toller still drunk?\a148 he asked.\a147Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.\a148\a147That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?\a148\a147Yes.\a148\a147Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\a148\a147Yes, the wine-cellar.\a148\a147You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\a148\a147I will try. What is it?\a148\a147We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\a146clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\a148\a147I will do it.\a148\a147Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers\a151 possibly her fianc\a200\a151 and no doubt, as you wore the girl\a146s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\a148\a147What on earth has that to do with it?\a148 I ejaculated.\a147My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\a146t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child\a146s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\a146s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\a148\a147I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\a148 cried our client. \a147A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\a148\a147We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven o\a146clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\a148We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\a147Have you managed it?\a148 asked Holmes.A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \a147That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,\a148 said she. \a147Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr. Rucastle\a146s.\a148\a147You have done well indeed!\a148 cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \a147Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\a148We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\a146 face clouded over.\a147I trust that we are not too late,\a148 said he. \a147I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\a148It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\a147There has been some villainy here,\a148 said Holmes; \a147this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\a146s intentions and has carried his victim off.\a148\a147But how?\a148\a147Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\a148 He swung himself up onto the roof. \a147Ah, yes,\a148 he cried, \a147here\a146s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\a148\a147But it is impossible,\a148 said Miss Hunter; \a147the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\a148\a147He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\a148The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\a147You villain!\a148 said he, \a147where\a146s your daughter?\a148The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\a147It is for me to ask you that,\a148 he shrieked, \a147you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\a146ll serve you!\a148 He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\a147He\a146s gone for the dog!\a148 cried Miss Hunter.\a147I have my revolver,\a148 said I.\a147Better close the front door,\a148 cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\a147My God!\a148 he cried. \a147Someone has loosed the dog. It\a146s not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it\a146ll be too late!\a148Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\a146s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\a147Mrs. Toller!\a148 cried Miss Hunter.\a147Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\a146t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\a148\a147Ha!\a148 said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \a147It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\a148\a147Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\a148\a147Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\a148\a147I will soon make it clear to you,\a148 said she; \a147and I\a146d have done so before now if I could ha\a146 got out from the cellar. If there\a146s police-court business over this, you\a146ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\a146s friend too.\a147She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\a146t, from the time that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend\a146s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\a146s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn\a146t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\a146s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\a146t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\a148\a147Ah,\a148 said Holmes, \a147I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\a148\a147Yes, sir.\a148\a147And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\a148\a147That was it, sir.\a148\a147But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\a148\a147Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\a148 said Mrs. Toller serenely.\a147And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\a148\a147You have it, sir, just as it happened.\a148\a147I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\a148 said Holmes, \a147for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our \ilocus standi\i now is rather a questionable one.\a148And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\a146s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\p\X1\BSir Arthur Conan Doyle\B\X1Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in Edinburgh and sent to the Jesuit preparatory school Stonyhurst at the age of nine, and by the time he left the school in 1875 he rejected Christianity to become an agnostic. From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at Edinburgh University, including a period working in the town of Aston (now a district of Birmingham). Following his term at University he served as a ship\a146s doctor on a voyage to the West African coast, and then in 1882 he set up a practice in Plymouth. He won his doctorate in 1885. His medical practice was unsuccessful; while waiting for patients he began writing stories. His first literary experience came in Chambers\a146s Edinburgh Journal before he was twenty.It was only after he subsequently moved his practice to Southsea that he began to indulge more extensively in literature. His first significant work was A Study in Scarlet which appeared in Beeton\a146s Christmas Annual for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes.In 1885 he married Louise Hawkins, who suffered from tuberculosis and eventually died in 1906. He married Miss Jean Leckie in 1907, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897 but had maintained a platonic relationship with out of loyalty to his first wife. Doyle had five children, two with his first wife (Mary and Kingsley), and three with his second wife (Jean, Denis, and Adrian).In 1890 Doyle studied the eye in Vienna, and in 1891 moved to London to set up a practice as an oculist. This also gave him more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: \a147I think of slaying Holmes\a133 and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.\a148 In December 1893 he did so, with Holmes and his arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty apparently plunging to their deaths together over a waterfall in the story \a147The Final Problem\a148. Public outcry led him to bring the character back. Doyle returned to the story in \a147The Adventure of the Empty House\a148, saying that only Moriarty had fallen, but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had arranged to be temporarily \a147dead\a148 also. Holmes eventually appeared in 56 short stories and four of Doyle\a146s novels (he has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors, as well).Following the Boer War in South Africa at the turn of the century and the condemnation from around the world over Britain\a146s conduct, Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct which was widely translated. Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in his being knighted and appointed as Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey in 1902. He also wrote the longer book The Great Boer War in 1900. During the early years of the twentieth century Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a Liberal Unionist, once in Edinburgh and once in the Border Burghs, but although he received a respectable vote he was not elected. He did, however, become one of the first Honorary Members of the Ski Club of Great Britain.Conan Doyle was involved even in the campaign for the reform of the Congo Free State, lead by the journalist Edmund Dene Morel and the diplomat Roger Casement. He wrote The Crime of the Congo in 1908, a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors in Congo. He become acquainted with Morel and Casement, taking even inspiration by them for two of the main character of the novel The Lost World (1912). He broke with both, however, with the first world war, when Morel (who was rather left-wing) became one of the leaders of the pacifist movement and Casement betrayed England for his Irish nationalistic views. He, however, tried to save Casement from death penalty, arguing that he had driven mad and was not responsible of his act.Doyle also caused two cases to be reopened. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji, who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were dead set on Edalji\a146s guilt, even though the mutilations continued even after their suspect was jailed. It was partially as a result of this case that the Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907, so not only did Conan Doyle help George Edalji, his work helped to establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice. The second case, that of Oscar Slater, a German Jew and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in 1908 excited Doyle\a146s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed. It is not known whether either enjoyed the same resolution as Holmes\a146 clients.In his later years, Doyle became involved with Spiritualism, to the extent that he wrote a Professor Challenger novel on the subject, The Land of Mist. One of the odder aspects of this involvement was his book The Coming of the Fairies (1921): He was apparently totally convinced of the veracity of the Cottingley fairy photographs, which he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits. His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short story collections, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 under the pretence of occultism.\p\X1\BSources & Acknowledgements\B\X1I would like to thank Olivia Adler for permission to use the excellent images from the Pinacotheca Holmesiana website within each book.The text is mostly from the University of Adelaide\a146s Open Sources with Project Gutenburg sources used for reference.The text of the Arthur Conan Doyle biography is from Wikipedia.
